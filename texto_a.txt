tool this was stated by the company in a statement in which it also states that these records will be valid for  years this means that with this right the patent owner that is ecopetrol is the only one who can make use of said technology and can prevent third parties from using the patented tools or authorize them to implement them under the conditions that it sets the invention patent for the process for treating heavy and extraheavy crude oil at the wellhead to improve their transportation conditions was granted by the governments of peru and the united states this is an embezzlement technology that works under moderate pressure and temperature conditions which was developed at the colombian petroleum institute this process improves certain properties of crude oil such as viscosity and gravity and seeks to reduce costs in pipeline transportation it also decreases the content of heavy metals which increases the quality of the hydrocarbons in mexico the company obtained the patent for the intelligent hole hunter tool used to detect perforations in the pipes and thus solve the problems they have the superintendency of industry and commerce of colombia granted the

new technologiesbancolombia and ecopetrol adrs had a good year on wall street the good performance of the colombian stock market throughout  helped local adrs listed on the wall street market ecopetrol and bancolombia to boost their appreciation specifically the oil company achieved a  appreciation of its price while the financial entity registered an increase in the price of its securities of  jorge bello equity analyst for equities and securities assured that colombia was the market in the region that showed the best performance in  reflecting to a greater extent the economic fundamentals of local growth this good moment of the igbc has helped increase the appetite towards stocks such as ecopetrol and bancolombia overweighting their titles and favoring the behavior and good marketability of these assets  a similar opinion is held by mauricio hernandez equity analyst at corredores asociados who assures that by taking into account the increase in the prices of the companies securities the relationship that the good moment of the local stock market has with the valuation of the papers the price of the shares of the two companies must be quite similar with the local stock market when comparing titles of the same company the appreciation can be observed in the two markets except for the distortions due to the exchange rate  in addition according to analysts this good behavior responds to the benefits offered to companies by listing their adrs on wall street as bello added these values have become a more obvious form for foreign investors who are interested in investing in colombian stocks and who want to do so directly on the other hand the possibility of entering the us market makes these values one of the strongest and with greater flexibility for external changes  likewise nicolas norena an analyst at serfinco considered that adrs are an important instrument for the local market since being on the new york stock exchange gives these titles an important dynamic and allows the liquidity of moving shares be much higher as for the general market for local stocks we see solidity in the companies international liquidity and the appetite of international agents to participate in colombia and in this adrs are key  regarding the perspectives that the experts share on the performance of these adrs in the future although they are positive they are disparate when discounting the difficult situation the financial system is going through both in the region and at the local level according to norena our outlook for bancolombia is neutral due to the slowdown in the entire financial system in recent quarters in colombia and due to the general situation in the market although we expect that by the end of the year stabilizes at levels of  or  for his part jorge bello says that this should be the year in which the confidence of consumers and the consumer portfolio recovers so he is optimistic about the performance of the financial groups role on the other hand ecopetrol has generated a greater positive consensus regarding its future from serfinco it was said that we are waiting for production to stabilize and for the following year to grow between  and  in addition with the consolidation of the refinery in cartagena a positive impact is expected in its refined branch good position in the region the fact that the colombian stock market was one of the best performing in the region in  means that the securities that are listed there enjoy a privileged position among latin american companies and adrs are no exception as the stock and securities expert stated it is a region on the rise the peruvian and chilean markets stand out which have shown an upward behavior and are economies that remain in constant growth and in continuous expansion chilean and colombian banks have a lot of potential  more local companies want to have adrs although ecopetrol and bancolombia are the only local firms with level three adrs on the new york stock exchange other companies such as grupo exito isa nutresa cemargos corficolombiana grupo sura or isagen are also within the group in an entrylevel position or one other colombian companies want to enter this exclusive group davivienda and grupo avals intention to be listed in the us market is already known although for various reasons such as the international situation the companies did not finally make the leap at the end of last year opinions jorge bello equity and securities equity analyst at ecopetrol we see very well the support that they have achieved in recent years so the data is encouraging and it is an active base of the portfolios of the local market mauricio hernandez equity analyst at corredores asociados being listed on the new york stock exchange is very positive since it is an open window to the world for people to get to know the company in terms of exposureecopetrol is sentenced for an explosion in a section of a multipipeline due to the explosion of a section of the puerto salgar  facatativa pipeline in the rural area of the municipality of alban cundinamarca the state council condemned ecopetrol to pay more than one billion pesos the events occurred on march   when farc guerrillas activated an explosive charge against the pipeline which caused the spill of propane gas and a detonation that destroyed the agricultural facilities the crops and the plantations located in the rural properties of the company fierro avila y cia ecopetrol had rejected the arguments of the lawsuit stating that the damage was caused by guerrilla action in unpredictable conditions for the state oil company since no security system could prevent the loss of fluid caused by the blasting with explosive charges of the lines of conduction  faced with these arguments the high administrative court of justice recognized that escopetrol could not foresee the explosion and that it had adopted measures to monitor and protect the pipeline as well as mechanisms to quickly detect possible failures in its operation however it issued the condemnation considering that the oil company was responsible because the proximity of the pipeline put the inhabitants and neighboring properties at risk as happened in this case although there is no service failure in this case ecopetrol is responsible for repairing the damages suffered by the company fierro avila y cia this is due to the fact that the damage is unlawful and is legally attributable to the administration because it was directed against an objective clearly identifiable as a state within the framework of the internal armed conflict and entailed the materialization of a risk of an exceptional nature  consciously created by ecopetrol for the development of its corporate purpose  indicates a section of the sentenceecopetrol surpassed petrobras as the first company in latin america ecopetrols market capitalization was us   million at the close of the session on friday above the us   million with which petrobras closed capitalization is only a reflection of the confidence that the market has in colombia in general and in ecopetrol in particular but the market has ups and downs said javier gutierrez according to the financial times ecopetrol  owned by the state is the largest oil producer in colombia due to its wealth which attracts more and more international investors for some analysts this capitalization is not due to the fundamental aspects of their business but to recent investment flowsecopetrol outperforms petrobras in market value as one of the most dramatic movements in the latin american oil industry the financial times described the fact that the state company ecopetrol surpassed the brazilian giant petrobras in market capitalization at the close of friday ecopetrols stock market value was us   million while that of petrobras reached us   million although for analysts this type of situation presents itself easily given the volatility of the market for the oil sector it is a fact of great importance and recognition according to hernando barrero president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet this recognition is the result of the successful management that the company has had in recent years it can be expected that it will continue to be an excellent option for investors from colombia and the world  and it is not for less since ecopetrol reached the colombian stock exchange the capital market took a different course and citizens began to be interested in the stock market even more so in owning shares in a company that is supported by the status and it has shown the best results in recent years this shows that it is a reliable option that investors resources are well invested and it has an impact on being seen as an excellent company with solidity it is expected that it will continue to have optimal results with good projections  concluded barrero it should be remembered that the market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of shares in the market by the closing price and it was last friday when these two values were positively combined for ecopetrol it is no secret to anyone that the share price of the local oil company is one of the most valued in recent years which is why its capitalization increases while as the ft states petrobras shares have lost   of its value since  due to a decrease in its business results and the uncertainty due to the expenses it may have to develop the new deposits found according to the president of fedispetroleo alvaro yunes for ecopetrol this means maintaining its excellent image and what could be expected is a revaluation of the share as well as attracting more glances from investors from both the oil sector on the stock market yunes assures that after this news the ball remains in the court of the government owner of  of the company since it is this who will have to see how it can help maintain ecopetrols image in the region what does it mean in stock analysts are emphatic in stating that market capitalization is just one variable to consider but that to compare two companies like these it is better to look at multiples and market value over production that is nothing new last year on particular days ecopetrol had already surpassed the brazilian it must be taken into account that petrobras has a production that is almost four or five times higher and in terms of reserves it has almost six times more certificates than ecopetrols and this is more important says corredores asociados analyst mauricio hernandez an opinion shared by catalina ricaute an analyst at serfinco who assures that ecopetrol has appreciated almost  which explains its rise in capitalization but what must be seen is that in terms of multiples petrobras continues to be larger thus ecopetrol as a share becomes more attractive to investors but this does not mean that the fundamentals of the company can not be stopped from evaluating the opinion of hernando barrero president of acipet this shows that investors resources are well invested and it has an impact on being seen as an excellent companyecopetrol the true jewel in the crown in a few years the company has become a benchmark in the colombian economy and today it rubs shoulders with the largest the colombian petroleum company ecopetrol is not only the largest company in the country but also one of the sources of resources for the national budget more important until a few years ago the mixed economy company  stateowned that has  that is listed on the colombia stock exchange its share is listed on the toronto stock exchange and its adr on wall street  only generated news of labor strikes  union perks and terrorist attacks against them today things have radically changed to the point that it is one of the most recognized brands in the region and even more so in the competitive global energy mining sector yesterday it was news because it surpassed the brazilian petrobras as the first company in latin america by market capitalization according to the financial times comment the market capitalization of the colombian oil company was us   billion at the close of the session on friday above the us   billion that the brazilian petrobras ended up with which is three times larger  the london newspaper underlines that ecopetrol  owned by the state is responsible for most of colombias oil production which with its wealth of resources and a favorable business environment increasingly attracts more international investment capitalization increased  in the last  months and according to specialists on the subject does not respond to the fundamental aspects of the business and is rather due to recent investment flows  capitalization is only a reflection of the confidence that the market has in colombia in general and in ecopetrol in particular but the market has rises and falls  the colombian company is ranked  in the fortune magazine business ranking which measures the  largest companies in the world according to the latest data from the count it gained  positions compared to  increasing its income  in  which amounted to us   million it is expected that when the  results are shown the company will be among the  but what obligations does ecopetrol assume with this good news that has been provided for a few years its first challenge is to strengthen its role as a multinational oil company with businesses in several countries and for this purpose it will have to go from being a creole company full of lawyers specializing in legal matters on oil extraction to a factory with the best engineers specialized in the sector energy miner the other strategic challenge is to continue strengthening its corporate governance its good environmental practices and its modernization on all fronts of its senior management ecopetrol got into the big leagues and should not be less than that challengeepm retains an energy transmission contract for ecopetrol epm won the contract for the construction operation and maintenance of ecopetrols electrical connection to the national interconnected system in magdalena medio these are two power transmission lines with a capacity of  megawatts and a new  volt substation which will support the expansion process of the barrancabermeja refinery the executives of the oil company indicated that with this award the increase in transportation capacity and the goal of reaching  million clean barrels in  receive a strong boost they added that the infrastructure is designed with the highest engineering standards to guarantee the supply and availability of electricity to the company for his part juan esteban calle restrepo general manager of epm explained that it is a  operation and maintenance contract which ensures the entity a source of income during that period close to   billion counted at from the date of its entry into operation scheduled for september  epm will begin in the next few days the environmental procedures for the construction of all the

power transmission lines with a capacity of  megawatts mw and a new  volt substation which will support the expansion and modernization process of the barrancabermeja refinery this was stated to lr by the deputy manager of transmission networks of the company luis fernando aristizabal after explaining that the two companies formalized the award of the contract last thursday which will require an investment of us   million the works were awarded at the end of last year but we have already made it official and signed the contract that will be executed during the next three years aristizabal explained after finishing the construction that will begin in  the facilities will be transferred to ecopetrol for a period of  years through a connection service with a business model similar to the modality of a lease during this year we will be dedicated to studies designs the purchase of material and the procedures to obtain environmental licenses that is going to take us a year and a half then we will start the construction that will be ready at the end of   specified the executiveecopetrol will finance more than us   billion in pesos as one of the measures to face the revaluation of the peso it was approved by the board of directors of the oil company that more than  of its financing should be in pesos and not in dollars the amount he has for his plan is close to  million finance minister mauricio cardenas noted that national banks have the capacity to finance ecopetrols plan and said he expects the amount to rise to  on the other hand the official said that the sale of a portion of the oil company foreseen in the governments financial plan was ruled out ecopetrol at this time is not being considered although the nation is going to have to sell assets of the order of   trillion we will have to analyze what those assets are going to be said cardenas who specified that the oil company is not part at this time of the portfolio of shares to be sold  the executive currently has  of ecopetrol available to sell whose current stake is   of the shares of the oil company are traded on the colombian stock exchange initially the government planned to sell in  around  of the shares of the oil companyecopetrols profit reduction in  would impact the dividend of its partners the profits of the oil company ecopetrol in  will be slightly lower than those obtained the previous year which will lead to a reduction in the dividend that will be paid to its more than  partners this year according to a survey carried out by lr among stock market analysts most agree that the results of the oil company would be  below those obtained in  that is an amount close to   billion see table likewise they assure that the dividend that the shareholders of the oil company can expect would be an average of   which means a reduction when compared to the   that was paid last year however the dividend yield which is the return as a percentage of the share price is still the highest in the oil sector as it will be between  and  we consider that the dividend would decrease by   compared to the one paid in  and would reach   per share in case the company maintains the dividend distribution policy of  of profits this payment continues to be very attractive in the market says alianza valores analyst juan david ballen for analysts the dividend that the company will deliver per share will remain between  and  of the companys profits as traditionally has been done but they rule out an extraordinary dividend like the one that was last year the goals were not met if the growth in profits between  and  which was  is compared with that of this year it seems that the company had gone through a bad time however analysts note that in the fourth quarter there was a recovery in production so what affected the results ecopetrol had calculated a production of  barrels of crude for  however the market estimates that for the fourth quarter production could reach  barrels that is a recovery but the goal would remain far away we have seen better crude production numbers that could be reflected in the end but as we had already anticipated the goals will be difficult to meet the issue of environmental licenses and the delay in issuing them was affecting explained sebastian gallego equity analyst at corredores asociados other factors such as capacity and restrictions on transportation of crude oil and some disturbances in public order in the production areas also had an effect on profits transportation problems and attacks on infrastructure generate monthly losses of  barrels per day on average according to the ministry of mines then since we saw in the last part of the year a greater offensive in attacks this is going to generate some pressure on the total production figure for the oil company said ultraburstiles analyst diego usme although ecopetrol the company with the largest capitalization in the bvc has not announced the date on which it will present its results analysts project that it should occur in the next  days so the expectation remains expectation for oil company bonds the capital market continues to await the decision made by ecopetrol on when it will issue the approved amount of   trillion for the placement of debt this is not only key for the development of fixed income in colombia but it has become a subject of debate given the governments request that it borrow in pesos and not in dollars due to the impact that this may have on the rate exchange for now ecopetrol has not given any indication of when the placement will take place which has generated expectations opinions sebastian gallego equity analyst at corredores asociados according to our estimate  will close with a profit of   billion which is a growth of  compared to  the last quarter helped to recover the results diego usme equity analyst at ultrabursatiles we will be able to see a closing with a higher quarter profit than the third quarter but with a lower rate than it was in  due to the difficulties in the transportation of crude oilecopetrol could not exceed the results of  definitely  was not the best year for the main company in the country the oil company ecopetrol the company reported its consolidated financial statements for the end of the year showing that net income fell  compared to the immediately previous year in  the oil companys net profits were   billion compared to   billion in  likewise ecopetrols operating profit fell  in  when it reported   billion compared to   billion in  in turn the companys ebitda also fell for the year    billion were registered compared to   billion in  losing  the results can be explained since the lifting cost of each barrel produced in  was us   us   per barrel more than the previous year regarding the reported figures javier gutierrez pembrethy president of ecopetrol assured that  was a very challenging year for the company various environmental and operating circumstances had to be faced to achieve growth and positive results for our shareholders we can say that the strategic plan for profitable and sustainable growth is advancing on all fronts  target not met the production target last year was not met either in  the company established that its extraction plans were to be  barrels of oil per day while the consolidated production of  barrels of oil per day was reflected the events that prevented the company from achieving its extraction goal were the various attacks against the pipeline network and the delay in obtaining environmental licenses transportation problems and attacks on infrastructure generate monthly losses of  barrels per day on average according to the ministry of mines then since we saw in the last part of the year a greater offensive in attacks this is going to generate some pressure on the total production figure for the oil company said ultraburstiles analyst diego usme recently the truth is that ecopetrols total production in last year grew  compared to  barrels of oil in  regarding royalties the company last year left a total of  barrels of oil per day  having an increase of  compared to the  reported in the immediately previous year according to the company during  heavy crude represented  of total crude production the fields that contributed the most to the growth of the extraction were chichimene piedemonte pauto and florena and quifa as for the companys proven reserves at the end of last year they were  million barrels of oil reporting an increase of  compared to  in  and according to ecopetrol during the year in   million barrels of oil were added to the proven reserves and the net production was  million barrels of curd  this scenario leaves an operating margin for the company for more than  years the companys press release states that the increase in proven reserves came mainly from extensions of proven area improved recovery and revisions of previous estimates in some fields on the other hand ecopetrol and its subsidiaries drilled a total of  exploratory wells during  this figure is due to the results of the last colombia round  carried out by the national hydrocarbons agency in which the oil company presented the best offers for  exploratory blocks after the results are known there is expectation in the market to know what will be the dividends that the company will distribute to all its partners according to experts as the oil companys profits fall the more than  shareholders will receive lower payments this year for the alianza valores analyst juan david ballen the dividend would decrease by   compared to the one paid in  and would reach   per share if the company maintains the dividend distribution policy of  of profits despite the reduction this payment continues to be very attractive in the market as it represents a yield of   and it is that for analysts the dividend that the company will deliver per share will remain between  and  of the companys profits as it has traditionally been done but they discard an extraordinary dividend like the one that was last yearecopetrols results will not impact the market despite the fact that ecopetrol is the company with the highest market capitalization on the colombian stock exchange bvc the results reported by the oil company on friday would not have a negative impact on the market and according to experts the colombian stock market has already discounted the drop in the companys profits so this situation is not expected to affect the market thus according to the results of the lr futures survey for this week analysts are optimistic and expect that the general index of the colombian stock exchange igbc will reach on average  points gaining  units compared to the close friday in addition they also expect an upward trend in the dollar which will allow it to reach     above its average price in the session last friday the main reason for analysts to believe that the dollar will rise is that the results revealed during the past week of some of the developed economies were not good cristian lancheros foreign exchange analyst at equities and securities pointed out that we met worrying indicators in the eurozone and in japan which makes the market nervous the data for the fourth quarter put down the expectations of recovery  for his part eduardo bolanos an analyst at asesores en valores affirmed that this monday will start very quiet because it is a holiday in the united states however during the week the publication of the feds minutes is expected which will generate volatility the most probable thing is to see falls in the stock market indices and in the commodities while the dollar would be strengthened  on the other hand cristian duarte analyst at global securities is optimistic about what the results of the european union will be this week for the european market despite the weak economic growth data in the fourth quarter of  the the manufacturing sector would confirm the good start to   opinions cristian lancheros stocks and securities currency analyst we met worrying indicators in the eurozone and in japan which makes the market nervous and volatile eduardo bolanos analyst of asesores en valores the most probable thing is to see falls in the stock indexes and in commodities while the dollar should be strengthened this week cristian duarte global securities economic research despite weak growth in the fourth quarter of  in europe the manufacturing sector would confirm the good start to ecopetrols results were positive considering the conditions of  the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez pointed out that despite the fall in profits the results of the company the previous year were positive taking into account the difficult conditions that due to different factors they had to face in  we managed to have an increase of production reaching  barrels which allowed us to have the highest sales that we have registered in history but due to a higher remainder our profits reached us   million however this is a positive result considering the conditions  said the manager at caracol radio gutierrez said that the shareholders meeting will be held on march  and there the dividend for the  shareholders of the oil company will be decided regarding the outlook for this year the manager said they will continue to increase oil production and reserves targeting one million barrels in ecopetrol was the share that was most traded today on the colombian stock exchange the species with the highest trading volume was ecopetrol with   million without variation at   conconcret was the share that achieved the most important rise on the day the price of this security grew by   with closing of   regarding the colcap and  indices the first closed today at  units and the second rose  the general index of the colombian stock exchange rose  to  units jp morgan and bank of america no longer like ecopetrols stock although the market already took for granted a reduction in ecopetrols profits for the end of  the low number of reserves registered by the company in its results report and the increase in the costs of the oil company led to the large firms of the stock market will review their recommendations on the stock the first to publish their verdict on the company were bank of america and jp morgan the first lowered the prospects for the state oil company share going from neutral to underperforming suggesting to investors that the time has come to sell their securities the firm also reduced its target price on paper from   to   as they expect the weak results reported at the end of  to be maintained this year and in  with a reduction of  per year in turn jp morgan alerted its clients in a report to the poor performance of the company over the past year and assures that they expect a negative reaction from the stock due to the published figures the combination of a reduction in production growing safety problems and continuous delays in environmental licenses will impact the companys ability to deliver a significant increase in production and operating results in the medium term explains the bank alejandro reyes director of economic research at ultraburstiles affirms that the outlook outside the country does not look good for the firm investors in the new york stock exchange pay a lot of attention to the recommendations of these banks and it is very likely that this will have a negative effect on the price of the stock which is overvalued according to the analyst the decline in the stock will begin to be seen in the coming days but the shares have not only been seen with a higher price than expected on wall street as local stock analysts estimate that the current price of the companys title is high and indicate that the real value of the paper should be around   despite alerts ecopetrol is still very expensive reyes said despite this it is not expected that the title of the oil company will have a strong loss in its value since on the one hand there are expectations for knowing what the dividend will be which will be known on march  and on the other there are the recommendations made outside the country according to the analyst the companys share continues to be very profitable since it generates dividends above  which is good for investors but it must be made clear that  was not a great year for the oil company and that if this trend continued the medium and longterm goals would not be met sebastian gallego an analyst at corredores asociados said that in  ecopetrol did not meet any of its objectives and if this negative trend continues by  it would be very difficult for them to reach their goal of producing one million barrels despite this the president of the oil company javier gutierrez pemberthy said that his company continues to work to achieve that production goal on the stipulated date likewise the executive assured that despite the red numbers of profits it can be considered a good result if one takes into account everything we had to experience last year gutierrez pemberthy added that last year ecopetrol reported a record production increasing to  barrels of crude oil on average per day which allowed us to have the highest sales that we have recorded in history the bvc security closed without variations in its value despite the fact that in the early hours of the morning the ecopetrol security traded lower reacting to the results of the end of  the paper closed without variation in its price against as of friday at   but it was the most traded paper analysts expect that as a result of the recommendations released yesterday the stock will recede in the next few sessions on a par with the adr on wall street on the other hand the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange colcap closed on monday at  units with an increase of  compared to the previous day conconcreto had the most important increase  with a closing of   while proenergias share was the most devalued losing  to   opinions javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol it was possible to reach a record production of  barrels of crude oil on average per day which allowed us to have the highest sales that we have recorded in history sebastian gallego analista de corredores asociados ecopetrols share continues to be favorable for investors as profits are high with these recommendations the price is expected to drop in the coming days ecopetrol was the stock

for the achievement of the objectives despite the fact that in  they were not achieved usme assures that if the company estimates this projection it is because they see it possible and that the delay factors that interfere in this aspect can be circumvented ecopetrol does not depend solely on itself to achieve this ambitious goal factors such as commercial approvals permits for water management and greater conditions in the security of the infrastructure which has suffered many attacks by armed groups influence the projects of the oil company in the long term specifically ecopetrol and its

fields which will be delivered in  and  respectively diego usme ultraburstiles analyst ecopetrol would have to ensure an approximate growth of  each year to meet the production goal of one million barrels in the dispute with ecopetrol does not reach   million pacific rubiales the canadian oil company assured that the lawsuit on how to apply a contractual clause related to the quifa field for high prices is not in the billions as other sources say it is enough to point out that the expert opinion carried out in the process indicates that the amount under discussion amounts to   million as of september  the company said in a statement pacific rubiales considers that the high price clause in favor of ecopetrol should be made on  of the fields production which corresponds to ecopetrol and not on  of the field as the main oil company in the country intends faced with the information that has been revealed this week about the process that is in the hands of an arbitration tribunal after the attorney generals office supported ecopetrols claims the canadian oil company assures that the ruling that must be issued must be in law and not in conscience  on march  the ruling of the arbitration court will be known that will define whether ecopetrol will have the right to receive greater resources from the quifa field one of the most potential in the llanos basinecopetrol seeks to streamline procedures to place bonds ecopetrol reported that it will ask its shareholders to modify the bylaws so that the board of directors has the power to authorize bond issues and placements in order to speed up the procedures when the company needs to place new papers the proposal is known amid expectations that this year ecopetrol will enter the local market with a substantial bond issue the oil company presented in september of last year a procedure before the financial superintendence for a quota of issuance of ordinary bonds with between  and  years and of commercial papers with a term of less than one year for up to   billion ecopetrol  will present a proposal to modify the bylaws which consists of assigning the board of directors the power to authorize the issuance and placement of bonds not convertible into shares of the company and of other debt securities or securities  as well as the regulation and approval of the respective prospectuses said a statement the companys general shareholders meeting will be held on march  the foregoing in order to streamline procedures when the company needs to use bonds as a source of financing he explained last january the minister of finance mauricio cardenas said that he will ask ecopetrol to concentrate  of its financing this year in local currency and the remaining  in us currency in order to reduce the entry of dollars to the country to contain the appreciation of the peso that is affecting industrialists and exportersthe share that had the highest trading volume today on the bvc was ecopetrol the ecopetrol share was the share with the highest negotiation during the day today on the colombian stock exchange with   million with a positive variation in its price from  to   odinsa was the share that achieved the highest rise during the session the price of its title grew  and had a closing of   on the other hand the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange colcap closed at  units with an increase of  from the previous day the liquidity index  rose  to  unitsecopetrol will propose to empower the board of directors in the issuance of bonds it is possible that the assembly that ecopetrol will hold on march  is one of those that is awakening the most expectations in colombia and now more than before because according to the information published by the financial superintendency of colombia at the appointment it will be proposed to give it the power to the board of directors to authorize the issuance of corporate fixed income specifically the proposal that the company will carry includes the modification of ecopetrols bylaws so that these executives can authorize the issuance and placement of bonds not convertible into shares and other debt securities or securities as well as the regulation and approval of the respective prospectuses this company announcement for daniel lozano director of economic research at serfinco shows that ecopetrol wants to be more agile in order to take advantage of market opportunities naturally what you see with the announcement is that ecopetrol wants to have a channel that is faster so that when it sees the most favorable conditions in the market to make the issue the approval has a shorter route with this the reading is that ecopetrol does not mean that the auction is imminent but it tells you that it could be easier to place  it should not be forgotten that ecopetrol previously announced that it has already obtained permission to carry out its issuance of bonds for an amount of   trillion although at no point has the company spoken about when it intends to carry out the operation in this sense the main change that can be observed in the event that the proposal is approved in the assembly as lozano assured is that to carry out a bond issue the approval has to go through the general assembly therefore that with this measure they would be giving decisionmaking power to the board of directors without having to call an assembly  on the other hand as stated by juan david ballen fixed income analyst at alianza valores the market was already waiting for this proposal to be announced the market was very aware of the company making the proposal since december of last year ecopetrol was expected to carry out its bond issue but it never happened in this way it would be a positive aspect for the company since its objective is to issue its own debt to make payments on the foreign debt  assemblies approved dividends yesterday four corporate assemblies of colombian companies were held the first to report what happened was proyectos de infraestructura sa where the investors who attended gave the goahead to the accounts that were presented which yielded profits of   million which allowed the delivery of a dividend per share in cash of   likewise setas colombianas approved its profits for   billion and the delivery of returns to its shareholders for a value of   per share regarding the assemblies held by inversiones equipos y servicios inesa and the agricola san felipe company it is important that investors who could not attend the meeting know that during the conversations held at the palmira chamber of commerce the companies approved the distribution of a dividend among its shareholders of   and   per share respectively opinions daniel lozano director of economic research at serfinco with this ecopetrol wants to speed up the procedures to be able to act with market movements and when the company requires it juan david ballen fixed income analyst at alianza valores this may bring ecopetrols issuance closer which as the company stated is intended to pay the foreign debt it has subscribedecopetrol proposes to pay a dividend to its shareholders of   ecopetrol proposes a dividend of   per share the second highest value in its history and slightly lower than last year which was   it is also higher than the predictions of analysts who placed it at   the stateowned company announced the profit distribution project for  approved by the companys board of directors and which will be presented for consideration by the general shareholders meeting on march  it is proposed to distribute  of the  net profit as an ordinary dividend plus  of the  net profit as an extraordinary dividend the ordinary dividend would amount to   per share and the extraordinary dividend to   per share the total dividend per share would be   per share in addition the number of installments for the payment of the dividend will be decided at the shareholders meetingthe quifa case would unleash other lawsuits against ecopetrol if the arbitration tribunal ruled in favor of pacific rubiales arguments in the controversy against ecopetrol regarding the additional payment that it must make for its participation in the quifa field much more would be at stake than the oil company would stop receive in that contract the award would unleash a barrage of lawsuits against the mixed company by other companies that would seek to have the same interpretation applied to them ecopetrol and pacific rubiales two longterm strategic partners decided from september   to go to an arbitration process in order to resolve the differences they have regarding the interpretation of clause  of the other quifa association agreement  the disagreement between ecopetrol and the main private oil company in colombia is over the high prices clause which gives a greater participation to the mixed company of the quifa field the second most important for pacific in terms of production when the prices of the oil are high and accumulated production reaches  million barrels a figure that was reached in april  pacifics position which has  of the production of this field is that the settlement of the clause a ecopetrols favor must be made on the amount that corresponds to the private company and not on one hundred percent of the production as requested by ecopetrol it currently benefits from  of the blocks production a source close to the process told lr that if pacifics position prospers companies that have contracts with ecopetrol with the same clause will request that this interpretation be applied to them much more is at stake than what ecopetrol would stop receiving in that contract it would give rise to a number of lawsuits that would take him to court to controversies  according to the attorney generals office the clause represents billionaire losses for ecopetrol due to the additional income during the remaining years of contract execution which began on december   and ends on december   the advisor of pacific rubiales lawyer nestor humberto martinez affirmed that the loss reported to ecopetrol close to us   million is not true suffice it to point out that the expert opinion carried out in the process indicates that the amount under discussion amounts to close to us   million as of september  the quifa block located in the eastern plains was one of the fields that most contributed to pacifics growth in production in  net reserves went from  million barrels of oil equivalent in  to  million in  the net production growth expectations for quifa double from  to  the estimated original oil in situ of the block is of  trillion bbls its total production increased  going from  barrels of oil per day bpd on january   to  bpd on january  of this year while the controversy is settled the conditions of the contract are subject to the formula of the national hydrocarbons agency experts such as santiago angel urdinola vice president of mining hydrocarbons and energy at andi assure that it is still not possible to speculate on the effects of the ruling and that the decision will be resolved by the court in accordance with the rules the director of economic investigations of ultraburstiles alejandro reyes affirmed that in the event of a ruling in favor of pacific ecopetrol being a mixed entity with state money not having a clear contract means that if it potentially loses that award it is at risk some resources that should have won in that order of ideas the attorney generals office could enter to investigate why it happened added the expert the decision must be issued in law according to the advisor of pacific rubiales the lawyer nestor humberto martinez the private oil company and ecopetrol agreed that the ruling must be issued in law and not in conscience in other words the award must be based on the law and on the evidence collected which includes testimonies from former ministers and officials of the time and even the same minutes of the ecopetrol board of directors it is not acceptable that reasons are publicly invoked to try to influence the outcome of the process every foreign investor has an inalienable right to legal security  opinions santiago angel urdinola vice president of mining hydrocarbons and energy of andi you cannot talk about what may happen the conflict must be resolved in court the only certainty is that it is in the hands of the best referees in the private sector the decision will be in accordance with the rules  alejandro reyes director of economic investigations at ultraburstiles since ecopetrol is a mixed entity with state money not having a clear contract means that if it potentially loses that award it loses resources that it should have earnedpromigas and ecopetrol are the shares that so far will pay the most in dividends the dividend proposal of most of the companies listed on the colombian stock exchange is already known and according to analysts the results are positive and show an increase of close to  compared to the payment made last year thus when comparing the projects presented so far with the payment given in  it is evident that promigas and ecopetrol would have the highest dividend yield in the market with  and  respectively this is based on the closing price of last friday february  it should be noted that corficolombiana a company that has maintained leadership in this ranking proposed a lower dividend than last year in pesos but higher in shares so its yield was reduced for the analyst of stocks and securities jorge bello at this moment there is a generation of positive profits and the income of the companies has not been affected by the international crisis this is why according to the analyst the dividends of the listed companies could have a  or  growth these estimates give investors some peace of mind as they will have the possibility of receiving more money as partners the stock analyst of asesores en valores german zuniga exemplifies the good situation of corporate dividends with the cases of some companies of the grupo empresarial antioqueno in grupo sura we see a distribution of   per year per share which corresponds to an increase of  then to reach a yield higher than  said result is mainly due to its participation method says zuniga on the other hand there is nutresa who propose  payments of   per share that is  more compared to the previous year when he paid   likewise the dividend yield which is the share of the dividend compared to its last closing price has an increase of  explains zuniga in this way the average growth is around  for sectors such as retail construction and holding companies according to catalina ricaute serfincos equity analyst in general the companies of grupo empresarial antioqueno show favorable growth such is the case of nutresa and cementos argos while in the case of isagen there is a reduction of  even so i think the balance is more positive but there are cases in the electricity sector where there is a decrease  as we still do not have all the reports from the companies the market is waiting for the proposal made by pacific rubiales inverargos avianca taca and the empresa de energia de bogota a considerable increase is expected from these companies as their financial results were positive for now and as long as the good results of colombian companies are maintained it is profitable for investors to keep their titles and wait for new dividends furthermore this represents an incentive for new investors who would have a favorable return extra payment from ecopetrol surprised a dividend that caused surprise among stock market analysts was that of ecopetrol since no company was betting on having an extraordinary dividend according to jorge bello ecopetrols dividend proposal changed the entire configuration of a possible punishment for the share but that speaks very well of the companys possibility of cash and not requiring financing i would say that this dividend did take the market by surprise and yesterdays opening saw that the stock rose again  given the companys results it is surprising that an extraordinary dividend has been proposed since only a payment of no more than   had been considered the opinions catalina ricaute analyst of shares of serfinco we can highlight the proposals of the grupo empresarial antioqueno which show an increase close to  jorge bello stock and securities analyst the market is waiting for dividends from companies such as pacific rubiales avianca cemargos inverargos and eebecopetrol was the share that was most traded today on the colombian stock exchange the share with the highest trading volume was ecopetrol with   million positive variation in its price from  to   for its part cnec canacol was the share that achieved the most important rise during the session  the liquidity index  fell  to  units during the session likewise the igbc fell  to  units the colcap index closed with an increase of  at  unitsthe decision taken will not affect the other contracts of ecopetrol pacific pacific rubiales has ruled on the warning that lr made yesterday about the decision that the arbitration court may take that is taking the case against the countrys main oil company ecopetrol in which the state company would be affected by new lawsuits from this same guy and as mentioned in the article this lawsuit by the private oil company for differences in the quifa field would unleash a barrage of lawsuits against the joint venture according to the pacific rubiales lawyer nestor humberto martinez this lawsuit will not affect the other contracts that ecopetrol has with other companies because the high price participation clause ppa was only agreed in a few contracts formalized between june of  and december  and in all those contracts with the exception of quifa it was foreseen that the ppa would be settled on  of the production or exclusively on the participation of the state associate  the contracts that are in these two situations as confirmed by the same lawyer are those of guachiria gaviotas el algarrobo el queso and achira the truth is that in the case of the quifa field as martinez affirmed it is that there was silence on the basis of the liquidation of the ppa and therefore it is currently in the arbitration court in other words pacific has doubts about the conditions under which the agreement was reached and that is why the case must be resolved in court it should be added that since  all contracts that have been signed before the national hydrocarbons agency anh the ppa is settled on the production that corresponds to the associated company and not to the state ecopetrol industry experts have suggested that one should not anticipate the facts and that one should wait for it to fail the case is handled by the best arbitrators in the country and nothing can be concluded before the decision is issued said santiago angel urdinola vice president of mining hydrocarbons and energy at andiin  more than   billion ecopetrol managed in contracting at the end of  the contracting managed by ecopetrol exceeded   billion with local national and foreign suppliers the figure was  higher than that registered in  of   billion last year the company did business for   billion with national suppliers for   billion with regional and local suppliers and for   million with foreign suppliers where there was a total of  suppliers with whom contracts were managed in  achieving  of the total national contracting ecopetrol had a significant trading record in the magdalena medio region where goods and services were contracted for more than   billion in addition to electrical works networks maintenance among other works and there was a contract for the order of   million in the central east region   in the caribbean region   million in the orinoquia region   million in the west region and   million in the southern region in the caribbean region with  entrepreneurs in magdalena medio with  in the western zone with  in the center of the country with  in bogota with  in the orinoquia with  and in the south of the country with ecopetrol was the most traded share on the stock exchange ecopetrols share was the most traded on the stock exchange even after being one of the main stocks that reported a

which fell  of the  transactions registered on the stock exchange the share that was traded the most was that of ecopetrol which moved an amount of   million and the pacific rubiales share with   million on the other hand proenergia achieved the most important rise during the session the price of this security grew  closing at   the valorem share also stood out whose price grew by  despite

most traded share on the stock market the paper moved   million but the share price fell  the share of the company cemex latam holdings dedicated to the storage transportation and distribution of fuel hydrocarbons and petroleum products stood out today on the stock market as it was the one that traded the most increasing  while banco bbvas paper was the one that devalued the most with  for its part the most traded security was ecopetrol which was at   the pacific rubiales share which yesterday ranked first in terms of trading volume ranked second today by moving   million the colcap index fell  to  units the  fell  and the igbc this week the mess between ecopetrol and pacific over the quifa case will be defined this will be a final week for the lawsuit that separates the two largest oil companies in the country the decision made by the arbitration tribunal next wednesday will decide the future of payments in the quifa field which must be made by pacific rubiales to ecopetrol state bodies have already spoken out about this lawsuit the attorney generals office issued a concept which does not have binding force it is a recommendation in which it says that the state oil company could be right the bone of contention between the parties consists of an association contract which establishes that upon reaching a production of  million barrels the canadian oil company will have to pay more profits to the colombian company ecopetrol wants this payment to be made on  of the fields production while pacific rubiales says that it should be made on  which is what corresponds to it two myths have arisen around this lawsuit and pacific rubiales has come out to disprove them the first of these is that it is estimated that a series of lawsuits will be brought to ecopetrol for contracts that are similar to quifa  but the lawyer for the canadian company nestor humberto martinez pointed out that unlike all the signed association contracts this one has different conditions the other speculation is that this fight would leave billions of dollars in losses for the companies but a pacific statement ensures that the amount under discussion amounts to   million as of september  so far the companies have not wanted to rule on the issue but they trust the judgment of the court that will rule and ensure that their business relationships will not be affected in the futureecopetrol registered the highest trading volume of the day today the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange colcap closed with an increase of  compared to the previous day registering a negative variation of  so far this year on the other hand ecopetrol obtained the highest trading volume of   million while fabricato achieved the most important increase with a growth of

gruposura also dropped  the  liquidity index rose  and the igbc fell fitch ratings improves ecopetrols outlook to positive the agency improved the oil companys rating outlook from stable to positive in line with the improvement in colombian debt likewise fitch ratings maintained ecopetrols ratings in local and foreign currency at bbb and bbb respectively the companys share was the most devalued at  in the morning on the colombian stock exchange with a decrease of  to   however it is the most negotiated last week the agency increased the outlook for colombias sovereign debt from stable to positive and kept the rating at bbb this is considered the first step to an increase in the countrys ratingecopetrol beat pacific the bid for quifa field the arbitration court agreed with ecopetrol and the state oil company won from pacific rubiales the difference that existed in a clause of the association contract in the quifa block finally the court ended up heeding the recommendation issued by the attorney generals office in which it was explained that ecopetrol was right the two companies which are also strategic partners in more oil operations decided on december   to go to the arbitration process to resolve differences regarding the interpretation of clause  of the quifa association contract the difference that separated the two companies was the high prices clause which granted ecopetrol a greater participation in the field when international crude prices are high and the blocks accumulated production exceeds  million barrels figure that was reached in april pacific will have to pay for  of the quifa field to ecopetrol ecopetrol beat pacific rubiales the fight for the interpretation of the high prices clause that is consigned in the association contract of the quifa field the award issued by the arbitration tribunal explains that the valid interpretation of payment is that of the local oil company which required the canadian to cancel a greater proportion of production when crude prices were high and a production of  was reached million barrels in the field the difference lies in the equation while ecopetrol said that the payment for this oil should be assessed on the entire production pacific expected it to be made on  which is the participation that the company has on the quifa field in addition to this concept the claim that the colombian oil company had that close to us   million be canceled was declared by the court as something outside its jurisdiction according to pacifics attorney nestor humberto martinez the court did not convict either party there was a procedural tie  the lawyer assures that he still has resources that could be sought to have the ruling annulled what is coming one of the ecopetrol representatives assured that from now on the bill of collection that will be requested from the canadian firm is being prepared so that the high prices clause that it owes for the years  and  it should be paid remember that the case was taken to arbitration in september  according to martinez the directors of the canadian company would evaluate the possibility of taking new actions to continue with the lawsuit one way out that pacific has left is to seek the state council to annul this decision but there are not enough arguments for that entity to heed the claims of the oil company according to experts consulted by this newspaper quifa will double its production the quifa block will be the main asset of the canadian oil company from  the private company is currently implementing its star pilot project in that block with which it is expected to double crude oil production from  barrels of hydrocarbon per day to more than  currently the participation in this oil block is  for pacific rubiales while the remainder belongs to ecopetrol the decision made by the court was final the award made by the arbitration court of the bogota chamber of commerce in which ecopetrol was the winner against pacific rubiales ruled in final instance that is no appeal can be presented later for the arbitration expert juan pablo riveros in arbitration there is no second instance the award can only be attacked by means of two remedies one for annulment which would be due to procedural errors and the other due to restriction  opinions amylkar acosta member of the board of directors of ecopetrol if ecopetrol had not won a series of lawsuits would have been unleashed against the company for the interpretation of the clauses nestor humberto martinez attorney at pacific rubiales the arbitration tribunal did not convict either party here there was a procedural tie they only won one of their claims get organized to attend the ecopetrol meeting the season of ordinary shareholders meetings is coming to an end

development of heavy crude oil is concentrated in this region of the country one of the axes of the strategy to increase oil production and reserves in the coming years colombia the fourth largest producer of crude oil in latin america has oil reserves of  billion barrels and seeks to increase them with new discoveries amid the boom in the sector encouraged by the recovery of safety in exploration areas which until recently some years they were controlled by leftist guerrillas the dynamism of the sector has been supported by the strong increase in foreign direct investment the south american country produced an average of  bpd in  despite an upsurge in attacks by leftist guerrillas against the pipeline network and the oil sectorecopetrols dividend in a fee would boost the action although yesterday after several sessions to the downside ecopetrols share rose again it still cannot recover the   it lost earlier this week however the decision made at todays meeting regarding the amount of installments in which the dividend will be paid becomes the main option for the companys stock to go back on the rise follow here live the live broadcast of the assembly this was explained by the ultraburstiles variable income analyst diego usme who assured that prior to the exdividend period of the oil company a rebound in the price of paper can be expected if the dividend is finally given in a quota that would cause a boost not too strong but above   furthermore the performance will be more attractive and will attract more investors  similarly jose dario lozano head of shares at alianza valores considered that the payment in a single installment would generate the interest of more investors in the oil company which would boost the action we think that if the payment is approved in a quota it would have a positive impact on the action and above all it would generate the entry of new investors who would seek to make a strategy with the dividend this would take ecopetrols securities above   until the moment the dividend is paid when investors go out to sell  the explanation for this entry of investors would be the return of almost  that it would give them by having positions in the title it is worth remembering that the national government like last year asked the company to make the payment only once so the proposal will probably be accepted seeing the trend shown in the stock market in recent sessions the stock is adjusting to the projections of the commission agents after the reduction in profits and the bad figures it recorded in production which prevented it from reaching the goal that was had taxed  barrels a day despite this the state oil company surprised this tuesday with a new discovery in the puerto gaitan area which will contribute  barrels per day which according to analysts such as sebastian gallego an expert in variable income at corredores asociados will have an irrelevant impact on the share price due to the size of the discovery as it does not represent even  of the companys total production of course according to diego usme it will be necessary to look at his future potential for ecopetrol it is positive because it is the first discovery of  and although now it will have practically no impact on the stock the company is carrying out more exploration in the area and the real potential of this new block remains to be seen another fundamental point that will be discussed in the event has to do with the change of statutes with which it is intended that the board choose the moment to carry out the bond issuance that it has already approved for   billion thus in todays assembly the line that will surely mark the performance of the stock of the oil company in the coming months will be given local stock indices continue to lose the uncertainty that cyprus has been experiencing since the weekend continues to affect the worlds stock markets including the colombian one in yesterdays session the local indices of the bvc remained in the red a result of external nervousness the colcap closed on wednesday at  units with a decrease of  compared to the previous day thus accumulating a decrease of  for the year while igbc dropped  to  units petrominerales shares led the increases with a rise of  to   while the valorem share closed with the greatest drop registering a negative variation of  to   while pacific fell  to   ecopetrols share closed at   up  opinions diego usme equity analyst  ultraburstiles although the new finding will not have a relevant impact on the stock we must wait to see if they are successful in new explorations sebastian gallego equity analyst  corredores asociados if the dividend is distributed in a single installment that would generate an upside for the stock in the short term although afterwards the selling flow would returnan assembly of ecopetrol full of edges the assembly has as a backdrop the bad moment of the action and the uncertainty over world crude prices half a million colombians are awaiting what happens this morning during the assembly of ecopetrol the most important company in colombia one of transcendental economic events not only for the stock market but for the entire colombian economy the figures speak for themselves of the   billion that fill the national budget about   billion are contributed by the joint venture and the market capitalization in the stock market  corresponds to the value paper of the oil company by far it is not only a leading company in the economy but the thermometer of what is happening in our country and if it is the thermometer lets look at what is happening ecopetrols stock is trading below   to   and its trend has not been very good the international price of oil in the wti and brent categories which are the ones by which the oil company is governed does not rise above us   and us   respectively generating a not very optimistic international environment due to the slowdown countries like china brazil and india and the severe recession that is becoming chronic in the european union as a preamble to thursdays assembly the colombian joint venture announced that it found a well near puerto gaitan that will put  barrels a day into its production at a site called pastinaca that production is not relevant for a country that must be sustained at more than one million barrels a day in order to truly be a big player in hydrocarbons the other point to assess is the lawsuit that ecopetrol recently won against pacific rubiales that although there is no peremptory order for it to be paid immediately it is a decision that generates jurisprudence and sets clear rules of the game for multinationals that they have exploration and exploitation businesses with the mixed but the most crucial point that must be analyzed by shareholders is when the national government will remove the other tranche of shares from the oil company to sell them on the stock exchanges a decision that will reorder the company and the market it is vital that ecopetrols senior management is clear in presenting its investment plan and analyzing current legal risks regarding the first point we must continue to suggest to the new board of directors that the company must go from being a public law firm with drills to a worldclass oil company which can live on the profitability of its knowhow and not of the bureaucratic administration of a scarce resource in a country that has oil but that the mining and energy policy has not allowed it to be an oil company ecopetrol is a vital company for the economy and is called upon to do great thingsoil finding gives a break to ecopetrols action at the end of the day ecopetrol registered the highest volume of negotiation with   million which generates a respite for the action since it had a positive variation of  despite the fact that it was expected that the discovery of the oil well would give a much higher result the capitalization index of the

purchases to the national hydrocarbons agency   billion for income tax and other items and   billion for global tax equity grew  compared to  and amounted to   billionon april  ecopetrol will pay a single installment of the dividend at ecopetrols general shareholders meeting one of the major questions the market had was clarified after the amount of the dividend to be distributed was defined the oil company decided that the payment will be made on april  in a single installment for minority shareholders a fact that will benefit the companys behavior on the stock market as in previous years the partners of the oil company will receive payment in the accounts that they have registered with their stock brokers although the initial proposal made by the firm was the payment in six installments federico renjifo minister of mines and energy assured that the government supported the distribution in a single payment for minority partners in the month of april and in six stages for the nation it should not be forgotten that the dividend of   for each share meets an ordinary distribution of   and an extraordinary one of   in this way the company will allocate  of its profits for this compensation which represents   billion another important fact is that minorities will receive  of the total while the government will be given  according to the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez pemberthy this is the most profitable dividend in the market the remuneration that we are distributing has the best profitability with respect to the share price in colombia  the same as what happened last year however this assertion was disputed by market analysts who assured that other firms such as petrominerales or corficolombiana have a higher yield compared to their share price the decision to pay in one installment was already discounted by the market which led to the closing of the stock on wednesday with an increase in its price compared to the drop it had presented in previous sessions the situation in the behavior of the action was repeated yesterday according to diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles the payment in a single installment generated a great buyer appetite throughout the day during the day a lot of interest was observed in the volumes of buyers and that has led to the action above   this is because the payment of the dividend in a single installment makes the return for the shareholders very interesting  in addition it is important to note that analysts expect the upward trend in the stock to continue in the next few days as stated by sebastian gallego equity analyst at corredores asociados who stated that throughout the day we could see appreciations for above  simply due to the expectation of the decision that the assembly would make once with the approval the stock is expected to maintain an upward trend  with this point clear many shareholders are considering the possibilities of use for the money they will receive from the dividend in this sense as stated by analysts it is recommended to maintain a conservative position this is stated by juan david ballen fixed income analyst at alianza valores stating that the best thing is to take conservative positions and invest in stocks that have little volatility such as corficolombiana or grupo avals preferred furthermore we are recommending investments in fixed income such as cdt  likewise usme assured that the investment depends on the profile of the people and how representative the investment flow can be the option of reinvesting in the company should be analyzed by each shareholder taking into account whether there is solidity how the company is growing and how the oil sector is doing at the moment on the other hand the partners of the oil company approved the members of the board of directors the members will be the minister of mines and energy federico renjifo velez the minister of finance and public credit mauricio cardenas santamaria and the national planning director mauricio santamaria salamanca who will act as government representatives likewise jorge gabino pinzon fabio echeverri correa joaquin moreno uribe luis carlos villegas

best year in profits as stated by federico rengifo and javier gutierrez ecopetrol showed its second best year in profits in  registering a net figure of   billion likewise the president of the company assured that assets reached   billion which will allow maintaining competitive corporate profitability in addition another of the points that generated the most interest in the assembly was the matter of the attacks carried out against the companys infrastructure for the transportation of crude oil on this issue the minister of mines and energy assured that although the attacks against ecopetrols facilities have increased in the first months of  compared to the same period of the previous year the companys production has not been affected currently the government has  men for their protectionecopetrols share is once again trading below   the beginning of the trading day has not been favorable for ecopetrol which is currently the share that falls the most in the colombian stock

different companies in particular we highlight the correction in ecopetrol which corresponds mainly to the adjustment due to the entry into the exdividend period also the announcement of previous operating results and exploratory update of prec generated an important movement during the day  the stock with the highest trading volume was ecopetrol with   million pacific rubiales with   and grupo exito with   million also stood out the colcap and  indices were located on mixed terrain the first lost  to  units and the second rose  to  units on the day   million were negotiated in

to the  average some shareholders of companies in the oil sector would be liquidating their positions in those companies to invest in pacific at this time pacifics title is a striking asset for buyers of shares in the sector because its margin of appreciation with respect to its fundamental value is higher compared to that of other oil companies such as ecopetrol said juan david ballen  analyst at alianza y valores in addition ballen pointed out that since the exdividend period of ecopetrols share began yesterday it is thought that people who leave one company could be buying assets in the other those who are selling ecopetrol would be moving to pacific because the assets are from the same sector and more attractive the volume of negotiation of the oil companies and the trigger for the exdividend allow us to think that he added pacific share on the rise according to diego usme an equity analyst at ultraburstiles the increase in pacifics share price was due to the rise in production in the first quarter of  reported by the company for  the oil company has its eyes set on  exploration wells in colombia and brazil one of which is already being drilled the overall success rate has been  since of these discoveries four have been significant in the oil issue and two in terms of condensed natural gas this added to the good news pacific received at the end of march regarding the approval of environmental permits to exploit the entire quifa sw field and part of the quifa norte block the exploration area around the rubiales field will strengthen the trend of increasing production and share value of the company in the short term the pacific stock is expected to continue to rise in value and the production results will allow a rebound in the stock after the final report which will be on may  the price per paper would reach   calculates ballen ecopetrols share down meanwhile ecopetrols share suffered a drop in its price the reason according to sebastian gallego an analyst at corredores asociados was the discount that the market makes to the value of the shares of the dividend paid to shareholders this discount is due according to diego usme to the fact that the stock entered the exdividend period in which people can sell them without worrying about the return since they will still receive it regarding the prospects for ecopetrols share usme indicated that after the exdividend period unless the company announces findings or advances in its business in other countries a fairly flat behavior is expected in the share price since there is not the same appetite in the market that there was in other years for the title of ecopetrol however there is talk of the possibility of ecopetrol entering spain which would undoubtedly have an impact on its share price according to the port authority of a coruna within its internationalization strategy the colombian oil company would be thinking of settling in the punta langosteira port in northwestern spain this is in order to establish a liquid bulk terminal there which would be added to those that repsol and pemex have there advances in oil exploration in the llanos orientales basin drilling in two wells revealed the presence of light crude oil and significant discoveries of gas condensate were made in the lower magdalena basin also the explorations raised expectations about a well in the catatumbo basin where they have found oil samples in addition to the wells discovered in colombia pacific rubiales is conducting  studies to obtain seismic data offshore peru opinions diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles the fall in the price of ecopetrols share is due to the fact that it entered the exdividend period when people can sell quietly because they will still receive the dividend juan david ballen equity analyst alianza y valores there is a rotation of assets thanks to the higher margin of appreciation of the pacific rubiales share with respect to its fundamental valuethe exdividend period continues to affect ecopetrol much volatility was seen yesterday in the negotiations of the colombian stock exchange driven by three titles ecopetrol pacific and davivienda the share of the state oil company continued to show a downward behavior yesterday registering a new fall of  to close at   which adds to the loss of more than  that was seen on the day of tuesday the analysts explained that this is a natural behavior on paper taking into account that the exdividend period began yesterday so that several investors who handle a dividend strategy with ecopetrol went out to liquidate their positions in this asset although experts project that the drop in price will continue to be seen for a few more sessions they predict that a new rise will soon be seen since the title is trading at low prices which generates interest among investors the director of economic research at alianza valores felipe campos said that the possibility of a rebound is based on the expectations that may begin to be generated with the first quarter earnings report which we think will be positive and also a very strong oversold of the current market  in turn pacific shares continued to perform well after the publication of the oil companys production data which marked figures that exceeded market expectations the paper closed yesterday with a new appreciation of  to

share has generated a return including dividends of more than   annually and has become part of the top  of the worlds oil companies by market capitalization this performance is due to an excellent mixed administration which has managed to increase crude oil production by about  and reserves by more than  thus making colombia one of the  countries that produce more than one million of barrels per day in the world ecopetrol contributes about  of the national production financially the company today reports revenues and profits of   billion and   billion annually equivalent to growth compared to  of  and  respectively so what is currently happening with ecopetrols share the company has entered a stage of maturity and its growth rate has gone from being dynamic not sustainable to a more stable one the main reason the stock held higher was strong earnings growth despite being viewed by many as an expensive stock by valuation multiples between  and  the companys quarterly profits grew on average by  whereas today they no longer do so and remain stable regarding multiples compared to peer companies worldwide ecopetrols market cap  reserves indicator remains at  well above that registered by the worlds largest companies such as exxon  petrochina    and chevron  regarding crude oil production the growth cycle has also moderated the companys goal is to produce  million barrels per day by  which implies that annual production growth should average  much less than the  growth achieved since  in  the company produced  thousand bpd regarding the dividend despite being attractive and paying a yield of   above the interest rate it has not been enough to contain the stocks fall that being the case what are the expectations for the asset technically ecopetrols pattern reminds us of other bearish behaviors where a leading stock in the market such as pacific rubiales in  goes from being overestimated to underestimated this implies that just as irrational purchases occurred when the asset was overestimated identical sales will occur when it is underestimated in the long term the stock could establish a floor at   or   subscription price of the second share issue because if profits and its distribution policy remain stable the dividend yield would be attractive enough to be between  and  in the short term the results report for the first quarter of  which will be published at the end of april could be a positive element to contain the oversold and downtrend our estimates are quite acceptable profits would return to levels close to   trillion  yoy   q  q revenues would amount to   trillion   yoy   q  t second largest in history and production would reach a record level above  thousand barrels per day   y  y   q  t however this rally would be a selling opportunity for those who have not been able to do so from now on longterm bullish behavior will depend on the companys ability to generate reservestrm and ecopetrol futures lead derivatives although

that it owed corresponding to the quifa field following the ruling of the arbitration tribunal for the interpretation of the prices in the contract for said field federico restrepo pacifics vice president of strategic affairs said that with this announcement we want to ratify our unconditional willingness to strengthen good relations with our main partner ecopetrol and to contribute to the climate of understanding and conciliation that should reign in the country pacific rubiales requested a meeting with the state oil company in the next few days to define the crude delivery and withdrawal plans corresponding to said companypacific will pay  million barrels to ecopetrol the canadian oil company pacific rubiales announced that it will pay ecopetrol  barrels corresponding to the quifa field after the arbitration court ruled in favor of the state majority company for the interpretation of the high prices clause the company stated that after receiving the collection account from ecopetrol it was decided to proceed with the payment of crude oil and for this they requested a meeting in the coming days to define delivery plans federico restrepo vice president of strategic affairs of pacific rubiales said that with this announcement we want to ratify our unconditional willingness to strengthen good relations with our main partner ecopetrol and to contribute to the climate of understanding and conciliation of the country the payment of  barrels that pacific rubiales will make to ecopetrol correspond to the high prices clause of the years  and  according to the courts ruling the valid interpretation of payment is that of the local oil company which required that the canadian will cancel a higher proportion of production when crude prices are high and a production of  million barrels is reached in the field the quifa block will be the canadian oil companys main asset as of  the company is currently implementing its star pilot project with which it is expected to double crude oil production from  barrels of hydrocarbon per day to more than  currently the participation in this oil block is  for pacific rubiales the canadian company had announced appeals against the decision had even filed an appeal for annulment of the award however for alejandro reyes director of economic studies at ultraburstiles the decision to make the payment would correspond among other issues to the extension of the rubiales field license yesterday there was a debate in congress for the extension of the rubiales field that was postponed probably that measure of the payment is part of the political lobby for trying to keep this field since at this moment the contract is until  he said  for his part hernando barrero president of the national association of petroleum engineers highlighted the decision and said that in the long term it leads us to think that the situations that arise are handled in the most appropriate way possible and the relationships between companies of the sector do not have any impact analysts point out that pacific rubiales will have to withdraw a large amount of money to make the payment to ecopetrol which will affect its cash flow and because the company is expanding through the purchase of companies such once this process may have a slowdown canadian expects record production volume pacific rubiales expects to report record production volumes in the first quarter of the year with production at the upper limit of the range of expectations for  the oil company noted that exploration well activity for the year

decreases were pfvillas with a negative variation of  and enka with a negative variation of ecopetrol strengthened the hiring of labor during the first quarter the first quarter of the year was not only positive due to the decisions made in the ecopetrol assemblies it was also positive because a total of  jobs were generated in different works and projects that the company develops in the country of this group of  jobs that were created  were local labor and  more correspond to personnel from other regions the generation of employment translates into improving peoples quality of life and is part of the companys social commitment the magdalena medio region generated the highest number of occupations with a total of  of which  correspond to local labor very close to the magdalena

beginning to show yesterday it was learned that the state oil company ecopetrol also improved its rating going from bbb to bbb which means good news for the company the reason for the best rating for the oil company has to do with the close relationship between it and the government since it should be clarified that ecopetrol is a majority state company which is why an increase in the colombian rating should be reflected in this company although it is not entirely owned by the government we have reviewed in our study the relationship between the company and the government because we believe that this property will remain stable in the coming years says the report from the rating agency the equity analyst of ultraburstiles diego usme explained that there are some companies with greater weight and relationship with the colombian rating standard  poors decision maintains the investment grade of the company and that is positive for the firm  despite this announcement the stock of the oil company maintained its downward trend and closed in the market with a negative variation of  at a value of   ecopetrol continues to be investment grade above bbb so investors did not make strong decisions it would have been different if it went from junk investment to investment grade says usme another of the effects of the bbb in colombia was seen in the behavior of the dollar during the day the currency lost   between its trading average of   and the representative market rate of   the impact is the result of lower aversion to risk so safe haven assets such as the dollar are no longer in high demand and depreciate the minimum rate reached was   and the maximum was   for carlos castaneda currency analyst at asesores en valores it must be recognized that the effect was not so marked this time because when the investment grade occurred the effect was much greater we expect the downward trend to continue but we do not believe it will be so marked  another of the announcements made by standard  poors yesterday was the review of the outlook of its counterpart credit ratings of bancolombia and banco de bogota and their corresponding subsidiaries from positive to stable according to the rating agency this decision follows the review of the outlook and the confirmation of the longterm sovereign rating in local currency of the republic of colombia at the same time it confirmed the longterm bbb and shortterm  counterparty credit ratings of these banks after these movements analysts expect the return of normality and a pause in the impacts on the market the local currency is not so attractive according to the standard  poors report colombia has an active debt market in local currency a flexible exchange rate and an increasingly reliable monetary policy trajectory however its local currency is not widely used in international markets therefore based on our rating methodology we assign a difference of one level notch between our longterm sovereign ratings in local and foreign currency  this then would be the great challenge for the local economy the opinion diego usme ultraburstiles equity analyst ecopetrols note increase does not have a great effect on the stock because it maintains the investment grade that is the attractiveness of the marketecopetrol buys bps stake in the discovery of the gulf of mexico ecopetrol reported that its subsidiary ecopetrol america inc bought bps stake in the gunflint discovery in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico offshore louisiana united states according to the company this acquisition is expected to contribute to its strategy to reach a production level of one million clean barrels of oil equivalent per day in  the discovery which took place in october  is localized within the extended area of the mississippi canyon at a depth of  meters ecopetrol america inc has a  interest in the gunflint discovery and the operator is noble energy inc the other partners are marathon oil company and samson offshore llcecopetrol looks north and calle  for its headquarters almost four years have passed since ecopetrol began searching for a place to build a new headquarters that would bring together the offices it currently has distributed in six different buildings in bogota the four located in front of the national park the san martin building on carrera septima with  and the rincon de la cabrera building in carrera    according to industry experts the multiple headquarters of the most important company in the country generate cost overruns and inefficiency this due to the fact that the time that an official must take to move from one building to another is at least ten minutes and for the headquarters located in la cabrera the value of a taxi can amount to   according to sergio mutis caballero president of inmobiliaria valor sa the division of the company into so many locations does not allow operations to be centralized and furthermore the buildings have become obsolete compared to the needs of the firm since they are not aligned the profits recorded at the work sites  despite this and although it has been known that the company has received proposals from different construction companies and that it has evaluated several megaprojects the oil companys headquarters are still in the same place according to information provided by ecopetrol at the beginning of this year a market survey was carried out to find out the different options that the company would have to define a possible new corporate headquarters in bogota at this moment an internal team is consolidating the information and defining possible scenarios to pass to the internal approval instances of the project for this reason there is still no hiring process or the corresponding authorizations said company spokesmen faced with this scenario the oil company would have started a negotiation process to settle in the calle  business center carrera septima with calle  but finally decided not to rent it according to karen castillo consultant for jones lang lasalle we heard that they were looking at options in the new building on calle  and sometime on paralelo  but we dont know what the negotiations resulted in apparently now they are looking for a custom building but we do not know what their final decision will be said castillo however the north of the capital would not be the only area that the oil company is studying as experts from the sector also affirmed that the company is looking at three lots on the outskirts of bogota for which they would decide between local investment funds to build a custom building sources close to the oil company who asked not to be identified say that one of those three options would be the operations and logistics zone zol in funza a project carried out by the terranum firm however the construction company was contacted by lr and did not provide details on the matter according to mutis caballero the companys interest in the salitre and el dorado avenue sectors has also been discussed due to its proximity to the airport and ease of mobility a statement supported by andres arango president of the construction company ospinas who added that this area also offers proximity to several restaurants the can and hotels however according to this manager the most important thing ecopetrol must take into account when making its decision is where the majority of its employees live and thus choose the option that best suits everyone a final alternative recommended by experts is that so that the area of the national park to which ecopetrol has given life with its permanence is not vacated the company could carry out an urban renewal project that brings together the buildings it currently has and other neighboring ones adapting them to their needs as a business citadel since this area is close to the airport and access roads such as carrera septima and calle  the price would be another determining factor the experts stated that it should be taken into account that when ecopetrol began the search for its headquarters the sale price of one square meter was   million while today it can go up to   million therefore a headquarters on the outskirts of bogota would be quite attractive since the north and west of the capital have a higher price however industry sources also stated that the latter would be more valued opinions andres arango president of ospinas a headquarters that unifies all ecopetrol offices should be located at  because it is a corporate hub which offers mobility benefits to workers sergio mutis caballero president of the real estate agency valor sa the ecopetrol headquarters have become inefficient due to cost overruns and obsolete due to the fact that some buildings have firstrate offices and others are very old jose belfort mattos executive director of cushman  wakefield for colombia and peru according to our latest market study there is today an availability of  square meters of class a offices in salitre and an increase of more than  is expected for president of ecopetrol among the most powerful in the world two colombians were included in the list of the  most powerful people on the planet published by foreign policy magazine among them the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez and the minister of defense juan carlos pinzon the idea of identifying the  most powerful people on the planet is a tool provided by the magazine to create an inventory of the most important leaders in sectors from politics to high finance from the media to energy and from the war on religion to determine the list the magazine compares several rankings including the  most powerful of forbes gutierrez a civil engineer from the universidad de los andes and a masters degree in industrial engineering from the same university is considered one of the best managers in the business world among his most outstanding tasks are to convert interconectado electrica sa isa into a multinational and to democratize ecopetrol for the experts the fact of being part of the  most important and influential personalities in the world not only makes gutierrez grow but also ecopetrol a company that since its inception has managed to consolidate itself as one of the most important in the country the case of juan carlos pinzon is a bit surprising says alvaro villarraga president of the democratic culture foundation according to him the reason why the minister appears on the list is due to the armed conflict in the country which makes him appear continuously in the media generating a lot of publicity pinzon minister of defense since august  is an economist from the javeriana university with a masters degree in public policy from the woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs at princeton university one of the most important achievements that he has had during the time he has served as the minister of defense was to have led the operations that killed alfonso cano one of the main leaders of the farc villarraga adds that it is very important that this type of recognition be given to colombian personalities however it would be much better if recognition were made to other values hopefully characters who are at the forefront of the war would not be recognized and if they were made with who are trying to achieve peace in the country  most important personalities the foreing policy magazine also highlighted among the most important and influential personalities personalities from the spiritual world such as jorge mario bergoglio pope of the catholic church the dalai lama spiritual guide of the tibetans the presidents francois hollande de france cristina fernandez de kirchner from argentina barack obama from the united states dilma rousseff from brazil to

that the organizations oil production rose in the first quarter of the year the companys net profit fell  going from   billion in the first quarter of  to   billion in the same period this year likewise the total sales of the main company in the country between january and march  were   billion  less than the   billion registered in the same period a year ago the oil companys ebitda was   billion between january and march  compared to   billion in the same period in  according to the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez pemberthy in the first quarter of  we highlight the growth of  production reaching a new record of almost  thousand barrels equivalent per day thanks to a significant increase in the main fields  however he highlighted that in terms of financial results we continue with competitive margins and returns despite lower sales prices which were partially offset by higher crude oil production and higher volumes soldecopetrols profits fell  during the first quarter of this year ecopetrol recorded   trillion in profits which represents a  drop compared to those recorded by the company in the first quarter of last year when they amounted to   trillion according to information from the company this drop in profits was due to lower sales prices which were offset by higher crude production and higher volumes sold that went from  barrels of crude oil equivalent per day in the first quarter from  to  barrels per day in the same period this year which represented an increase of  the companys sales in the published period also decreased since they went from   billion to   which meant a fall of  this situation arose due to the fall in international oil prices likewise at the beginning of this year there was a drop in the price of the crude export basket by  compared to the same period in  this trend was in line with the lower prices of the main international indicators while the benchmark brent crude fell  in the first quarter of the year the wti did so at  for its part operating profit for this first quarter was   trillion while in the same period last year it amounted to   trillion which represented a decrease of  ebitda also fell and it was recorded at   trillion while last year it was   trillion faced with these results javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol pointed out that the company continues with competitive margins and returns despite lower sales prices which were partially offset by higher crude oil production and higher volumes sold on the positive side during this first quarter the firm also reached a new production record of  barrels equivalent per day which represented an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year which brings the company closer to to the goal of producing  barrels per day this year the highest production originated in the chichimene fields which had an increase of  and went from  equivalent barrels per day to  in this first quarter of the year production in the castilla field on the other hand which is also operated by ecopetrol went from producing  barrels a day in the first quarter of  to  barrels per day in the same period of this year which meant an increase of    according to the company there were significant increases in production from the rubiales quifa and la cirainfantas fields where ecopetrol has a stake and progress

the progress of the modernization project of the barrancabermeja refinery was   at the end of the first quarter of  in the first quarter of  the average daily volume transported increased due to the increase in the transport of heavy crude through the pipelines the total volume transported of crude oil and products went from  million barrels per day to  million barrels per day regarding the execution of the works of the bicentennial pipeline of colombia obc progress until the end of march  was  the opinion javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol in exploration we made three discoveries in colombia two through ecopetrol and one through our subsidiary hocol at an international level we present offers in  blocks ecopetrols results would affect the bvc indices today although not all analysts were optimistic with the results that the colombian oil company ecopetrol could have the  decrease in its profits compared to the first quarter of  was surprising because it was not expected to be so high last week lr had carried out a survey on what they believed the companys sales and profits would be and the average had been   billion which is why the   million less it reported will have an important weight in the behavior of the markets today it should be remembered that ecopetrol is the main share of the stock indices and as has been seen in recent months a fall in this title affects the entire market according to jorge bello equity analyst for shares and securities in the future the behavior of ecopetrols share will be subject to the companys ability to add new reserves and extend their life in the medium term a fundamental drive for achieve the goals set in terms of production for   one of the most accurate forecasts was that of asesores en valores who had calculated the oil companys profit at   trillion we expect revenue for the first quarter of  of   billion compared to   billion in  regarding net income maintaining the margins of the fourth quarter of  we expect it to be around   trillions said omar escorcia equity analyst it should be remembered that although in the first quarter of  the average production reached  barrels per day with a growth of  compared to the average production of the first quarter of  operating income decreased  for now according to analysts the market will assimilate the results but then the increase in production that is in line with the ministrys production outlook will be valued some brokers maintain their recommendation to overweight the stock that is to have it in their portfolio above other assets so the outlook is not so negative regarding shareholders the decrease in profits represents   per share the ecopetrol title last friday may  closed at   which showed an increase of  and it was also the most traded share with  millions for now a negative but shortterm session can be expected as the other stocks are in good shape and could counteract bicentennial pipeline and cenit the stakes one of the big projects ecopetrol is targeting for this year is the completion of the bicentennial pipeline according to the companys report as of march  the general progress in the execution of the project was  and it is planned to start the filling process of the araguaney  banadia pipeline in the second quarter of  likewise on  in april the contribution of assets related to the hydrocarbon

the stocks that had the greatest decrease in the day was ecopetrol with a negative variation of  to   for the ultraburstiles analyst diego usme todays decline is due to the interpretation of ecopetrols results which despite showing an evolution and progress in production there is an effect on the basket of products sold that generated a setback in terms of financial results  the pacific rubiales share was one of the ones that stood out the most on the day with a change in its price of  to   proenergia was the share that achieved the most important rise during the session this title

ecopetrols financial results for the first quarter which were presented last friday and were  below average expectations took the toll on the share which yesterday it was quoted at a minimum of   the price at which the title was negotiated in october  with the fall the role of the oil company reached the lowest in recent years and accumulated a drop so far in  of more than  equivalent to   as expected the trading day started in the red for the ecopetrol share which started trading with a drop of more than  at which point it hit the trading lows as the hours passed it had a slight recovery to finally close with a decrease of  to   according to analysts this behavior in the red could continue for several sessions and lead the stock to break the   floor this is how valeria marconi senior analyst of credicorp capital shares considers it who explained that the market gave a quite negative response because the expectations for the quarterly results were above what the company finally registered a fact that clearly opens a possibility for the stock to lose   in the next few days  this opinion is shared by juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores who made it clear that the panic and oversold of the stock could continue this week the results were  lower than expected so there is the possibility that the asset will fall below   in the short term so it is vital that the company maintain its profits this quarter so that the stock do not continue to be punished  despite this not all analysts share the idea that the stock will continue to decline according to diego usme although there was high sales sentiment on the day ecopetrol has levels of   and   that function as technical supports which some investors see as an attractive point to buy but although the market received the results negatively analysts assure that not everything was bad in the quarterly report since there was a significant rebound in production data so it is expected that the stock may have a positive reaction in the long term and improve the prospects for the company for jorge bello analyst of shares in actions and securities the fact that production has reached  barrels per day very close to the  barrels per day goal that was set for  is a mitigating factor that is positive and could favor the appreciation of the stock and leaves an open door for better performance in the future even so as the analyst added ecopetrol has shown that it has difficulties in improving its financial and cost structure in addition the replacement for reserves is practically  to  and the life of these assets is only  years so the performance of the oil company will be marked by the accounts of the second quarter as well as by the success they have in their exploration and discovery programs  with this the oil company ecopetrol faces great challenges for the next few months so analysts only recommend investors to be patient with the title since this is not the time to sell but it is better to wait for a recovery in the long term pension funds the most affected with this bad moment that the company is suffering in the stock market which has led it to present large losses in its market capitalization reaching over   billion in the quarter it is clear that with the exception of the state which is the main shareholder the institutions that are most affected by these losses are the pension funds whose investment portfolios have a high exposure to the oil companys securities which makes them the most sensitive to losses opinions juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores these results negatively surprised the market which expected on average that the profit would amount to   billion  above what was finally reported jorge bello equity and securities equity analyst the results show two readings on the one hand its difficulty in financial and cost terms but it also has a positive side since its production data are positivethe comptrollers office tells ecopetrol that there would be a loss of us   million per award the office of the comptroller general of the republic cgr issued an alert about a possible fiscal detriment of us   million after the arbitration award for the quifa association contract between the oil companies ecopetrol and pacific rubiales that lawsuit which was resolved by the bogota chamber of commerce ended in favor of the state oil company and it was established that pacific must pay it about  million barrels the cgr sent a letter to the president of the state company javier gutierrez making this warning and saying that the price conditions that existed between  and  must be taken into account as published by the control body the risk of detriment is given by the settlement of the  million barrels that pacific rubiales owes to ecopetrol these must be corrected to the wti or brent value of the periods in which said shortages were generated and adjusted according to the factors indicated in this warning function said the cgr according to the comptrollers calculations it is estimated that the volume generated between april  and march  has a value adjusted for dollar inflation and without a penalty for crude oil quality or discounts for transportation and commercialization of us   million this figure is relatively less than the us   million that should be canceled with the current value of oil and that difference is the one that worries the comptroller sandra morelli who says that the fiscal detriment would arise since the resources that ecopetrol has stopped receiving which are from the nation would generate this panorama of losses it should be noted that since  the state oil company migrated to the brent price system which is priced on average us   more than the wti therefore the calculations must adjust to those conditions as well so far ecopetrol has already sent the collection invoice to the private oil company and this is about to be canceledthe comptrollers office tells

arbitration award for the quifa association contract between the oil companies ecopetrol and pacific rubiales that lawsuit which was resolved by the bogota chamber of commerce ended in favor of the state oil company and it was established that pacific must pay it about  million barrels the cgr sent a letter to the president of the state company javier gutierrez making this warning and saying that the price conditions that existed between  and  must be taken into account as published by the control body the risk of detriment is given by the settlement of the  million barrels that pacific rubiales owes to ecopetrol these must be corrected to the wti or brent value of the periods in which said shortages were generated and adjusted according to the factors indicated in this warning function said the cgr according to the comptrollers calculations it is estimated that the volume generated between april  and march  has a value adjusted for dollar inflation and without a penalty for crude oil quality or discounts for transportation and commercialization of us   million this figure is relatively less than the us   million that should be canceled with the current value of oil and that difference is the one that worries the comptroller sandra morelli who says that the fiscal detriment would arise since the resources that ecopetrol has stopped receiving which are from the nation would generate this panorama of losses it should be noted that since  the state oil company migrated to the brent price system which is priced on average us   more than the wti therefore the calculations must adjust to those conditions as well so far ecopetrol has already sent the collection invoice to the private oil company and this is about to be canceledecopetrol reficar and avianca

government of that country went out to auction areas in which there is prospectivity for the development of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities the main company in the country ecopetrol was the winner of two oil blocks in that country the blocks are  and  both of which will be  owned by the state oil companyecopetrol was left with three oil blocks for auction in brazil the main company in the country in terms of billing ecopetrol presented the best offers to keep three of the  blocks that the brazilian government put up for tender through the national petroleum agency anp for the exploitation and exploration of hydrocarbons  it should be mentioned that this round is at stake and that it will end today which means that it is likely according to information from the same oil company that ecopetrol will keep other blocks the truth is that at the end of this edition the firm had already been left with an offshore block possibly containing oil and natural gas in the potiguar basin in northern brazil ecopetrol paid the anp about us   million to be awarded the  area geological experts estimate that this area located to the southeast of the city of fortaleza is highly prospective currently the potiguar basin is being drilled by petrobras brazils main oil company which focuses its production on natural gas which is extracted from waters that are not very deep the colombian company also won the tender to explore the  block in bahia do foz do amazonas according to the official anp report ecopetrol paid almost us   million for the development of its operations in that place the block is also located off the coast of the neighboring country another of the areas that ecopetrol took in the brazil round was achieved in association with an old acquaintance with whom it is currently working in the country the state oil company together with chevron will pay more than us   million to explore the bahia do foz do amazonas in block  the two companies will search for hydrocarbons on off shore platforms located off the coast of the neighboring country at the end of this note ecopetrol had three blocks assigned and it is possible that since the oil round is underway the company has been left with others petrominerales won  blocks the canadianowned company petrominerales which has assets in the national territory also presented two offers to acquire blocks in the brazil round through the subsidiary alvopetro the canadian company tendered and took the  and  zones in basins located on the continental shelf brazil increasingly interesting brazil has not opened an oil round for more than five years but this time it put out to tender  blocks with which it aroused the interest of the most important players in the industry worldwide the auction being held is awarding exploration and production licenses located inland and offshore as it was known the blocks that are located in the sea in front of the state of rio de janeiro where brazil produces most of its oil would contain reserves of more than  million barrels of oil a figure with the one that would cover the global demand for crude oil for a whole year according to expertsecopetrol is ready to conquer brazil the main company in the country ecopetrol continues to bet on the development of its operations in brazil after the oil round held on may  and  in that country the oil company won  blocks in reports from the national petroleum agency anp the company was awarded those exploration areas after submitting the best offers ecopetrol oleo e gas do brasil a subsidiary of the state oil company will manage blocks  and  in which the rights are  owned for the first the company will pay the anp about us   million while for the other it will have to pay us   million the other area awarded to the company is  in which it presented a joint offer with chevron the participation of both organizations will be  the consortium will pay the brazilian state us   million the approximate size of the three blocks is  square kilometers and they are located in the offshore basins of potiguar foz de amazonas and ceara with these operations ecopetrol will strengthen its knowledge in operations of this typeecopetrol sees it feasible that colombia could produce  million barrels per day in  this was pointed out by the president of the colombian oil company javier gutierrez who said that this would lead the country to add  million barrels of reserves between  and  gutierrez sees this perspective as feasible taking into account that colombia today has been adding some  million barrels of average reserves a year but ensures that to sustain that figure and increase it the nation must maintain key conditions such as continuing to be attractive for national and international investors a competitive royalty structure have tax incentives carry out periodic rounds an institutional framework and have an agile environmental and transport infrastructure licensing scheme among others we need more and more players to arrive with different characteristics who have different ideas and who can really generate a more competitive environment he said at the ix international mining and oil congress that ends this friday in cartagena gutierrez emphasizes that to have a production of  million barrels of oil equivalent per day in  it implies growing production to  million per year and adding some  million barrels in the period in those  years he says that if the nation maintains a production rate of  million a day including gas it would need to add  billion in that period where can these resources come from gutierrez explained that there are four basic sources the increase in the recovery factor from  to  the drilling done in the existing fields and two new ones that are unconventional hydrocarbons and offshore exploration in the sea it is shown that colombia between  and  had  discoveries that is  per year of those  were between  and  million barrels  between  and  million and only  would be between  and  billion barrels between  and  the country had  discoveries that is a train of small discoveries has been maintained that has allowed  producing companies to maintain the rhythm of production and reserves it is not ruled out that discoveries will appear located in that   he said in summary gutierrez indicated a scenario is being raised in which the country has been adding  million barrels per year and would require  million reserves that is adding  million to what is today which according to what has been worked out is possible for gutierrez  to reach a production of  million a day in  years it is perfectly possible to have a sustainable path and not continue to have the doubts that we usually express and to generate confidence to continue marking the development of the sector he concluded clear rules humberto calderon president of vetra group believes that colombia can indeed take production to  million barrels you have to make a tremendous effort in the public and private sectors and what governments must do is provide clear rules of the game legal security and that happens in colombia he said however he added that there are factors to be corrected such as those related to the infrastructure issue felipe marquez vp  general counsel of anglogold ashanti said that reports such as the one revealed by the comptroller general of the nation sandra morelli in which he proposes modifying the extractive model in the country has a political sense that seeks to change an already established structure  an unfounded sector is attacked that is harmful to the message that the country wants to give to international investors he saidecopetrol is capable of taking over the rubiales field gutierrez operating a field like rubiales is the same as castilla y chichimene and their productions are similar but it is clear that there are areas in which ecopetrol still has much to learn such as offshore and unconventional operations we can operate the rubiales field and from being with them pacific rubiales we have also learned and with the other partners  he said rubiales is the largest crude producing field in the country luis pacheco senior executive vpplanning and ait of pacific rubiales said that the objective of the firm is to generate value and in that sense the interest is always to remain associated with ecopetrol we have a contract until  and we are working under that premise and trying to find a way to add more value together we remain partners in other businesses we believe that there may be a case of adding more value to the nation by staying in the rubiales field however it is a sovereign decision for the country he said indicating that pacifics interest is to remain in the rubiales field we will continue to be ecopetrols partners no matter what happens in the rubiales fieldecopetrol is capable of taking over the rubiales field gutierrez although there are three years to go until the association contract that ecopetrol has with the pacific rubiales firm expires in the operation of the rubiales field and at the request of senators that the stateowned company assume its control the president of the colombian oil company javier gutierrez he pointed out that the firm is capable of handling rubiales this is in response to indications that indicate that the company would not be able to take on said operation if the association with pacific is not renewed operating a field like rubiales is the same as castilla y chichimene and their productions are similar but it is clear that there are areas in which ecopetrol still has a lot to learn such as offshore at sea and unconventional operations ecopetrol has a lot to learn and i am the first to recognize it we have shown that we can face challenges but clearly it will not be the factor of ecopetrols inability that will limit us to receive if it were like this at the time the rubiales field or any other we can operate it and from being associated with them pacific rubiales we have learned as well as with the other partners he said rubiales is the largest crude producing field in the country luis pacheco senior executive vp planning and ait of pacific rubiales said that the objective of the firm is to generate value and in that sense the interest is always to remain associated with ecopetrol we have a contract until  and we are working under that premise and trying to find a way to add more value together we continue to be partners with ecopetrol in other businesses we believe that there may be a case of adding more value to the nation by staying in campo rubiales however it is a sovereign decision for the country he said indicating that pacifics interest is to remain in the rubiales field we will continue to be ecopetrols partners no matter what happens with rubiales he said the executive ruled out in case the contract with ecopetrol is not renewed that pacific leaves the country since the company has more than  wells both executives were on thursday in a panel in development of the ix international congress of mining and petroleum which ends today in cartagenathe continued award of patents gives ecopetrol a new competitive advantage in addition to being the first company in profits with   billion registered during  ecopetrol was awarded  patents that certify its own inventions of which  are in colombia  in mexico and  in russia becoming the colombian company that most patent applications filed and obtained during that year this means that with this right the patent holder in this case ecopetrol is the only one who can make use of said technology and can prevent third parties from using the tools developed and registered as their own or authorize them to implement them under the conditions you set thus the company has registered six new patents this year in peru the united states mexico and colombia both for processes and tools and plans to file  new applications for different technologies at the international level the company has a total of  patents registered in brazil ecuador venezuela nigeria the united states mexico peru and russia for industry experts this constant award of new patents provides the company with a new competitive advantage as it shows the permanent innovation process that the firm is going through according to german corredor director of the national university energy observatory any technological development that is an invention of a company means a profit for it this is due not only to the fact that the firm obtains the exclusivity of its inventions through patents and can make the decision to allow others to use them but it also allows the company to invest in technological developments to improve its operation pedro nel benjumea vicerector of the faculty of mines of the national university pointed out that the reason why ecopetrol has so many patents is that it has a very strong investigative arm which is the colombian petroleum institute benjumea added that these developments help to strengthen another arm of the company which is technology and allows it to offer support services to implement inventions alvaro yunes president of the national federation of fuel and energy distributors fendipetroleo nacional stressed that thanks to the patented developments ecopetrol is at the forefront of technology in the national industry which represents both a benefit for the company and for the country however yunes also stated that it is necessary for the company to allow these technologies to be widely used at the national level so that both the quality of the local hydrocarbon sector and the application of those tools and processes are improved among the patents that have been obtained this year by ecopetrol there are two processes that allow reducing environmental impacts caused by the extraction of crude oil thus the combined system for the removal of organic phenols and the reduction of the toxicity of wastewater and the process for the treatment of spent soda and the product obtained in the same process reduce water pollution and allow to recover and convert into valuable products compounds that in other circumstances generate high toxicity respectively according to corredor it is even more important for the industry that ecopetrol develop inventions to mitigate the environmental years caused by its activity since the ecological issue is a fundamental point within the oil sector in addition the academic explained that this has a positive influence on the company as it will surely have a greater incidence unlike other companies in the sector in crude exploration and production contracts the most representative creations of the oil company according to information from the oil company the most representative patents are the dosing equipment and procedure for plugging derivations in fluid transport pipelines which was registered in russia and is valid until  the process for the treatment of heavy and extraheavy crude at the wellhead to improve their transportation conditions registered in mexico and the united states and whose validity expires in  and  and the intelligent tool for detection of perforations and interpretation of data online approved in mexico and valid for  years which will expire on june   opinions german corredor director of the energy observatory of the university national technological advances in environmental issues for companies in the oil industry is a key issue for this reason patents of this type help the company in contracts  pedro nel benjumea vicerector of the national universitys mining faculty patents allow ecopetrol to add sales for their use and develop other services in the technological aspect which adds another arm for the companyattack on the ecopetrol pipeline in putumayo caused environmental damage ecopetrol continues to add attacks to its transportation systems yesterday there was an attack against the san miguelorito pipeline in the putumayo department which left one person injured a significant amount of crude oil affected water sources in the orito region for which the company reported in a statement that a contingency plan was launched ecopetrol suspended pumping through this transmission line and informed the regional autonomous corporation of putumayo corpoamazonia as well as the local committee for disaster risk management of the municipality of orito so that in a coordinated work they can restore normality in the area  the text specified as a result of this attack a fire also broke out that was controlled by firefighters from orito and la hormiga valle del guamuez the army indicated that it will guarantee the safety of the affected sector so that ecopetrol technicians can enter the area to verify the magnitude of the damage and begin repair work on this pipeline according to luis alvaro pardo director of colombia punto medio the consequences of this spill cannot be known until the company determines the damage caused by the attack on the pipeline until february of this year there were  attacks that the firm had registered according to information released by its president javier gutierrez pemberthy during the general assembly of shareholders the manager also assured that the company had to invest   million to protect the infrastructure the national government also ordered  men for their protection the minister of mines and energy federico renjifo pointed out at that time that although the attacks against the oil companys facilities had increased in the first months of  compared to the same period last year the companys production had not been affected the company stops producing  barrels of crude per day due to these attacks the opinion javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol due to these attacks against our transportation system the company had to allocate   million to protect the infrastructureecopetrol shares hit a minimum of   red day for ecopetrol shares the titles of the colombian oil company reached minimums of   a level that had not touched since november  the title of the main company on the stock market closed at   which means that it broke the floor of   the situation of the oil company with its peers seems to be complicated and that is why the market is punishing the title at this value the stock falls about  for its part tablemac achieved the most important rise with a growth of  closing at   the species with the highest trading volume was cementos argos pfcemargos with   million as for the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange colcap it closed at  units with a decrease of  the  liquidity index and the igbc also decreased with  and  respectivelyecopetrol stock closed below   yesterday ecopetrols stock is definitely not going through its best moment after chaining during the last weeks several days closing in negative territory little by little it was approaching the level of   a price that after yesterdays fall it finally exceeded in the session the oil company was the most punished of the day registering a  drop in its titles for which it left its price at the end of the day at   this places the price of the companys shares at a level that had not been seen since november   the bad behavior occurred despite the fact that there were no specific news on the day to explain a negative behavior of the stock as maria adelaida velazquez serfincos equity analyst explained the last known about the company were the blocks awarded in brazil but the fact that not much is known about them yet means that there are no additional aspects that explain the fall this is why as jose dario lozano head of actions at alianza valores considers that the behavior is due to the trend that the action follows the fall that was seen in the paper attends to the trend that has presented in recent weeks where the titles of the oil company have presented a downward correction adjusting to the correct value that the market gives to the company which according to our estimates it is between   and    according to the analyst the current environment that the company is going through in terms of the level of reserves the companys production and margins it presented do not justify a price above   in this sense velazquez assured that until there is some positive information about ecopetrol a change in the downward trend of the oil company would not be expected an important aspect to highlight is that contrary to what usually happens in the local stock market where ecopetrol is usually the one with the highest trading volume on the day it was relegated to second place with a total figure of   million while that the one that moved the most in the market was cementos argos preferred share the most traded share with a volume of   million behind ecopetrol another company that did not register a good day was isa which fell  leaving its securities at   for its part celsia also recorded losses during the day since its share had a decrease of  to   in each of its papers on the positive side tablemac was the most valued of the session rising  to a price of   each share behind grupo exito had one more day on the rise gaining  so the share price was   finally construcciones el condor rose  to finish at   regarding the local market indicators all three closed negatively the general index of the colombian stock market igbc closed the day at  to end at  units while the colcap had a similar fall from  to  integers finally the  indicator was the least punished losing  to  points the oil company has several fronts that can impact as analysts say added to the fact that more information is known about the wells awarded in brazil at the oil congress that was held in cartagena several possible fronts that could have great influence on the action one of these is that the possibility of ecopetrol retaking control of the rubiales field was mentioned even so little is currently known about the matter so more news will have to be expected the opinions jose dario lozano head of shares of alianza valores the environment that ecopetrol is currently going through in terms of its level of reserves and margins does not justify a price above   and the market adjusts to thatecopetrol share returned to   at the close of the market ecopetrols stock had a slight recovery and rose  to   after having fallen  in the middle of the day the title was the one with the highest trading volume today

recommendations so far this year ecopetrols share has fallen  which corresponds to the most significant decrease that the stock markets star title has had since its issuance in  this behavior makes the thousands of shareholders who have from a minimal package to large amounts of money invested in the state oil company the impacts are felt by each one of the people either in the statement of their account with the stock broker in the returns of their collective portfolio or in the results of their voluntary and mandatory pension portfolio in order to give advice on what to do if you are worried about the loss of value of your investment it is necessary as stated by jorge bello analyst of stocks and securities to divide the shareholders into three groups so that you can analyze in which group is and thus make the best decision if you bought at   if you were one of the  people who bought ecopetrol shares at   in  and have held out until now it is because you are clear about two things first that your investment is longterm and second that the capital that he bet and rented him  that is his savings tripled something that does not usually happen with financial products in a period of only six years for these people the recommendation is to keep the title because without a doubt their profits are still high and if they sell now or tomorrow they have already increased the invested capital if you bought in the second issue the following case is that of those people who due to the success of the first issue were encouraged to make purchases in the second issue in  at a price of   for these the profitability has been  much lower than the   but has still won these people according to analysts should think about their risk profile and the time they have allocated to investing because if they evaluate the fundamentals of the company they could notice that the stock may rise again which would favor them the best thing is to keep looking at the fundamentals and evaluate what you need you must assume the loss and evaluate the risk profile and how long you have the investment for  says bello if you bought in the boom at   this is the most difficult case those people who with the upward trend that the stock had were motivated to buy at a price between   and   because at this moment they are having losses of more than  for them the best thing is to evaluate the options and see if it is possible to withstand the fall there are no significant promises that could reflect a rebound for the second semester which is why the stock falls explains diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles thus it must be taken into account that when one buys a share it is because he expects the company to give positive results but in this case there are many exogenous variables that mean that the results are not occurring the asesorias e inversiones stockbroker diego franco says that it is clear that levels of more than   were costly for the company the suggestion is to maintain because it is not a specific issue of ecopetrols action but of the entire market and this drop is due among other things to the issuance of cemargos the expectation of the issuance of bancolombia in addition to the exit of some funds due to the balance of their indices or portfolios for now the thousands of shareholders must assess their situation and seek advice from the experts awaiting the assigned blocks one of the news that the colombian oil company could give has to do with the details of the blocks awarded in brazil having a clear understanding of the capacity of said land and the production that could be positive would raise the price of the action also according to the recently published results there is the possibility that the company will reach the goal of  barrels which is undoubtedly also positive news for now according to market data the stock closed  higher at   opinions diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles at this moment there is no clear promise that the title can recover however the investor must see his risk profile and the time that he thinks to have the action  diego franco stockbroker of asesoria e inversiones the suggestion is to keep the title because it is not a specific issue of ecopetrols action but of the entire market which has been down due to issues such as cementos argosecopetrol and aguila are among the top  of the most valuable brands in the region behind a brand there is always a good story and usually also a strong company for the first time two colombian names ecopetrol and aguila managed to enter the top positions in the brandz categories a list made by the millward brown marketing agency which compiles the  most valuable brands in the world the annual report is made taking into account the operating income of  brands in more than  countries and combines this value with a survey of how much the brand is loved how unique the product is and how present it is in the minds of the customers consumers in the case of colombian companies ecopetrol managed to take the number seven position in latin america with a brand value of us   million  more than last year aguila for its part landed in tenth place with a valuation of us   million as for the first place in the region it was taken by the mexican beer corona with a value of us   million the other firms in the ranking included claro itau falabella and telcel in addition to entering the latin american list the two companies in the country also stood out in their sectors ecopetrol ranked ninth among the  most valuable oil and gas brands where it shares the ranking with companies such as exxon mobil shell and petrochina this category had a general devaluation of  of its joint value the report ensures that firms located in the bric countries are willing to change their practices to take care of the environment which will have a positive impact on their brands aguila which is promoted as the beer of colombians and is related to the countrys soccer team was ranked eighth among the most valuable beer brands in the world in this category it shares the mention with the latin names of brahma and corona while bud light took first place this list for its part increased in value  more than any other thanks to the good performance of several brands and an increase in global beer consumption of  aguila also took first place in brand contribution a category that measures how much a single brand helped the total value of names under a company in this case sabmiller according to the report colombian beer was the one that best managed to stand out and generate desire and loyalty among consumers brand analyst ricardo gaitan said when you think of aguila you think of watching football seeing falcao score goals and that creates an appreciation for the brand the two colombian companies entered the ranking even after the composite value of the top ten brands in the region fell  according to the report this drop was due to a less favorable performance by brazilian companies including petrobras which lost  in its brand value compared to last year and was affected by the governments economic policies dora forero general manager of naser publicidad assured that having a good brand is as important an asset as having a good product however he stressed that in many cases companies do not see the monetary value behind marketing and can lose competitiveness against their rivals if they do not have a positioning strategy finally gaitan stressed that it is unlikely that colombians will enter the list of the  most valuable brands in the world in the short term the reason for this is that they are products that do not stand out as unique and that also have a strategy focused on the country north america takes the bulk of brands almost half of the most valuable brands are located in north america according to the millward brown report brandz the top  most valuable global brands these firms are part of two thirds of the total value of the  brands that accumulate us   billion despite this large portion the valuation of brands in this region remained at the same level this year the first place was taken again by apple with us   million followed by google that stole the position returned to ibm with an increase of  and a value of us   million opinion ricardo gaitan brand analyst the objectives of a company are always to provide a service to a community fulfill a responsibility and generate wealth a good brand helps to achieve all this ecopetrol sells three fields that did not represent higher oil production the areas sold by ecopetrol correspond to the fields el dificil located in the lower magdalena valley basin as well as the entrerrios and guarimena fields located in los llanos in a statement the oil company reported that it closed the sale transaction of its stake in three minor fields to the company petroleos sud americanos sa petrosud for us   million the sale comes at a time when the stock has shown a downward behavior due to the few oil finds and financial results the transfer of the respective agreements was approved by the national hydrocarbons agency on may   says the report it is estimated that the three areas may have proven and probable reserves of  million barrels of oil equivalent that is the sum of crude oil and gasthe share that was most traded on

in this regard pacific rubiales with   million with a positive change in its price from  to   together with banco de bogota with   million and a positive change in its price of    at   the share that

of  to   there was also depreciation in the bvc with a negative variation of  to   and nutresa with a negative variation of  to   the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange closed at  units with an increase of  compared to the close of the previous daystarting in july ecopetrols sales abroad will increase crude oil transportation added to delays in environmental licenses and insecurity are the main bottlenecks of the oil industry in colombia the good news is that as of july  phase i of the bicentenario pipeline will come into operation which will increase transportation of up to  barrels per day from the eastern plains this was announced by enrique jose fuentes corporate cost chief of ecopetrol during his speech at the panel on how to sustain the boom in colombia at the xxii annual energy conference organized by the institute of the americas one of the biggest challenges is the transportation of crude through the colombian geography in this regard it should be noted that the bicentenario pipeline is already in the filling process and as of july  it will enter into operation with which it is expected to increase the transportation of crude oil in the area by  barrels per day explained fuentes the manager stated that with the entry into operation of this first phase ecopetrols exports will increase with which it is expected that the companys sales will recover since in the first quarter of this year despite having a higher production  the financial results were lower what we saw in the first quarter is that there was a growth in sales to the domestic market so the price was not the international one and was reflected in the results but with the entry of bicentennial we hope to increase exports he added ecopetrols corporate cost manager phase i of the bicentenario pipeline runs from araguaney to banadia has a length of  kilometers and the diameter of the pipeline in this section is  inches the araguaney station will have a pumping and storage capacity of  barrels per day while in the case of banadia the discharge will have a capacity of  barrels and a storage capacity of  barrels environmental licenses another challenge for the sector to maintain the dynamism achieved in the last decade and remain attractive to investors is the delays in the issuance of environmental licenses that are affecting its development experts on the subject such as john padilla ceo of the consulting firm ipd latin america affirmed that licenses are taking an average of one year a situation that is delaying the start and development of projects the consultant assured that the national environmental licensing authority anla has many environmental experts but they do not have the experience in hydrocarbons and our clients tell us that this delays the processes in this regard the deputy minister of energy orlando cabrales segovia acknowledged that it is true that there are delays in environmental licenses but in recent months the process has improved and we hope to soon reach the issuance goal in six months as the outlook in the short term is not encouraging businessmen have reacted and adjusted their plans to the new chronology of environmental procedures what ecopetrol is doing is working well in advance up to three years to ensure the timely approval of the licenses there is no doubt that this affected the production of the entire industry added fuentes ecopetrol and pacific rubiales suffered from delays in issuing environmental licenses to increase their oil activity in the llanos orientales for most of last year attacks against the industry despite advances in security in recent years the oil infrastructure remains one of the main targets of terrorists both in the northeast and in the southwest of the country attacks against oil pipelines increased last year and so far this year the situation has been similar the canadian firm gran tierra energy with a presence in catatumbo and putumayo is one of those affected by the interruptions in the supply of crude oil through the pipelines affected by the attacks in our case we have had to increase transportation by tank trucks with all the implications that this generates such as increased costs and risk said jeff collins vice president of business development for gran tierra energy these structural problems of the industry must be solved in the shortest possible time to maintain the level of investment and production the oil company sold three minor fields ecopetrol closed the sale transaction of its participation in three minor fields to the company petroleos sud americanos sa petrosud for a value of us   million in a press release the oil company reported that these are the el dificil fields el dificil exploitation agreement located in the lower magdalena valley basin entrerrios entrerrios exploitation agreement and guarimena rio meta exploitation agreement located in los llanos the divestment in these fields is part of the strategy to optimize the companys asset portfolio the process that began in june  led to the qualification of  companies that met the requirements to participate in a public auction that took place on november   explained the oil company petrosud was the company that made the best offer for the fields that have  reserves proven and probable of  million barrels of oil equivalent of the three fields auctioned the only one currently in production is entrerrios opinions orlando cabrales segovia vice minister of energy it is true that there are delays in environmental licenses but in recent months the process has improved and we are working to reach  months javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol the construction of works such as the bicentenario pipeline takes two or three years but lasts for half a century or more i am very proud of this work mintrabajo mediated to resolve the conflict between ecopetrol and uso this friday the ministry of labor confirmed that an agreement was reached that allowed an end to the labor dispute between ecopetrol and the union sindical obrera uso and which completed eight years the comprehensive and definitive agreement between the parties reached after eight continuous months of talks includes recognition of time wages benefits and other benefits that have been agreed the ministry mediated during the debates through the special commission for the treatment of conflicts cecoit an office that invited each of the intervening parties to dialogue in august  after the two parties went to different judicial instances stating that the strike started by workers in  when  people were fired for their alleged participation in the november  and march  stoppages it was illegal or not at the time the case was presented before the committee on freedom of association of the international labor organization ilo a body that on several occasions called on the colombian government to take the necessary measures and advised that the decision to dismiss these workers be revoked the minister of labor rafael pardo who participated as a witness in the mediation was pleased and welcomed the decision while highlighting the willingness constructive attitude and willingness of the representatives of ecopetrol and the uso to generate consensusthe labor dispute between ecopetrol and the uso ends after eight months of talks between the members of the petroleum industry workers union uso and the ecopetrol directives the ministry of labor put an end to the differences that existed between the parties the conflict dates back eight years when a strike in  was declared illegal in which  employees of the oil company were fired for allegedly participating in the work stoppages in november  and march  the lawsuit was taken to several judicial instances in which the conflict was declared legal or illegal but in august of the previous year the special commission for the treatment of conflicts of the ministry of labor cecoit called on the two parties to resolve the differences and for the conflict to end it should be mentioned that this case was taken to the committee on freedom of association of the international labor organization ilo to mediate between the parties which recommended that the state be in charge of providing solutions that is why the agency turned to the national government to take the necessary measures and revoke the decision to dismiss the employees by the company ecopetrols director of labor relations ayde mary ramirez pointed out that dialogue is the only way to prove to the country the construction of a union relationship with the company since it overcomes any difficulties and will be a model at the international levelnew discovery of ecopetrol in meta the third of  ecopetrol reported that it tested the presence of hydrocarbons in the  exploratory well located in the municipality of san carlos de guaroa in the department of meta the president of the oil company javier gutierrez stressed that this discovery is key because it joins another discovery announced in march in the same block  and others made in nearby blocks such as  and cpo  which confirms the potential of this area of the llanos in which ecopetrol has focused its exploratory campaign  the results of the initial tests carried out with an artificial lift system yielded crude oil production of   api with an average flow of  barrels per day and a water cut of  the  well which is ecopetrols third discovery in  is part of the  exploration and production contract signed on december   between ecopetrol and the national hydrocarbons agencyecopetrols new discovery did not have a great impact on the oil companys action after ecopetrol announced a new finding of hydrocarbons in the country the impact on the share was practically nil since on the day it managed to only rise  until the price for each of its shares was   according to the report the discovery was made in the  block where the oil company has a  stake regarding production the first measurements show an average flow of  barrels per day a figure that is not significant when taking into account ecopetrols total production with this according to diego franco equity analyst at asesoria e inversiones the news will have no impact in the short term unless the company provides more information that raises expectations in the area likewise according to jorge bello equity analyst at actions and securities more remains to be known but the prospect of the well is positive until now only the first deliveries are known so a little more information is lacking about the potential that the well may have still in general it is a block that could have quite a lot of potential  regarding the behavior of the rest of the securities that are listed on the stock market on the earnings side valores industriales stands out which rose  leaving its shares at   behind the titles of grupo aval were found again the preferred stock rose  to   and the common  to   on the negative side the preferential of inversiones argos which fell  leaving its securities at   likewise isagen lost  to   and isa down  to   in indices the igbc rose  to  units in addition the  had a rise of  and colcap fell ecopetrol acquires a  stake in three blocks in caguan ecopetrol reached an agreement with emerald energy to acquire a  interest in the exploration and production contracts called manzano cardon and nogal located in the caguan basin in the department of caqueta which were signed between emerald energy and the national hydrocarbons agency anh in  according to the agreement which was signed in the city of beijing ecopetrol will be the operator in the cardon block and emerald energy a subsidiary of the state china sinochem will retain the remaining  operating the nogal blocks and manzano the manzano contract was signed on november   has an area of  hectares and commitments in the first phase of  km of  seismic the cardon contract was signed on october    hectares and the commitment of the first phase is the acquisition of  km of  seismic the nogal contract was signed on october    hectares and  km of  seismic will be acquired in the first phase the agreement in each case will be subject to final approval by the national hydrocarbons agencyecopetrol seeks to increase its reserves with a  stake in three blocks the week has been very positive for ecopetrol due to the agreement reached with the oil company emerald energy to acquire a  stake in the exploration and production contracts in the manzano cardon and nogal blocks located in the caguan basin caqueta  which would allow it to increase hydrocarbon reserves thus the local firm will be the operator in the cardon block while emerald energy a subsidiary of the stateowned china sinochem will retain the remaining  operating the nogal and manzano blocks according to amilcar acosta medina member of the board of directors of the oil company with this participation the firm seeks rather than achieving the goal of one million barrels per day to incorporate greater reserves with the aim of replacing those that are being extracted at the moment acosta also pointed out that they expect this news to have a very positive impact on the share price for his part hernando barrero president of acipet affirmed that the concern to increase more and more reserves helps ecopetrol continue to search for fields such as cano limon or cusiana with very positive volumes to increase the time of said reserves the blocks are located in one of the focus areas of ecopetrols exploration strategy in the caguanputumayo basin where it already has a position in the blocks known as put  samichay a and samichay b although the details are not yet known production levels of these three blocks barrero pointed out that good possibilities are emerging for this area however the objective of increasing reserves is also strengthened with the announcement that the company made this monday when it reported a new discovery in the  exploratory well located in the department of meta of which the firm is the owner of the  of the participation interests according to javier gutierrez pemberthy president of the oil company this discovery is key because it joins another discovery announced in march in the same block  and others made in nearby blocks such as  and cpo  which confirms the potential of this area of the llanos in which ecopetrol has focused its exploratory campaign  until march of this year ecopetrol had participation in  exploration blocks in colombia  of them directly operated by the company and the remaining  operated by other companies in terms of production assets  blocks were produced in association  is the firms third discovery of the year at the beginning of this year ecopetrol announced hydrocarbon discoveries in the  and  wells located in the department of meta the latest discovery of the  well has yielded a crude oil production of   api with an average flow of  barrels per day and a water cut of  in the initial tests that were carried out the company continues exploratory work on these wells with the aim of confirming future production opinions amilcar acosta medina member of the board of directors of ecopetrol the fundamental purpose is to incorporate more and more reserves to replace those that are currently being extracted hernando barrera president of acipet ecopetrol is looking for a large deposit like cusiana or cano limon which will increase the reserve time that the country hasecopetrol obtains financing for   billion the state oil company reported that it obtained financing for a total of   trillion with local banks for a debt restructuring operation the financing was achieved for a  term with a threeyear grace period at a yield of the dtf rate plus an anticipated  quarter ecopetrol said in a statementecopetrol contracted in the central western region with more than   million a hiring of more than   million in labor and goods and services between the validity of  and so far in  and an investment of   million in environmental issues are part of the balance that ecopetrol presented yesterday in pereira in the first surrender of accounts this year carried out for the occidente region that comprises caldas quindio risaralda and valle del cauca the president of the state oil company javier gutierrez pointed out that the firm has placed more than   billion in social investment which includes a park a health center and a school basically in dosquebradas where a tragedy occurred on december   when a section of the puerto salgarcartago pipeline exploded that left  people dead ecopetrol points out that the event happened due to a sudden displacement of the land and a report from the autonomous corporation of risaralda indicated problems in the pipeline gutierrez pointed out that  conciliation agreements have been signed with the relatives of the deceased representing about   million in total we have invested about   million in dosquebradas in all emergency care in the subsequent stages and in infrastructure works he said the president of ecopetrol indicates that the firm is carrying out an analysis of technical economic social and environmental feasibility to have an alternative that allows relocating the pipeline line that passes through dosquebradas the analysis would be ready at the end of the yearecopetrol will find it expensive to borrow in pesos the governments move for ecopetrol to borrow in pesos with local banks and not in dollars could have an adverse result for the company and the fact is that the lower rates found in international markets mean that borrowing in pesos is costing the oil company more expensive ecopetrol had been benefiting from the policies of international central banks which with very low rates offer very cheap financing however the minister of finance mauricio cardenas asked the oil company as a mechanism to control the revaluation not to borrow abroad under the pretext that taking those credits and converting them would affect the attempt to weaken the currency following this recommendation ecopetrol took out a  loan for an amount of   trillion with  colombian banks at a floating rate equivalent to around  in dollars in view of this ecopetrols dollar bonds maturing in  were trading  above the united states treasury while maturing in  the company would have paid around  on a  bond years thus and taking into account that it is estimated that the oil company will need us   million until  for its investments it now has the prospect of paying more in interest to finance its operations with this analysts believe that ecopetrol lost the opportunity to borrow cheaper by issuing international bonds which would have generated better profitability bonds and emerging currencies fell on speculation that the federal reserve would reduce its purchases and that led investors to less developed countries that offer higher returns according to eduardo vieira corporate debt analyst at itau unibanco holding sa issuing bonds would have been the cheapest way to finance its capital expenditures now they will not have financing problems but it will cost them more this idea is shared by diego usme an equity analyst at ultraburstiles considering that not borrowing outside is an important opportunity cost although he assures that the company is compensating it hiring local debt is more expensive but ecopetrol is carrying out a strategy in which it is liquidating its previous debt with new cheaper loans so if before it was funded at dtf   now it will do so at dtf   so the debt service will decrease  in addition as he added another point to take into account is that ecopetrol is investment grade so its cost of funding is relatively low for his part francisco chaves director of economic studies at corredores asociados believes that despite the higher cost local debt offers him more security and ease in obtaining his resources with this another of the main questions in the market is whether these higher costs will take a toll on the oil company in the next quarterly results analysts agree that it will clearly have higher costs although the final impact will not be so decisive for chaves ecopetrols bad figures have been seen more from the operational side so this item will not have as relevant an impact as reserves or their costs likewise usme explained that the highest financing cost goes towards the balance sheet so the impact on the results being more dynamic will not be important when changing the terms of the debt petrobras demonstrated the good time to sell bonds something that confirmed the fact that today is a good time to sell bonds in the united states market was the operation carried out by the brazilian petrobras since before the worst moment of the liquidation for rent fixed emerging the state oil producer of that country sold  notes on may  with a yield of  within the framework of a debt sale of us   million the largest in history for an issuer of emerging market according to bloomberg this confirms that ecopetrol could also have benefited from the opportunity in the united states since the national company shares the same credit rating as its brazilian counterpart diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles although local borrowing is an opportunity cost the company is refinancing its local debt at lower rates francisco chaves associate broker research editor although this may entail higher costs than it would have had in dollars a very negative impact on its results is not expectedecopetrol among the  most valued firms in the world for the first time in the history of companies listed on the colombian stock exchange one of the issuers is part of the ranking of the  companies with the largest market capitalization in the world according to the pwc report as of march  the only colombian company on the list is ecopetrol which occupies position  with a market value of us   million in  for  the capitalization of the oil company reached us   million which represents a growth of  in its market value in five years oil companies have an important participation in the ranking however what is striking is that the colombian oil company surpasses the brazilian giant petrobras in two positions thus following pwc data petrobras is ranked  with a market capitalization of us   million this company fell  places compared to the  ranking when its market value was us   million this is not the first time that ecopetrol has surpassed its brazilian counterpart last year it had also done so but it is curious that despite the situation that is being seen with the commodities market the colombian company continues to maintain a solid position for the analyst of shares of ultraburstiles diego usme the difference in the business models and the policies of each country have affected the two companies in general the brazilian government has policies that limit the growth and expansion plans of the company while ecopetrol is driven by other types of situations that are not only limited to having a good administration but have also met the goals proposals so far in the local market  thus it is evident that although the two companies are very different in size the stock market rewards ecopetrol for the goals achieved but punishes petrobras for the limitations to continue growing another aspect that usme highlights is that although the colombian companys share has registered a drop of around  during the year this performance among regional oil companies is more positive the expectations of the market agents and the projection of the company is positive not only due to the fact per se of having a higher price because that what it shows is the intention of the investors but it is a market issue says the stock market analyst likewise according to diego franco an analyst at asesoria e inversiones petrobrass share has had a rating downgrade on its expansion plans and this has punished the prices of the foreign oil company this news is positive because it creates a message of stability for the company because although a strong impact is not expected on the entire stock market it does send a message of stability after the tension that the markets have had after the situation and the international data at present ecopetrol is in the markets sights for the execution of its investment plan which for this year is close to   billion of which at the end of the first quarter it had   billion in cash which is why the the financing mechanisms that it will use which may be the expected issuance of bonds after having gained  basis points with the refinancing of debt in pesos that was recently carried out other results of the ranking several aspects can be highlighted from the ranking presented by pwc on the one hand there is the leadership of the united states companies since eight of the first  are of american origin where apple stands out occupying the first place and a market capitalization of us   million in the second place in the classification is the oil company exxon mobil with us   million of market value it follows to complete the google podium that has us   million in five years apple has risen  places in this ranking compared to  for google while exxon on the other hand has lost its leadership likewise amid the volatility of the markets  of the  largest companies of  continue in the ranking this year technology companies stand out among the sectors that have shone the most in recent years proof of this is that its capitalization has increased  regarding latin american companies the participation of four brazilians stands out petrobras vale sa itau and bradesco a mexican america movil and the colombian ecopetrol thus despite the moment of the stock markets in the world large companies continue to gain value correction would be seen in the coming months one of the aspects that must be highlighted this year has been the downward behavior of emerging markets and the rebound in the united states whose indices have reached alltime highs this behavior will cause that when the ranking is rebuilt latin american stocks may lose some positions for alianza valores stock analyst juan david ballen ecopetrols share has fallen more than petrobrass but it maintains the good streak of years ago in terms of multiples the colombian company has a market cap of  and that of petrobras is   in this way what is expected is that the shares of emerging countries enter a state of laterality with a downward trend but as in all cases a significant rebound would come later opinions diego usme analyst of ultraburstiles shares the policies of colombia and brazil are different in energy matters which allows ecopetrol to have greater incentives juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores in general emerging markets have had a bad year and they will surely lose positions in the ranking due to the devaluation of securities diego franco advisory and investment analyst in this case what we are seeing is that the two shares have lost value but the fall has been stronger for petrobrasthe fall of the bvc is expensive to the capitalization of ecopetrol much has been said about the large falls that the colombian stock exchange has registered so far this year which have already reached  for the igbc and  for the colcap and under this context he sees that the great loser of this trend is ecopetrol currently the market capitalization of the oil company is around   billion while the figures as of june   gave it   billion this means that in the last year the oil company has lost  of its market value which translates into a difference of more than   billion even so if you look at the data at the end of the previous year you can see a small slowdown in the rate of this decline since so far this year the decline is  this bad behavior without a doubt has cost ecopetrol expensive as stated by juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores last year the company was the oil company with the largest market capitalization in the region a first place that petrobras has just snatched with a difference of us   millions similarly jorge bello equity analyst at stocks and securities assured that ecopetrol is the most punished because it is the one with the highest weight within the local indices what we are seeing is that the liquid part of the market is highly concentrated in  stocks that have  of the colcap index therefore it is natural that they are the most exposed and respond more to the movements of international markets but this negative trend not only remains in ecopetrol but also spreads to the rest of the market according to the figures corresponding to the end of june the capitalization of the listed companies as a whole has decreased  since the beginning of  going from   billion to   billion in this sense the reason for the negative behavior is clear according to ballen the loss in market capitalization comes from the general sale of emerging assets as has been seen investors are selling assets from emerging countries because these economies are slowing down due to the better prospects in developed ones even so it is important to note that the phenomenon experienced by the colombian plaza is widespread in the region according to daniel lozano director of economic studies at serfinco the performance has been less unfavorable than that of other comparable companies such as peru and so far the local market has had fewer declines it must be borne in mind that the fact that the market capitalization falls is an automatic reflection of the loss of value that the countrys companies are having and therefore a lower price of the shares when looking at the rest of the companies that have the highest capitalization although they are smaller increases in the indicator can be observed these are the cases of grupo aval which has gone from   billion to   billion in  bancolombia which increased its figure from   billion to   billion or grupo sura which went to   billion from the   billion it had at the beginning of the year meanwhile companies such as cementos argos or isa have reported declines of   billion and   billion the worrying thing at this point is that market expectations happen because this phenomenon continues during the rest of the year which could even take the market capitalization below   billion before the end of the year according to ballen know the impact of the fall so it is important that you bear in mind the impact that it can have for you if you are an investor and have your money in shares of these companies with this the main thing is to consider that the fall in capitalization has a direct relationship with the price of the share that you have purchased therefore if you have positions in these companies you may lose money on your investment despite this as jorge bello stated the impact will not be the same for everyone when it comes to measuring the losses of each of the investors you must always look at the entry price at which the share was acquired and on the other hand keep in mind the amount and amounts that have been received thanks to the dividends which it defines whether the impact is greater or less in each case  he concluded for now experts are pessimistic about how the market will perform in the coming months so be patient biomax approved its share issuance yesterday the biomax shareholders meeting was held a meeting in which the conversations revolved around the issuance of company shares finally its investors gave the goahead and the fuel distributor will be able to issue a total of  million ordinary shares the placement of which will be subject to the right of first refusal and will have a price of   for each security it should not be forgotten that uno colombia recently launched a takeover bid to keep the majority of the stake in the hydrocarbons company daniel lozano director of economic research  serfinco despite the falls you cannot see that there is a crisis but rather a process of market adjustment jorge bello equity and securities equity analyst a fall in market capitalization has an impact on the pocket as the share loses value and there is less wealthgovernment approves ecopetrol bond issuance to boost the dollar finally the national government gave the guarantee to the main company in the country ecopetrol to make a bond issue the good thing about this measure for the interests of the nation is that it will help the cardenas dollar to continue to reach more than   according to alejandro reyes director of economic studies at ultraburstiles without a doubt the approval of this issue aims to boost the dollar the state is given guarantees that there will be monetization this is done despite the fact that outside the country the company has cheaper resources than inside  the truth is that the ministry of finance has already authorized the state oil company to issue subscribe and place public debt bonds of up to   billion these resources would be invested to finance part of the investment plan and the new businesses approved by the companys board of directors among other corporate projects ecopetrol sources assure that some procedures are necessary and that the date on which these bonds will be released to the colombian market is defined the value of each bond would be up to   million with a maturity period between  and  years three classes of papers will be issued series a will be issued in pesos setting a fixed annual effective rate class b will be in pesos with a floating rate referenced to the dtf series c will also be placed in pesos with a floating rate that will be referenced according to the ipc and series d will be placed in pesos with a floating rate set according to the ibr commercial papers will also be issued with a minimum investment of   million and will consist of  series in the first series a they will be issued in pesos and will accrue with a fixed interest the capital paid will be delivered when these papers expire series b will be issued in pesos and may accrue with floating interest which will be subject to the dtf the paid capital will be made at the maturity of the paper series c will be issued in pesos and may be paid with floating interest assessed in accordance with the ibr at the end of the interest charge period the capital paid at the maturity of the papers and finally series d will be issued in pesos and will accrue with floating interest referenced with the ipc payment will be made at the expiration of the papermercado expects ecopetrols bond issuance to be close to   trillion with the approval of the authorities and the ministry of finance ecopetrol is preparing to make its expected placement of debt in the colombian stock market as lr learned the company has already visited several stock brokers to invite them to participate in the issue so it is only waiting for the right moment to go on the market a survey carried out by this newspaper gives as a result that the debt placement would not be made for the total amount that the oil company has approved of   billion but that it would be close to   billion the operation would be carried out in the last quarter of the year because for the analysts consulted this is not the right time to issue a given due to the situation in interest rates however in a few months a change would be seen and there would be the opportunity according to juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores ecopetrol is waiting for the market to stabilize as an important point is that the companys bonds are country risk bonds so they are closer to the behavior of the tes which currently they are not going through their best moment  if the issuance is made for at least   billion it would be the highest so far in  after the one made by terpel with which it achieved   million in this way the oil company will have to evaluate several aspects on the one hand the market conditions but on the other its investment plans daniel velandia director of economic research at credicorp capital explains that in order to maximize value the company must assess whether there is enough liquidity to overdemand an offer of that size we do believe that you need funds this year so at least you will have to get   million or   trillion that would be enough for the financing need the more it would be difficult to achieve says velandia ecopetrol needs this money to comply with its investment plan which for this year is just over   billion and the company has about   billion in cash what we see is that there is a need to broadcast they did not do it in the first semester so they would do so in this second however it is difficult to give an exact date says diego usme analyst at ultraburstiles the truth is that at this time ecopetrol has approved a debt quota of up to   trillion which would be placed in its entirety in the local stock market in order to continue contributing to the depreciation of the peso in addition the board of the oil company has the approval of the assembly to carry out the operation without the need to summon the partners which is why as jorge cardozo analyst of the commission agent corredores asociados says it only remains to look at when the market will have desire to buy because so far there are neither issuers nor buyers pending emissions for   trillion if one takes into account that ecopetrol would not issue its entire approved quota the amount of pending emissions for the second half of  is reduced by   trillion in this way alpina corficolombiana cemex gases del caribe molymet and sociedades bolivar companies that are waiting for the right moment to make their placements will have a total of   trillion in their hands for the private debt market analysts agree that market conditions will define whether or not they come out opinions daniel velandia director of economic research credicorp capital today the issue would not be successful due to market conditions however we believe that it does need the funds this year  jorge cardozo associate broker analyst you have to look at the market and how attractive the rates offered by the company can be to have the buyers you needrepsol will sell  of the block to ecopetrol after approval by minminas de peru ecopetrol will strengthen its presence in peru with the purchase of a  stake in block  from repsol of peru which was approved yesterday by the peruvian

country ecopetrol obtained a new patent for the technological developments that are being carried out the superintendency of industry and commerce sic granted the oil company the rights for ten years of the belt tensioner for mechanical pumping units as reported by the organization this new device is capable of increasing the useful life and simplifying the activities of the belts and pulleys that are used in the hydrocarbon extraction process through the machines in the oil fields in the communication sent by ecopetrol it is stated that this is a mobile table system that allows adjusting and replacing said transmission belts that allow the movement of the mechanical pumping units of the operations additionally belt tensioner technology reduces the time needed to perform maintenance operations by a quarter which minimizes operating costs and losses from keeping an infrastructure out of service according to the company these utility model patents provide additional value to the oil companys operations by enhancing the functionality and use of existing inventions likewise some minor modifications can be made to the belt tensioner so that the device can be used together with other equipment that has a transmission belt system technology to this patent two others obtained by the state oil company in april must be added one of them is the combined system for the removal of organic phenols and the reduction of wastewater toxicity which is an application of combined technologies to reduce water pollution in hydrocarbon production processes the second patent is the combined system for the removal of organic phenols and the reduction of the toxicity of wastewater which helps to reduce water pollution in hydrocarbon production processesecopetrol contracted with

company ecopetrol are expected which according to the experts will not register a major change compared to the first quarter of the year according to analysts weak results are anticipated compared to the second quarter of  despite the fact that the price of a barrel of oil has increased in recent months for sebastian gallego equity analyst at corredores asociados expectations are not very high for ecopetrols results in the second quarter of the year oil prices similar to those of  are expected so we should not see very broad growth although we expect some improvement they would be weak in the second quarter  according to a survey carried out by lr to the different commission agents it is expected that for the second quarter of the year operating income will reach an average of   billion that is  more than in the first quarter where they got   billion regarding net profits the company is expected to register a figure close to   billion which represents  more than in the previous period in which the result was   billion for valeria marconi analyst at credicorp capital we expect better results from the second half of the year mainly due to the increase in oil prices that has already begun to be observed as well as the entry into operation of the bicentenario pipeline and some initiatives to cost reduction  likewise diego franco an analyst at asesorias e inversiones sa points out that the only factors that would help the company in this period are the entry of new projects that amortize the cost issue higher value of the exchange rate compared to the previous period coupled with higher reference oil prices sold which could help to prevent production declines from greatly affecting the companys figures and cash flow the values reported by the oil company will no longer have the same volatile effect on the share price because although since  the company has reported acceptable figures the high growth rates are no longer strong and this is explained by the entry of ecopetrol to a maturation process where its growth will be slow limited without major impact on the market he says likewise the analyst highlights that there will be production figures in a range of  and  barrels per day another factor highlighted by the experts in the low results that the oil company would present are the constant protests in fields located in the catatumbo and orinoquia areas as well as the problems in the cano limon covenas oil pipeline which has suffered several terrorist attacks in the period covered for results of the second quarter of the year in this area no major surprises are expected given the latest reports of crude production in colombia where the greatest effects are in areas and blocks operated by it the greatest impact is due to guerrilla attacks and others emphasizes franco  on the other hand the oil company would benefit from the exchange rate that has been higher in price than the comparable period in  and this could offset the drop in production and possible increases in costs the analysts consulted say according to maria adelaida velazquez serfinco oil analyst the results on the production side will be negative due to lower prices however the increase in the exchange rate could boost it considering that it was averaging   and now it is around    thus analysts conclude that they expect a very similar behavior in ecopetrols results compared to  and in the second semester both the price of oil and the exchange rate would improve the outlook production would have a slight increase for the second quarter of  production is expected to maintain a slight increase reaching around  barrels per day likewise if the current growth rate of earnings is maintained and a profit distribution policy of  ordinary dividend plus extraordinary is maintained the estimated dividend for  is temporarily at   per share this would be equivalent to a  yield price  dividend stable with respect to  for now the report presented by the company is expected next wednesday the opinions juan david ballen analyst alianza valores ecopetrol would maintain stable its quarterly profits in a range close to   billion that is  less than the second quarter of  diego franco analista asesorias e inversiones sa the values reported by the oil company will no longer have the same volatile effect on the share price the high growth

begun to be observed as well as the entry into operation of the bicentennial pipeline and some initiatives to cost reduction  regarding exploration and exploitation activities barrero pointed out that although the three discoveries that the company has made so far this year are not enough due to the number of reserves they are looking for they are significant for the production goal of  barrels

 barrels per day the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez pemberthy highlighted at the time that this discovery was key because it joins others made in nearby blocks such as  and  and confirms the potential of this area of the eastern plains on which ecopetrol has focused its exploratory campaign  german corredor director of the national universitys energy observatory pointed out that another aspect of the first semester that should be highlighted within ecopetrols activity is the progress made by the works of the cartagena refinery reficar as of may this year the firm reported that the general advance was  while construction passed the  curve and was at  it is estimated that this project is strategic for ecopetrol and for the country as it will double the refinerys capacity to

of  the oil company reported revenues in the order of   billion and while the net profit amounted to   billion opinions hernando barrero president of acipet one of the limitations that ecopetrol has had is insecurity since there has been an increase in attacks on oil infrastructure alvaro yunes president of fedispetroleo i do not see a clarity within ecopetrols balance sheets that allows transparency as long as the price of fuel is politicalecopetrols profits fell  in the first half ecopetrol sas net profit in the first half of  amounted to   billion and in the second quarter of  it

third discovery in  also the subordinate hocol drilled a successful exploratory well in the semester regarding transportation on april  the contracts between ecopetrol and cenit were signed which marked the beginning of a new era in the business model of this segment this will bring important benefits for our company as well as for the hydrocarbons sector in colombia as a result of this new model we began to pay transportation rates regulated by the ministry of mines and energy in the main pipelines these transportation costs should be offset in the future with the higher profit that the segment will generate now led by our subsidiary cenit  said the report ecopetrol substituted the financial obligation for   billion and extended the term by five years in addition it reduced the interest rate by  additionally it obtained   million to finance the investment planpemex and petroperu seek to replicate ecopetrols model to modernize in a highly competitive industry with expensive entry barriers and risky investments latin american state oil companies seek to find a balance to capitalize on public means and at the same time attract more private investment as ecopetrol did  years ago the success of the colombian state company in taking  of the ownership of the company to the stock market left peruvians thinking the nationalized company petroperu announced yesterday that it would take  of its shares to the market between  and  in amounts of  per year according to the countrys ministry of energy and mines the issuance plan seeks to help the company take on new projects and improve its profit margins with a better capitalization the oil company will seek to improve its goals for  going from an operating profit of  to  in addition it plans to increase the return on investment from  to  in the same period of time and expects to operate seven exploration lots according to the report published in the newspaper el peruano hernando barrero president of acipet assured that this benefits the oil companies because they have one more option to finance new projects in addition to receiving new technologies and information if they have alliances with other multinational firms but petroperu is not the only one seeking to change its model one of the largest oil companies in the region pemex could receive private and foreign investment if president enrique pena nietos energy reform is approved pena nieto assured that he will present the first proposal of the plan this week to be debated during the next two months in congress which proposes changes to the constitution that would allow the company to receive private investment in order to increase production without stopping it to be from the state however german corredor director of the energy observatory of the national university assured that the process in mexico will be more complicated since it is a very particular case because pemex has been a symbol of national pride that at the beginning of the  century was nationalized and it became a flag of the pri political party that is why it is a highly sensitive political issue however a mix between state and public have brought benefits to both ecopetrol and the brazilian company petrobras which have increased in size and investment after taking stock to the stock market and granting attractive returns to their investors oil production in brazil increased  among the latin oil companies that opted for a combination of state and public ownership is petrobras which with its growth managed to become the largest oil company in the region this has helped brazils oil production in june to add  million barrels per day an increase of  compared to may in addition gas extraction broke a record in june at  million cubic meters per day a  increase from may german corredor dir observatorio de energia de la u nacional this is a model that if well managed is very successful because states usually have problems capitalizing on these companies hernando barrero president of acipet oil projects need millions of dollars if the company is small and without much capital it will take longer to grow ecopetrol announces that it has authorization to issue bonds of up to   billion the oil company ecopetrol announced that it obtained authorization from the financial superintendency to begin the registration in the national registry of securities and issuers and the public offering of some internal public debt bonds and commercial papers that are part of an issuance and placement program and which would be in the amount of up to   billion according to the report the company would have three years to make the issue which can be done in various packages or tranches likewise it was clarified that the board of directors of the company will be in charge of issuing authorization on particular terms and conditions when any issue is made under the program authorized by the superfinancialcuprum ecopetrol and cencosud are the most traded shares on the mila to this day the behavior of the latin american integrated market mila still does not meet the expectations that had been set however there are certain values that have taken advantage of the benefits offered by the union this is the case of afp cuprum ecopetrol and cencosud shares that have registered significant levels in their trading volume in this sense the figures as of june cut show how the ranking is led by the chilean cupum with a total of us   million followed by ecopetrol with us   million and cencosud with the amount of us   million in the market in fourth place is the retail company falabella which registered us   million followed by enersis with us   million sociedad quimica y minera de chile which had us   million latam airlines group which managed to move the figure of us   million and finally pacific rubiales with us   million however despite the positive news coming from the individual companies the total volume traded on the mila during june maintained the negative trend that it has registered so far this year according to the figures in this period us   million were negotiated which represents a negative variation of  while the accumulated of the year the mila reaches us   million regarding the market capitalization for the integrated market between chile  peru and colombia there is a drop of  so far this year as the market went from us   million in december  to us   million in june in addition to this the report revealed the participation of the three countries where the colombian stock exchange registered a percentage of  the lima stock exchange  and the santiago stock exchange with the higher percentage  at the end of the first semester the changes in the participation of each market according to the experts is due to the weak behavior of the latin american stock markets during  a fact that has been due to conjunctural issues such as the pronouncements of the federal reserve and the european macroeconomic situations that they have generated international uncertainty and especially in latin america as investment flows have been affected in addition to this for jose dario lozano head of shares of alianza valores the main reason for the fall of the mila markets is a general devaluation of emerging stock markets due to the migration of resources to developed markets due to a slowdown in them  said as lozano added particularly the igbvl the lima stock exchange index is the most affected by the high participation of mining companies within the index this is due to the fact that when reviewing the evolution of gold and copper prices during the first semester it is observed that they fell by about  and  respectively on the other hand it is believed that the lower devaluation of the chilean ipsa is due in part to the greater diversification of its stock market he said with this the sp mila  which brings together the general performance of the market accumulates a negative variation so far this year of  meanwhile at the end of the sixth month of  the ipsa shows a fall of  the colcap  and the igbvl of  for diana mosquera analyst at global securities the case of chile is explained because it focuses on the financial and energy issues sectors that had a negative behavior and that today have been improving something that does not assure to have or to reverse a positive trend in the market in the same sense mosquera assured that colombia has had a negative participation but has been showing a recovery in prices in the local stock market compared to markets such as peru and chile despite the bad figures experts expect that for the second semester the different countries will report a positive behavior since this aims to develop the capital market of the countries that make it up by improving their supply of securities issues and financing thus despite the possibility that the market will show some improvement before the end of the year it is clear that the mila is still a project that still lacks operational details eight new issuers entered the mila although the results in the latin american integrated market have not yet taken off in the figures for the month of june it can be noted that eight new issuers joined this platform which means that today there are a total of  companies operating specifically the new mila companies are the chilean besalco sa empresas cmpc sa saci falabella masisa sa paz corp sa grupo security sa and the peruvians peru holding de turismo saa and grupo acp corp saa similarly the company faro capital real estate investment fund made its official entry into the market through the lima stock exchange opinions diana mosquera global securities analyst we are in season to know the income statements while chile has not yet presented them even if it had a positive trend it would not achieve a great impact  jose dario lozano head of shares in alliance values the volumes of the stock exchanges that make up the mila totaled us   billion in the semester and chiles leadership was maintained in terms of greater participationsuperfinanciera gives free rein to ecopetrols internal debt plan the state oil company gives more details on the characteristics of the possible debt issuance in colombia thus according to the superfinanciera the public offering of internal public debt bonds and commercial papers that are part of a   trillion issuance program will have the following conditions the bonds will be issued in four series with a nominal value per bond of   and the minimum investment for those

commercial papers the nominal value will be   each and the minimum investment of   the redemption terms will be greater than  days and less than one year from the date of subscription financing abroad on the other hand ecopetrol sa reported that as part of the procedures required to keep the debt alternatives in force to finance its longterm investment plan it obtained from the ministry of finance and public credit through resolution  of august   authorization to manage the issuance of bonds in the international capital market for up to the sum of three trillion dollars us   this authorization in itself does not constitute an issuance of securities or an operation of financing therefore ecopetrol must carry out in due course all the necessary approval procedures before the ministry of finance and public credit as well as before its board of directors for any debt operation under this authorizationecopetrol previsora and isa the untouchables of the government the sale of isagen will be the  privatization of the government in the last  years after this a fact that no longer has a turn the government has to sell in its range of assets  companies in which it has political control that is more than  of the shareholding with the energy output the state will be left with three crown jewels ecopetrol isa and previsora the colombian state has an equity stake in companies with assets in the order of us   million and the latter are important for their efforts to increase the tax revenue of the nation the oil company heads the top of the most valuable companies in total there are eight companies with assets above   billion three are from the energy sector two from the financial sector and one from banks in the last two decades colombia has been optimizing its portfolio of companies of the  firms it has sold  were privatized in  at which time the institutional foundations for the sale of public assets began this group of companies is heterogeneous and most of the firms it has with political control have a value between   billion and   trillion the largest participation is held by the energy sector with four companies in recent years more companies in this sector have been in the governments sights in fact in the juan manuel santos administration there has been only one disposal and it was that of the boyaca energy company ebsa for   million ebsa was part of the group of electricity companies that has been in the process of sale which is still in force as stated by the minister of mines and energy federico renjifo these are meta huila narino and caqueta grupo argos celsia and epsa after isagen isagen the third largest generator of electricity in the country constitutes one of the most important assets for the government and is now in line for it to privatize  of its shareholding  the first auction will start on august  and will go to the solidarity sector with a base price of   per share then there will be a public auction for which companies such as grupo argos together with its energy subsidiaries celsia which has  of the energy market and epsa have expressed their interest in participating in it according to grupo argos it and its energy subsidiaries are preparing to be qualified as strategic investors suitable to participate in the second phase of the sale process in the opinion of the president of grupo argos jose alberto velez isagen is an attractive opportunity indeed the company which has  of the total capacity of the national interconnected system if it manages to keep the energy company it would reach a  stake surpassing epm  and emgesa   in terms of generation according to a recent report by grupo bancolombia investigations with the startup of sogamoso which would be the fifth largest generation plant in colombia isagens installed capacity will increase by  this would boost financial figures which would be reflected in an increase in revenues of  to   billion  the three scenarios of the sale the government expects to raise at least   billion from the sale of isagen for the most optimistic it could reach the value of   billion established by the ministry of finance among those is manuel maiguashca former deputy minister of mines who said that the deadlines that exist allow for the sale to be made this year and the established prices are paid this would not include the premium the extra amount that the buyer must pay to acquire control in an optimistic medium are those who believe that with the premium the sale would reach   billion or even more another scenario according to the director of the national university energy observatory german corredor can reach   billion but it is relative those who buy are willing to pay premiums to acquire them among the less optimistic the bid will depend on how many players participate julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines stated that the sale would be between   billion and   billion with the premium the concern for vera is timing although the government has said that the resources will be used after august   they would fear a change in their destination which is investment in infrastructure doing the business at this time generates noise due to the electoral campaign and can make investors see a risk for investments in the change of government and reduce the offer in the auction issuer has bought us   million during the year to july banco de la republica has made purchases of foreign currency in the exchange market through the direct purchase auction mechanism for us   million in the month of july alone this figure was us   million during the same month the bank did not make definitive purchases or sales of tes b at the end of july the balance of said securities in its possession amounted to   million on the other hand new figures for the issuers foreign exchange balance revealed that in july foreign direct investment fdi fell  in the first seven months of this year investment flows accumulated us   million while in the same period of  these amounted to us   million however in july  fdi grew  opinions manuel maiguashca former vice minister of mines if the isagen process is successful in its first phase the figure established by the government will surely be achieved in the end it will be a bid and it will be a single winner  julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at minminas doing the isagen business at this time generates noise due to the electoral campaign and may make investors see a risk in the change of governmentefforts to stop the revaluation will hit ecopetrol colombias effort to weaken the peso is aimed at costing ecopetrol us   million in additional payments a year the oil companys dollar credit costs measured by the reference notes due in  have increased to  compared to  on january  although the minister of finance mauricio cardenas authorized an issuance of up to us   billion last week the increase of  percentage points in the yields means that ecopetrol could pay us   million more per year for every us   billion that borrow colombias purchase of dollars and a drop in emerging market assets pushed the peso down from its highest level in  months and eased what cardenas called the mother of all problems the delay forces ecopetrol to pay higher credit costs to meet the us   billion of spending on production and exploration until  the increase in ecopetrols yields since january exceeds the average of  percentage points of increase in the bonds of similar maturity of state oil producers in mexico and brazil without a doubt ecopetrol will pay higher credit costs said juan david ballen an analyst at the operations firm alianza valores sa who added that a weaker peso clears the governments concerns and opens the possibility of addressing international markets  government attention the company has not set a date for the issue in the local and international markets ecopetrols press office said in an email response the company prepares the required authorizations both in colombia and abroad in order to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the market according to the statement the government is closely following the development of the exchange rate but is aware that ecopetrol has to continue with its expansion plan said public credit director michel janna in an email response ecopetrol and its subsidiaries seek to increase production  to  million barrels per day in  and  million barrels in  according to a presentation made this month by the company cardenas who sits on the companys ninemember board of directors in his capacity as one of the three government representatives had pressured the company to give up this year to sell global bonds to prevent the entry of dollars into the country from affecting the attempts from the government for weakening the peso which this year reached its highest level   per us dollar  on january  the strengthening of the

issue bonds in pesos before september to anticipate a possible turbulence in the markets due to the next meeting of the us federal reserve in which a cut in the monetary stimulus could be announced sources close to the operation said on wednesday and analysts eight experts consulted by reuters some of whom have attended meetings with ecopetrol in recent days estimated that the issue would be between   and   trillion us   and us   million although investors may be more interested in buying shortterm debt in an attempt to keep liquidity on hand ecopetrol is likely to issue longerterm papers around  years and beyond the sources said ecopetrol the largest company in the country and one of the largest oil companies in latin america received authorization from the financial superintendency on august  to issue bonds and commercial papers for up to   billion us   in the colombian securities market it is one hundred percent probable that the issue will be made before the end of the month it is almost a fact a source close to the oil companys issue who asked to keep its name in reserve told reuters additionally on august  the ministry of finance gave the oil company the green light to issue bonds in the international market for up to us   million market agents expect that such issuance will take place after the local operation ecopetrol is controlled by the government with an  stake while the remaining portion is placed on the local stock exchange the oil companys share rose  in wednesdays session to   an ecopetrol source specified that the date of the emissions has not yet been defined what you want is to have the permits and authorizations ready to go out at the time deemed appropriate the source explained to reuters the agents said that the issuance would seek to finance the investment plan of the oil company which amounts to us   million for  of which us   million were executed only in the first half of the year but the resources could also be used to transfer to the government in the remainder of the year part of the dividend payments of the profits generated in  in september the strong part of the dividend payments to the government begins explained andres bernal analyst at the casa de bolsa brokerage ecopetrol has almost   trillion left to pay the government and in available it does not have much as a percentage of total assets cash is at relatively low levels he added although analysts believe that the best time to carry out the issue was the first half of the year they consider that the next few weeks are optimal before the fed meeting on september  and  according to a reuters poll on wednesday the us federal reserve would announce at that meeting a decrease in its monetary stimulus plan which has motivated investors to seek shortterm assets to access liquidity more quickly the first four months of the year were the time now they are going to be paying a premium that basically obeys international conditions but if what is expected is that the trend in rates is an upward adjustment and they need the cash i would believe that they are already doing the issue said andres duarte head of economic studies at asesores en valores but this in any case implies greater profitability for whoever is going to buy the papers he added ecopetrol would issue bonds before september to reduce fed effectecopetrol announced its fourth hydrocarbon discovery of the year ecopetrol sa reported that it tested the presence of hydrocarbons in the guainiz  exploratory well located in the municipality of san carlos de guaroa located

four discoveries of the five exploratory wells drilled which represents an  success rate the department of meta is the epicenter of ecopetrols oil business due to the fact that about  of the companys crude production is concentrated there mainly due to the increase in the extraction of heavy crudewith the issuance of ecopetrol the local fixed income market would be reactivated market analysts

to the consumer price index in this placement the market demanded triple the amount placed since there were offers for more than   billion according to the analysis carried out by btg pactual ecopetrols experience in this market is favorable ecopetrols  reference classifies as the most liquid in history taking into account the volume traded four months after the auction although the companys bonds have also had to suffer from the latest rate movements on public debt it is considered that entering the market would undoubtedly reactivate the bond placement the participation of the public sector in the primary corporate debt market during  and so far in  has been low compared to previous years ecopetrols issuance would be a good opportunity to diversify investors portfolios

period to acquire the titles will be until  in the afternoon on august  as for the amount that the company will offer as the analysts had said it will reach a maximum of   million which corresponds to a total of  titles and that may be distributed in one or more issues however in the auction corresponding to the first batch of bonds resources for   million are sought it should not be forgotten that

up to   trillion which would be the global quota to issue as for the term of placement for these titles will be of a maximum of three years period that will begin to count from the moment in which the emission is made similarly the maturity period for these bonds will be indistinct for the four series that will be offered among which are    and  years at the same time the company stressed that for the calculation of interest the periodicity and the form of payment will be six months past due another important point is that the resources of this issue will be used  to finance ecopetrols

bancolombia bbva valores casa de bolsa davivalores profesionales de bolsa serfinco alianza valores global securities asesores en valores btg pactual and ultraburstiles as placement agents which will have a schedule that will be from  am to  pm and until  am for investors according to analysts ecopetrols issuance would have a wide demand due to the tradition that the company has had in the fixed income market and because it had been waiting issuance will seek to reactivate the fixed income market in a year in which the corporate fixed income market has not had the momentum that it had been presenting in previous years the high amount offered by ecopetrol added to the great interest it arouses in the values makes expectations pass because there is a great behavior on the part of investors who want to enter to buy the bonds of the oil companyecopetrol has ten hours to collect   million the corporate fixed income market which in the last year has not had the expected momentum will be reactivated from today with the issuance of ordinary bonds from the oil company ecopetrol that will go up to   million the above with the aim of financing its refinement and expansion projects interested individuals legal entities or companies may acquire these securities through the commissioning firms credicorp capital and corredores asociados as leading agents as well as through ultraburstiles serfinco global securities alianza valores among others who will serve as agents placers initially the company will offer papers for   million with the option of expanding   million more depending on the demand obtained each bond will have a value of   million which becomes the minimum to invest the oil company will issue titles of five to  years which will have according to experts projections rates between  and  for titles of five years  and  for   and  for  and for  the rate would be the most attractive calculated at  and  it should be remembered that these last two references would be aimed especially at longterm investors such as pension funds and insurance companies since they would be paid in  for analysts the bonds that would have the most demand would be those agreed to five years which despite having lower cutoff rates customers are mainly natural persons and they are very interested according to calculations taking as a reference a percentage of  for inflation and a placement rate of  a person who buys a bond   may have an effective annual return of  that is    it should be remembered that in  ecopetrol carried out its only placement of securities in local currency on that occasion the amount raised was   billion today the oil company has a debt quota of   billion which leaves the way open ecopetrol will always be an attractive issuer in the market for investors it has the backing of the government says diego usme analyst at ultraburstiles for alejandro salamanca an analyst at serfinco with the current situation of volatility it is possible that we will have more important demands on securities with shorter maturities finally according to analysts although it is not the best moment a successful issue is predicted  what do you need to buy bonds if you want to lend money to the largest oil company in the country you must have at least   which is the price of each of the corporate bonds and also have an account with one of the commission agents of bag that offer it likewise it is recommended to know what type of asset you are buying and to recognize the company that offers them  what type of debt is being issued the ordinary bonds that will be issued have a aaa rating granted by fitch ratings colombia sa the company will place   million with the possibility of overallotment in securities with maturities between  and  years in series indexed to the ipc and  fixed rate  what type of bond to buy for individuals and highly liquid portfolios the recommended series is the fiveyear series as it represents a good indexing opportunity in scenarios of increasing the cpi the  and  series may be more focused on structural portfolios that seek liquidity in the secondary market the  series is ideal for longterm investors  how has the oil company fared in its past emissions in the  issue the highest claims were at  and  years in the series of  and  years the claims were similar in amount   and   million respectively but it was also where less debt was issued within  years the placement reached   million being the most traded in the secondary market likewise better results were seen against companies in the same sector such as epm that issued at similar terms and with a better performance against public debt it will also be issued in dollars the government allowed ecopetrol to also borrow in dollars taking advantage of the fact that the us currency has remained stable near   and there is less risk of revaluing the peso significantly compared to current expectations thus the company received approval to issue up to us   billion in international markets through baml and morgan stanley opinions diego usme ultraburstiles analyst ecopetrol had not been issued since  the bonds are going to have significant demands although the market condition is not the best juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores i think that between the second and third week the papers could be coming out to the international market before the fed meeting daniel escobar fixed income analyst global securities the amount of the issue is moderate and i consider that there is potential in the market to do so the highest demand would be for fiveyearoldsecopetrol collected   million in four hours in just four hours ecopetrol managed to collect   million during the first batch of issuance of internal public debt bonds an initial amount that they offered to natural or legal persons and interested companies and that are part of the   billion quota it has in indebtedness the company the amount demanded by the interested parties was   trillion finally being the  securities the most acquired with a total of   million followed by the  series with an amount of   million while the  securities and after  years they collected a total of   million and   million respectively interest rates for the bonds issued range between  and  figures close to those predicted by analystsfitch confirms ecopetrols ratings and outlook fitch ratings maintained ecopetrols long and shortterm national ratings at aaa and  respectively likewise he left the perspective of the oil company in stable for the firm the notes reflect the close link with the performance of the nation the rating reflects the solid financial profile the increases in production and the adequate levels of reserves the companys growth strategy and capital investments are considered aggressive and could prove difficult to meet the company is expected to maintain a financial profile and credit metrics consistent with the assigned rating while implementing its growth strategy the rating agency said regarding the growth strategy he says that the goal of increasing crude oil production to  million barrels per day in  and increasing the refining capacity to  thousand barrels per day is a challenge for the company likewise it draws attention to the need to maintain an average reserve replacement index irr above  in order to maintain or increase its reserves while continuing to reach its production goal in  on the other hand  fitch points out that the rating could be lowered with a downgrade of the colombian sovereign rating an increase in leverage above fitchs expectations  times a weak operating performance that could result in a life of reserves of less than  years and  or a sustained decline in commodity prices ecopetrol has a good outlook to attract more resources through bonds the great expectation that had been generated around the ordinary bond auction that ecopetrol carried out yesterday finally confirmed that the company fell short in the allocation of the amount to be offered in the first lot although the company has permission to issue a total of   billion the oil company decided to be more timid and finally offered only   million which meant that   billion had been lost in the collection but when observing the results of the event ecopetrol finally placed  times what was initially offered which according to the oil companys report was a total of   million however the broad appetite presented by the companys event led to the placement of the total figure of   million which was the limit that had been established in the bylaws of the placement it should also be noted that the total demand that was registered reached   trillion in less time than was available since it only needed  hours from  am to  pm to reach the limit amount in this sense when making the breakdown between the  subseries of bonds that ecopetrol placed finally the highest demand was registered in the securities with a maturity of  years despite the fact that analysts had speculated that they would be those of  years the latter came to place a total figure of   million at a rate of ipc   ea while the demand was   million regarding the bonds with a maturity of  years   were awarded with a cutoff margin of ipc   ea while demand was   million on the other hand the  bonds which were the most demanded on the day managed to attract from the public a total of   million with an interest of ipc   ea while the figure that was requested was   million finally the subseries with a maturity of  years placed   million with an ipc rate   ea and the demand was   million according to juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores as expected the placement was a success it can be considered that it was a successful placement because despite the complicated situation of all emerging fixed income markets they managed to award everything that had already been raised at very attractive rates something that is interesting especially for investors who bought  even so daniel escobar fixed income analyst at global securities assured that more significant allocations had been expected in the shorter terms what we can think is that ecopetrol preferred to make a larger longterm placement and that is why it had an extra cost in those maturities specifically  years it was expected about  at the end it went up to  finally as ballen pointed out it is important to know that the great demand registered by ecopetrol represents a new vote of confidence for the company despite the poor financial results investors really like having any ecopetrol role in their portfolios and that ultimately translates into a new vote of confidence as to its strength thus this new issue of fixed income is a balm for the damaged market whose performance so far this year had been well below that recorded in previous years a new benchmark for the market in addition to the good news for the company that a high demand for the companys corporate securities has been achieved analysts say that this placement is good news for the entire fixed income market this as juan david ballen explained is due to the fact that from now on there will be two new references for the long curve that is with a longterm maturity with this investors can have a new point to look at to assess the profitability of these bonds the opinion juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores it was finally a successful placement since the company managed to place the amount that had been raised with good rates despite the bad moment of emerging fixed incomea reduction of   in gasoline would stop ecopetrols investment in exploration the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez assured that in the refining segment they are working at a loss and the approval of a project such as the one that seeks to reduce the price of gasoline by   would have a strong impact what has been seen is that about   reduction would be of the order of us   million a year that means not making investments in exploration or not making half of the investments in production with all that that means gutierrez highlighted he explained that currently due to the cost structure they are losing and that there are times when it is more expensive to produce diesel and gasoline than what is recognized in the ip he indicated that for example the margin of loss in the refinancing segment is in the order of   to   millionecopetrol grupo sura and grupo argos lead the colir index basket since

hours that is more than double the figure that was projected since the previous week the company made the presentation to foreign investors and it had planned to carry out the issue in two tranches

bofa merrill lynch and morgan stanley are the book keepers of the offer the funds raised will be used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures it should be remembered that at the end of last month the oil company issued bonds in the local market for a total of   million which also had an important demand that reached   trillion this issuance was the largest presented in the colombian market this year and the second largest by ecopetrol after the one carried out in  which was for an amount of   billion for the experts these results only show the good moment that the company is going through and the good position it has internationally its expansion plans in the local and foreign markets allow investors to see it as a solid company and as a good investment opportunity for now it is expected that there will be new issues in the fixed income market profits were   trillion ecopetrols net income in the first half of  amounted to   trillion and in the second

with a growth of  compared to the average production of the second quarter of  for the experts better figures are predicted at the end of the year opinions maria adelaida velasquez serfinco oil analyst what was seen in ecopetrols bond issuance in the international market demonstrated the appetite for the company it shows that it is solid and that it gives confidence  juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores despite the difficult environment in the fixed income market international investors confirmed their confidence in a company like ecopetrolpacific proposes to ecopetrol to extend the rubiales field operation contract pacific rubiales has just proposed to ecopetrol the extension of the association contract that the firms have in campo rubiales which ends in  to this end the canadian oil company plans to go from a current production of  barrels of crude per day to  to achieve this pacific would implement star technology with which it is expected to double the reserves of dense oil fields with a recovery factor of up to  the partnership contract between pacific rubiales and ecopetrol which expires on may   enters a development stage and the decision of who should operate it must be made well in advance pacific has asked ecopetrol to study the renewal of the contract as that they would set the technical parameters and social investment they have also proposed that they remain as operators and the change would enter as  owned by ecopetrol they have also decided that if this contract is not renewed they will proceed to deliver itpacifics proposal at campo rubiales may not be as attractive to ecopetrol up to  barrels of heavy crude oil a day could be produced by pacific rubiales if the association contract that the canadian oil company currently has with ecopetrol in the countrys largest heavy oil field is extended to do this pacific proposes that the state company allow it to implement the star secondary recovery technology in campo rubiales which currently produces  barrels a day it also proposes that the agreement that expires in  be extended this was pointed out by the vice president of corporate affairs federico restrepo solano who also said that this field which represents  of the total national oil production went from producing  barrels of oil per day to  in eight years of operation a few months ago the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez pemberthy made it clear that the stateowned company is capable of operating campo rubiales whose  api density crude is one of the heaviest on the market and whose processing technology is required tip according to hernando barrero president of acipet the local firm has the experience the track record and the qualified personnel it requires to continue with an efficient and successful operation of the field the heavy crude fields are not new to ecopetrol they have been producing this type of crude in various regions of the country such as in pastilla in meta  regarding whether ecopetrol has the necessary technology to lead rubiales the acipet executive said that the innovations are available internationally developed by research centers and can be accessed through contracts ecopetrol is currently carrying out the heavy crude improver project a facility that would allow the viscosity of heavy crude to be reduced so that diluent is no longer needed this project which is in the study stage would allow the company to reduce residual products by  and transform them into lighter crude components and recover up to almost us   per barrel of oil by  the company also expects that the modernization of the barrancabermeja refinery and the development of reficar increase the refining capacity of heavy crude german corredor director of the national universitys energy observatory pointed out that it would be absurd for ecopetrol to extend the contract because the company has the possibility of operating said field corredor added that the condition proposed by pacific is not sufficient since ecopetrol would be able to have the same production regarding star technology as luis andres rojas corporate vice president of production of the operating company explained to the colombia energia magazine with it it is expected to double the reserves of the dense oil fields with a recovery factor of up to   this project has been one of the great bets of pacific rubiales to increase the productivity of our wells since currently in the llanos region in the recovery part hopefully we are between  and  of the reserves leaving approximately  of the resources in the field it is a research project of approximately three years and one of application in the field  ecopetrols experience in heavy crudes today heavy crudes account for more than half of the companys production in  the general goal is to be recognized worldwide as a leader in heavy crude with  of its production under longterm contracts for international commercialization in addition to modernizing the two refineries for the processing of heavy crude today the company has almost  million barrels of heavy crude reserves and a potential that can reach up to  million barrels these crudes represent  of the firms total reserves and are located in the meta and magdalena medio departments on the border with antioquia boyaca and santander opinions hernando barrero president of acipet the heavy oil fields are not new for ecopetrol they have been producing heavy crude in various regions of the country javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol operating a field like rubiales is the same as operating those in castilla and chichimene and their productions are similarecopetrol and pacific rubiales shares were the most traded in the session the main indices of the stock market in colombia had a slight bearish behavior during their last session however the new proposal made by the canadian pacific rubiales to ecopetrol caused the shares to rebound and register as the most traded despite the fact that the petrominerales share rose to  to   achieving the most important rise during the session also the appreciation of pacific rubiales with  to   and celsia which rose  to   is also considered however the experts assure that the behavior during the day was not the best since the main actions had a negative variation for its part ecopetrol appreciated  to   and was the title with the highest number of trading during the day the canadians proposal for the renovation of the rubiales field and its new technological implementation helped make ecopetrols share the most negotiated for diana mosquera analyst at global securities despite this news the stock performance was bearish compared to the performance of the past days furthermore the pronouncement of the monetary stimulus schedule by the federal reserve will be forceful for the market he said on the other hand the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange colcap presented a decrease of  to  units in this same sense the  had a rise of  to  points and the igbc fell  to  units the share with the greatest decrease was the grupo argos preferred with a negative variation of  to   experts await the pronouncement of the federal reserve since this will define the behavior of the market at the end of the year and also that ecopetrol accepts the proposal by the canadian to be able to implement the new technology in  it is expected that this week investors will remain cautious with their movements in the stock marketecopetrol and aguila in the top  of the most valued brands one of the intangible assets in which companies invest the most is the brand which is why one of the signs of the importance of colombian companies in the region is the value that the consumer gives to the registration of firms brandz the ranking of the best brands carried out by the millward brown firm revealed the  most valued brands in latin america where colombia ranked number seven with the oil company ecopetrol the companys iguana obtained a valuation of us   million just two places down in box nine is the aguila de bavaria beer brand valued at us   million bancolombia also entered the ranking with us   ranked  poker with   in the  ladder followed by banco de bogota with  us   million banco popular in position  us   million success of  with us   million banco davivienda of  with us   million and finally banco de occidente with us   million for maria alejandra penalosa specialist in advertising marketing and director of fullenergy the fact that ecopetrol is among the top  latin brands is not fortunate but on the contrary it is the result of a strategic and constant work of communication and marketing to build a brand that has a strong impact on society especially with a positive image in the field of the environment the big surprise was the banks since  banks managed to enter the list for which they demonstrated that finances can be creative too to this the expert pointed out that once again it reaffirms the power of brands can transform any type of business into a great business that is recognized and loved regardless of the industrial sector from which it comes even so the leader that topped the list was mexico with the corona beer brand valued at us    million in second place was the mobile telephone brand telcel also mexican with a value of us   million and lastly the skol brand a danish beer with the right to be manufactured in brazil with us   billion the sector with the most presence on the list was spiritsecopetrol big loser with gasoline prices the mess between the ministry of finance and the constitutional court about how the new determination of the reference price of fuels will be not only creates uncertainty about how the final formula will be but also fear because in the event that the price stabilization fund de los combustibles fepc will stop working as it currently does the big losers from that decision will be ecopetrol and consumers this result is generated because the courts statement on the ruling which is not yet public would limit the governments capacities to determine the price of gasoline through the fepc according to the entity the mechanism with which the fund had been operating corresponded to that of a tribute and the only one authorized to legislate on this matter is congress despite this until now the fepc was in charge of stabilizing local fuel prices in such a way that these were not affected by increases or decreases in international prices now if we analyze the assumption in which fuels are determined by rising international prices and the bottom disappears on the one hand consumers would be the losers because the increase in prices would be transferred to the local price that the consumers will pay colombians in contrast as stated by the minister of finance mauricio cardenas to date the fund has a deficit of   trillion due to the occasions in which the international price has been above the local one and this has subsidized surpluses  to protect the pocket of colombians in a second scenario where prices are down and the fund does not stabilize the local reference ecopetrol would lose in terms of income currently it is estimated that about  of the price of gasoline goes to the oil company to finance oil exploration restructuring and exploitation and since local fuel was not exposed to market volatility the oil company could establish an average price to calculate its investments rafael barrera president of fendipetroleo explained that if the fund is eliminated what would happen is that ecopetrol when it sells cheaper due to the international price it will receive fewer profits and it will allocate fewer resources to increase the countrys reserves and the dream of becoming an oil power would be even further from being a reality for colombia whatever the decision it should not be to the detriment of ecopetrol which would put financial stability and exploratory activity at risk said the minister of mines amylkar acosta the balance with taxes although the lack of the fund will leave an impact there are other ways in which the formula can also be varied to reduce price increases among these as already mentioned is the reduction of taxes that as alvaro younes president of fedispetrol points out aggravates prices much more than international volatility for now both the government and the companies are awaiting the ruling and when it will begin to apply where will the funds resources come from one of the concerns that worries the minister of finance mauricio cardenas is where the resources will come from that will supply the deficit of   billion that the stabilization fund has in particular because as is known yesterday the court rejected the request of the portfolio manager to give him one year grace to apply the ruling and give the ministry time to define what the new mechanism of the fund will be in case of not disappear the government is expected to present a unified position within a week regarding the ruling on price regulation opinions mauricio cardenas minister of finance the stabilization fund is protecting the pockets of colombians if we put an end to that figure it will end up harming the country  amylkar acosta ministry of mines and energy whatever the decision it should not be to the detriment of ecopetrol which is the company of all colombians alvaro younes president of fedispetrol the impact of price volatility is not as serious as the inclusion of so many taxes in the reference price of gasolineecopetrol heads the list of companies with the greatest online information transparency the study revealed that the colombian companies with the greatest online information transparency are ecopetrol almacenes exito isagen inversiones argos and cementos argos being the hydrocarbon sectors and large commercial platforms the ones that stand out the most also in the group of ten companies are isa petrobras coca cola femsa exxonmobil corporation and falabella colombia followed by grupo epm bavaria grupo nutresa chevron petroleum carvajal codensa gas natural riopaila castilla lg electronis and cepsa colombia to complete the top  of the companies in the country with greater transparency in the digital world the researcher and author of the study called online information transparency in colombian companies diego catolico assured that every day new cases of business fraud and corruption appear at the national and international level in sectors as diverse as health construction  financial energy and education among others so that it was wanted to analyze how information transparency understood as the disclosure and disclosure of financial and nonfinancial information contributes to reducing the risks of fraud and corruption in the taking of decisions that affect the whole of society  which is why he highlighted the relevance of the research the results also show that the companies sample do not enjoy a high level of information transparency in the network the levels are intermediate and low thus  percent of the companies analyzed do not meet  percent of the aspects analyzed e information and communications have gained space in corporate strategies in order to generate relationships of trust with their users and consumers on the network most of the companies analyzed do not allow access to financial and nonfinancial information through their websites limiting the knowledge of the management carried out in this sense the evidence obtained shows according to catolico how the main colombian companies achieve precarious degrees of transparency that limit the availability and access to information affecting the possibility of control and  or decisionmaking that stakeholders have owners customers suppliers financial creditors employees state government and the community in general the study which was carried out during the first semester of  determined the degree of online information transparency from the investigation of  variables that recognized financial information that is accounting budgeting and control and nonfinancial which refers to content such as corporate governance social and environmental responsibility design and navigability on the website through the corporate web pages of  companies in the country catolico said that among the many causes that give rise to corruption in organizations are the absence of effective controls the lack of exemplary sanctions and the limitations on access to information so that the management of companies is fully visible being this last cause the one that motivates the approach of this type of studies  he pointed outecopetrol pays for the broken plates of violence the desire to take center stage of the subversive groups in colombia to try to be strong vigorous and continue negotiating their peace process has a major victim ecopetrol and its oil infrastructure which only in the first half of  had to invest  million pesos in repairs and has stopped producing  barrels of crude sources from the oil company told this newspaper that the number of barrels affected has hit the finances of ecopetrol and therefore the country by about  million dollars it should be clarified that we speak of deferred production not because it has been lost but rather that its exploitation has had to be postponed and deferred over time the two departments that have been most affected by the attacks are norte de santander specifically in the catatumbo area and the other critical place is putumayo through which the trasandino pipeline passes which allows oil to be evacuated from fields in the south of the country the same president of the republic juan manuel santos reiterated yesterday from caqueta that he will reinforce the strategy of fight against the farc and its attacks on the oil infrastructure following a wave of attacks in  the government announced the creation of six battalions to protect the oil and energy infrastructure in the departments of arauca catatumbo meta and putumayo in that year  attacks on the pipelines were registered an increase of  compared to  when  were reported according to statistics from the ministry of defense even the head of this ministerial portfolio juan carlos pinzon indicated earlier this year that the security strategy is complemented with the surveillance of unmanned aircraft drones to cover more ground and given the impossibility of putting a soldier in each section of the pipelines  according to figures from private consultants attacks against oil infrastructure have increased by  this year going from  attacks during the first  months of  to  in the same period of  union pessimism hernando barrero chavez executive director of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet expressed to this newspaper its concern with the wave of attacks because if an impartial comparison is made during the last  years security in oil exploitation areas has worsened attacks blockades protests in surrounding areas they are the common denominator now it is enough to analyze what happens with the cano limoncovenas oil pipeline which in  passed the year without any attacks and this year has  only last week there were  which forced the wells to be closed while the damage was repaired barrero chavez clarified as for the repair costs of the order of  million in the first half of this year the work and travel of personnel to the affected places are included however despite the fact that the number of attacks is higher the production affected was lower because the speed of response in the repair was improved a few years ago the cano limon covenas pipeline was repaired in  days and today it is being done between one and two days ecopetrol produces  barrels of oil per day compared to  which is what is stopped producing a figure that does not it ends up being around  of what is produced explained the ecopetrol source impact of the attacks given the increase in attacks they have been working hand in hand with the public forces to review their security strategy specifically in the  kilometers of the cano limoncovenas pipeline according to barrero chavez the cost of the impact by these attacks increases because the crude that is not produced stops being exported paying taxes and generating foreign exchange to the country in addition the one that is spilled generates an environmental impact of great proportions that ends up being incalculable since the monetary point of view for the security analyst jairo delgado retired general of the police and director of analysis of the institute of political science hernan echavarria it is a historical trend in the peace processes the guerrillas try to reach the negotiation strengthened with attacks and violence so that society demands dialogues  according to analysts three years ago there was talk of  blockades in colombia and this year we may be talking about  at the end of the year as for the prospects for improving the situation it is going to get complicated because what is sensed is that the dialogues in havana are not going anywhere the government does not have an easy time reaching an agreement there is an atmosphere skepticism said the executive director of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet explosions that are still being investigated the two recent explosions that affected ecopetrols infrastructure were registered two days ago one in magdalena medio in the cienaga del opon district of barrancabermeja and the other explosion occurred in the las brisas district of cantagallo south of bolivar there according to preliminary knowledge a section of the gas pipeline exploded ecopetrol sources indicated yesterday that they were gathering more details of the damage to be repaired likewise the police and military authorities have not yet delivered an official report because they have not yet been able to establish whether it is a criminal act or was something accidental effect of the attacks  incalculable environmental damage in the areas surrounding the attacks flora and fauna is destroyed  in addition water sources aqueducts and human settlements are affected  putumayo with  attacks is the department most affected by the attacks in ecopetrol and pdvsa signed a gas pipeline connection it is about the consolidation of a memorandum of understanding for the connection between the cano limon and guasitas gas pipeline of ecopetrol and pdvsa whose purpose is to strengthen the infrastructure of the gas distribution networks the decision was made yesterday in the binational commission colombiavenezuela led by foreign minister maria angela holguin and her venezuelan

announced a strong mobilization of soldiers and police in order to guarantee safetyecopetrol did not keep the campo libra operation the countrys main oil company ecopetrol could not keep the operation of the libra field which brazil auctioned today instead the consortium led by petrobras which also includes total sa royal dutch shell plc and the asian companies china national petroleum corp and cnooc kept the field offshore to this bid ecopetrol had joined with the expectation of keeping the field with the largest reserves in brazil which were some  meters deep according to the calculations of the tender it is estimated that the field will be able to produce  million barrels of crude the current level in which the country is that is why the acquisition of ecopetrol was intended to be a national commitment to increase the countrys reserves which currently reach some  million barrels of oil investments on the other hand ecopetrol announced that to date its contracts reach more than   billion in the last nine months of the year among these the oil company estimated  were made with national suppliers this means that as of september ecopetrol did business with domestic suppliers for   billion of which   billion was with regional and local suppliers in the same period contracting with foreign suppliers amounted to   billion reported the oil companyecopetrol did not keep the

more than attractive because according to the calculations of the offer it is estimated that the field will be able to produce  million barrels of oil while during the last month the country did not reach one million barrels per day hiring on the other hand yesterday ecopetrol announced that its hiring reached more than   billion in the last nine months of the year among these the oil company estimated  were made with national suppliers thereby contributing to the development of the national economy this means that as of september ecopetrol did business with national suppliers for   billion of which   billion was with regional and local suppliers in the same period contracting with foreign suppliers amounted to   million  reported the oil companygas natural will contract with chevron equion and ecopetrol in order to guarantee the supply of natural gas gases de occidente entered into natural gas supply contracts for a period of five years with the productiontrading companies ecopetrol equion and chevronecopetrol would have increased its revenues  tomorrow the market will know the financial results of the largest company in colombia ecopetrol of which millions of citizens are partners and they expect the oil company to show positive results since the value of future dividends is determined from there an lr survey shows that the outlook is positive and that shareholders can rest assured that there will be growth even if it is lower according to market projections the oil company will report a positive evolution that could occur in revenues as a result of both oil prices and the evolution of the exchange rate on the other hand and according to the increase in production in the country for the months of july august and the decline in september analysts estimate that for this third quarter of the year the net profit will be an average of   trillion which represents an increase of  when compared to the results of the second quarter likewise experts consider that the companys operating income will be around   billion that is  more than the previous quarter when an amount of   billion was reported in line with the higher production of heavy crude oil the lower international prices of hydrocarbons and the expected increase in costs when looking at the annual variation there will be an increase of  compared to the income registered in the same period of  which was   billion according to diego franco an analyst for asesoria e inversiones the data for this period looks more favorable but i dont see them as surprising these would be the first results with another face since the previous periods have disappointed but the fact of having a higher oil price is going to favor the company  it is worth noting that the highest revenue figure reported so far by ecopetrol is   billion corresponding to the last quarter of  for omar escorcia an analyst at asesores en valores we consider that the positive effect that good results this period would be limited by a production report of around  barrels per day under this hypothesis the average production for the first nine months of the year would be  barrels less than the goal of  although at this point ecopetrol could still show a rebound in the fourth quarter of the year and thus meet its goal  likewise for fabian perdomo stocks and securities analyst the corporate results of the company for this quarter will be good although they will not surprise the market in a significant way we believe that production should have been around  barrels a figure that allows it to reach the average the price can be corrected but there is not a very strong behavior neither upwards nor downwards  it should be noted that during the first semester of  production grew by  compared to the same period of  on the other hand according to serfinco estimates it is important to note that despite the increase in income margins they will be affected by the shutdown of unit  of the barrancabermeja refinery starting in september thus the market will keep the action stable and investors will be able to rest easy first semester reported important findings during the first two quarters of the year the company reported important discoveries one of them was that of hydrocarbons in the department of meta with  participation this being the third finding of ecopetrol in  also subordinate hocol drilled a successful exploratory well during the first half of the year which according to analysts improves results regarding the stability of oil prices brent the oil company has been negotiating its oil tied to this marker and to the maya the first of them would be at a price of us   per barrel opinions omar escorcia analyst of asesores en valores the results for the third quarter will be positive although they will not show very strong behaviors they will be better than in previous periods  diego franco investment advisory analyst i do not see surprising results but they are favorable and they would be the first results with another face since the others have disappointed diego usme ultraburstiles analyst for the next period it is expected that the oil company will have strategies to improve costs and increase importsecopetrol exceeded market expectations the main oil company in the country ecopetrol last night reported its results for the quarter which registered a  increase in net profit compared to the second quarter of  reaching   billion they are  more than the same period last year proof of its recovery and that it exceeds market expectations ebitda in the third quarter of  increased  compared to the same period in  the ebitda margin was  compared to  in the third quarter of the previous year in addition it remained at  for the januaryseptember period in the third quarter of  we obtained very positive operating and financial results supported by growing production levels favorable hydrocarbon prices and the peso  dollar exchange rate however we continue to face a challenging environment particularly due to attacks on the transport infrastructure and the blockades of some communities to the operation  says javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol financial results for the third quarter were the best in the last six quarters although they are signs of recovery if you look at the net profit between januaryseptember  trillion it fell  it has not yet reached the rate of  in terms of operating income in the third quarter of  they registered an increase of  exceeding the market estimate by one percentage point they reached   trillion more than the   trillion estimated by analysts in the lr survey this despite the  reduction in the average sale price due to higher crude oil sales volumes  barrels per day and the devaluation in the exchange rate cost of sales for the third quarter grew  compared to the same period in  as a result of variable costs which increased  divided into the cost of transportation of hydrocarbons purchases of crude gas and products and amortization costs and field depletion operating expenses in the julyseptember period showed a  decrease compared to the same period of the previous year we continue to develop cost control initiatives in all segments of the operation mainly in relation to well maintenance energy consumption supply and maintenance of refineries says gutierrez regarding crude oil production ecopetrol reached a record level of  barrels of oil per day with a growth of  compared to the third quarter of  between januaryseptember  the average production was  kboed with growth  compared to the previous year better results in the last seven quarters according to the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez the main oil company in the country registered the best results due to its operating income divided into higher volumes of crude oil sales and to the devaluation in the exchange rate and for variable costs this represented in the increase of  million barrels of inventories at the end of the ninth month of the year and its amortization and depletion costs in fields such as rubiales quifa castilla and chichime the opinion javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol we obtained the best financial results of the last six quarters and i highlight the growth in net income of ecopetrol is the most admired company in the country according to a study with  ecopetrol was the company most

parliamentarians from the last legislature among other issuesanif asks to speed up the sale of isagen and  of ecopetrol to pay for the bogota metro after  years of waiting bogota would already have the real possibility of having a heavy subway however the question arises where the resources of the national government will come from to finance it the national association of financial institutions anif proposes to finance this project with additional resources that could result from the sale of  of isagen and from reviving the proposal to sell  of ecopetrol in the next two years sergio clavijo president of anif affirmed that extraordinary resources are needed for this type of project since the government has a tight budget whose spending ceiling is provided by the fiscal rule for this reason it would need a reform to the rule because at this moment it does not have space for more investment expenses the district and the government are in charge of financing this project which will begin construction in  bogota has already approved   million in its debt quota for the construction of the first line the government has budgeted under the conpes  to allocate the sum of   million from  and for  years for the projects of the comprehensive mobility program of the capital region which includes the metro the district is still negotiating with the ministry of transportation and the ministry of finance what part of that sum is destined for the work or if the entire amount will be for the metro hence anifs suggestion to find different resources to finance a work the size of the metro currently the sale of isagen has accelerated thanks to the publication of the decree that increased the base price from   to   per share that is there is now a clear way to publish the public offering notice for the solidarity sector which will be the first in being able to acquire the assets of the electricity company although with a limit of  of the total the minister of finance mauricio cardenas has said that the disposal of the energy company will occur despite the four lawsuits that have been filed against it among which is that of former president alvaro uribe which was expanded after the price increase and two from the tax justice network which are submitted to the council of state he has also indicated that the resources raised by the sale about   billion will be the capital of the national infrastructure fund which will be in charge of financing the riskiest infrastructure projects in the country such as the prosperity highways  among others of the fourth generation concessions on the other hand the sale of an additional  of ecopetrol was stopped two years ago because that idea was not sold in congress since there was not a good environment to accept the sale at that time the money that would be raised from the sale would go to the road infrastructure affected by the  winter wave congress entered the debate saying that the goose that laid the golden eggs could not be sold this percentage is different from the remaining  that ecopetrol still has to issue new shares that is why the government came up with selling isagen first than ecopetrol the document delivered by anif the heavy bogota metro when and how says that the government would start financing  of the project in figures it would speak of   million annually for the next three years anifs calculations are not so wrong with the annual budget allocated to conpes clavijo called for the modification of the fiscal rule in order to finance the metro said modification would be greater fiscal discipline in spending and higher structural tax collections with these changes and the inclusion of golden rules infrastructure spending could be enabled the first line worries within the conclusions of the document anifs concern about the structuring of the first line is also highlighted the structuring is still not clear at the detailed engineering level and the mayors office itself is taking more time than it should to structure the bogota metro company the layout of the first metro line plm is subject to the study that was delivered to the  consortium which is made up of the colombian firm cano jimenez and the spanish euroestudios and idom the line would cover from calle  to the portal de the americas if this is the case the progress according to anif in vehicle decongestion of the transmilenio nortecaracasdecima corridor would be little the real value of the megaproject will be delivered in july  the deadline for the delivery of the third stage of the  consortium study the analysis will show what is the state of the land for the construction of the rails type of rail and train that a city like bogota needs as well as the spaces to carry out its operation control center and stations the cost of the study was   billion anif stressed that the decision is pending if the construction to calle  with carrera novena will be final or if it will extend to calle  the association mentions a study by the firm steer davies gleave that warns that the cedritos area will increase its population in  new inhabitants during  and  and hence the initiative to expand the metro to calle  with carrera novena is the most relevant to respond to concerns about the structuring of the plm why think about a second metro line the studies of the spanish company sener designed four lines of the bogota metro anif stressed that it is already necessary to think about the feasibility studies of the second line because it would help to decongest the north of the city this will have to cross the western edge starting with calle  that would connect with the first line of the metro continue along suba and finally connect with the portal de las americas within the design of the second line multimodal transmilenio stations are proposed on the main lines of avenida suba calle  and calle  opinions sergio clavijo president of anif the government has a very tight budget it needs different money than today a day to finance a work like the bogota metro at this time they would not have room for investment expenses  german alfonso prieto director of the transportation management technology program at u jorge tadeo the first line of the subway will move  of the trips the reorganization of the sitp that will transport more people is a higher priority at this time financial efforts should focus on consolidating it what the attacks have taken from ecopetrol the attacks on the pipeline network are leaving greater negative effects on crude oil production than those recorded last year only in the case of ecopetrol the accounts of what has been stopped selling to date amount to at least us   million compared to us   million that were not marketed in all of  estimates correspond to different variables the first of them the most recent is the approximate one for  about  barrels of oil per day bdp deferred that the company has stopped selling as a result as of october  there were more than  million barrels of oil that were either dammed or lost in spills for this amount the main oil company in the country estimates the sales that could be made at a price of us   per barrel which is the base estimated by ecopetrol in its budget but the truth is that the international price of oil wti has been between us   and us   which would lead to the amount of crude that has not been commercialized in  to exceed us   million estimated with the base price and reach about us   million we view the attacks with deep concern because in addition to the economic losses there is an impact on the international business environment insecurity is generated among investors who might believe that they will not meet their production goals said hernando barrero president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet and it is that this years scenario continued and grew compared to the results of  only in that period according to the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez some  bdp were accumulated deferred on account of the attacks as a consequence about  million barrels were not marketed at the end of  the good news in this scenario is that sales can be resumed and both the oil company and the state can recover the income from production for this it will be in the hands of ecopetrol to generate the strategy to accelerate the process and to be able to commercialize the crude this year the negative side according to the company is that there are a total of  barrels that were lost due to spills and that can no longer be recovered and although this is a small figure compared to national production it is estimated that the losses can be between us   and us    of production affected ecopetrols oil production during the first semester remained at an average of  bdp and amounted to about  bdp in the last quarter against this estimate the effects of the attacks on the oil pipelines only affect  of production which is why as stated by the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta the production goal for the end of  would not be revised thanks to this there is still no economic fear in the sector and both companies and the government hope that no more attacks will be repeated that will put at risk not only this years goal but also the communities that are affected by the oil spill  the consequences of the attacks on the communities in addition to the economic results and the impact on the international image of the country and the sector there are also the social effects that the attacks leave on the communities in particular because spills can damage natural resource sources such as water which goes to entire municipalities and it is complicated not only by the issue of the purification that the waters require to avoid diseases among the population but also by the recessions that must be made in public services when you have the opportunity to see the aftermath of an attack and the enormous damage done to the environment you want to cry because it is nonsense said the president of acipet hernando barrero the opinion hernando barrero president of acipet the government must continue working tirelessly to see how it can reduce these attacks and see what realignments can be made to the safety netecopetrol receives third biofuel patent in colombia the superintendency of industry and commerce of colombia granted ecopetrol sa an investment patent for a technology that will allow the generation of biofuels that will govern as the eighth patent granted to the company in the course of  with this new patent a process called process to hydrotreat vegetable oil mixed with heavy fractions of petroleum  the aim is to refine vegetable oils and heavy fractions of petroleum such as diesel fuel in the same process this process will serve to take advantage of the installed capacity in the refineries since it will compensate the natural oil of vegetable origin with those derived from the refining processes this is the third patent related to biofuel that is given to ecopetrol which already has those of bioketane and bioparaffinsecopetrol appoints a new corporate vice president the oil company ecopetrol sa informed that magda manosalva will position herself as the new corporate vice president of finance for the company the executive has an undergraduate degree in economics and a masters degree in economics from the national university of colombia in turn he studied finance at the harvard extension school before reaching this position he served as financial and administrative vice president of reficar sa between february  and october  and between september  and february  he held the position of head of the treasury unit of ecopetrol sa this appointment occurs after that ecopetrols share fell by  and was below   according to the bloomberg agency report in which it was reported that said company would be evaluating the option of issuing shares to finance the budget of ecopetrol and isagen to the sway of the ads when a person buys shares they must take into account that their profitability will vary due to factors such as market rumors corporate news decisions of the main shareholders activity of foreign exchanges among others reason why the swing of the actions is the daily life of the investors although all securities are volatile there are some that by their nature may be more affected such is the case of shares that belong to joint ventures that is they have private and state capital in this case the information that the market knows usually comes from different sources not just from company presidents this is the case of the shares of ecopetrol isagen etb ebb among others which in recent years have had large fluctuations due to announcements or statements by executives and public officials for maria adelaida velasquez senior equity analyst at serfinco in general the equity market is susceptible to all the information that flows however in the shares that have state participation the information is usually a little more disorganized because the private companies try to be more reserved with their advertisements while the others what is known may come from other sources  one characteristic that the analyst highlights is that in many cases the joint ventures must report where they get the money from which is why congress the ministry among other institutions end up giving the information that moves the action the most recent case is that of the ecopetrol share which in two days managed to drop  and be close to the   floor due to a misinterpretation of the statements of its president javier gutierrez the news of a possible issue caused the share to fall and then with a clarification from the company and the finance minister himself the market normalized and the share rose again but this is not the only cause of a movement when it comes to attacks on the oil infrastructure or the price of fuels which are government and company issues this has an impact on the share price explained the serfinco analyst so there are several aspects that make the action move something similar happens with other species for example with isagen whose title has been changing according to the governments decisions to increase the price of the sale of shares or due to information about its operation in hydroelectric plants perhaps the case that is most remembered is that of the etb and eeb when the mayor of bogota gustavo petro said that there were plans to merge the companies which led the titles to fall more than  the news about isagen has nothing to do with the corporate part of the company but with the states need for resources which leads it to sell its stake now the expectation is who will be the new owner said omar escorcia stock analyst at asesores en valores one recommendation for investors is that they always keep company fundamentals in mind not only based on rumors buying or selling decisions must be made but the behavior of the company in terms of dividends and financial results is very important thus although all the shares vary their price depending on the market news it cannot be denied that these shares have a component of greater volatility due to their characteristics investors look for more information behind an upward or downward correction in a stock what you have is the need to be well informed maria adelaida velasquez assured that the idea is to give the correct messages to those investors who do not have access to this daily monitoring of the shares i believe that the most important thing is to report things correctly both from analysts and from the media for his part omar escorcia said that people have to be clear about how the company is growing as such in isagen the price is adjusted to what the government says in the case of ecopetrol it has to see the short and long term  it is not just a rumor but the fundamentals of a company the opinion omar escorcia analyst of asesores en valores whenever a share issue is announced there is a fall in the share the information that came out on bloomberg created a rumor that was cleared upecopetrol will continue to produce despite cheaper gasoline with the drop in the price of gasoline the debate on the business model to be followed by ecopetrol is revived in the energy sector that is if it subsidizes gasoline prices so that they reach the final consumer lower or if it maintains its development to produce more oil however experts pointed out that if ecopetrol takes the subsidy model it must buy gasoline at international prices and if final user rates are lowered it would mean less income for the company which would have to stop investing resources to maintain its production but nel benjumea vice dean of the national universitys mining faculty said that the gasoline formula must be reviewed as it greatly influences the final price despite this the expert added that ecopetrol should not subsidize but should think about earning less from the sale that is the efficiency of production for his part german corredor director of the national university energy observatory said that if the cost of production of the oil company were lower it could be an important factor to consider subsidizing what matters here is that the cost of selling abroad is higher and it is very difficult to calculate subsidies and there is a clear policy of what we want in the country i believe that he is not going to subsidize because he thinks about continuing to earn money if a company is so useful it is not going to stop doing it  finally alvaro younes president of fedispetrol said that although the outlook is confusing due to the competition from biofuels ecopetrol would continue to dedicate itself to the activity that has given it such profitability ecopetrol receives its eighth patent of the year the superintendency of industry and commerce of colombia recently granted ecopetrol an invention patent for a technology that allows the generation of biofuels with it vegetable oils and heavy petroleum fractions such as diesel fuel can be refined in the same process this is the eighth patent received by the company in ecopetrol workers protest in campo rubiales according to what was announced by pacific rubiales since yesterday several ecopetrol transporters have moved tank cars near the rubiales field and puerto gaitan to block the access roads to the fields the roads were in fact given as a protest mechanism of the workers who estimate that with the entry into operation of the bicentennial pipeline the transport of crude oil by tank cars is reduced by up to  and labor demand is affected despite this the oil company points out that precisely to avoid the demonstrations they announced to the contractors months in advance that transport by pipeline would reduce the demand for tank cars but the companies took no action as a result about  workers are blocked and have not been able to proceed with the loading and transportation of crudeecopetrol and cencosud continue to be the most traded shares in mila staying in the ranking of the most traded shares in the latin american integrated market mila is clear evidence that ecopetrol and cencosud sa have taken advantage of the advantages and benefits offered by stock market integration in this sense the results as of october  showed that the leader in mila is the colombian oil company ecopetrol with us   million showing important levels in its negotiation followed by cencosud sa with us   million and in third place was located the retail company falabella with an amount of us   million for the global securities analyst diana mosquera at that time the good behavior was registered because ecopetrol presented a recovery in its price a striking situation for foreign investors and makes its title have a greater participation expanding the panorama the fourth place went to the chilean company afp cuprum which registered a trading amount of us   million followed by enersis sa with us   million latam airlines group with us   million and sociedad quimica y minera de chile us   million this good individual result of the companies did not favor the total volume traded of the mila since during the tenth month of the year it registered us

development ecopetrol will increase the production of the cano sur este block to  barrels per day by  the countrys largest oil company ecopetrol reported that with the commercialization of the cano sur este block the company foresees a development plan in which to increase the production of  to  barrels per day in  drill  development wells and invest us   million the production of this field will be  by ecopetrol once this declaration of commerciality has been made the commercial exploitation phase of the block begins which covers an area of  hectares the extension of cano sur este corresponds to  of the total of the cano sur block  hectares which continues to be explored by ecopetrol for the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez this commerciality which contributes to achieving ecopetrols goals of producing one million clean barrels in  and which is one of the fruits of the exploratory campaign in which we have been working hard since past decade the results obtained in cano sur confirm the potential of this area in heavy crude one of the focuses of the companys strategy  as of november  in the cano sur este block  wells had been drilled between exploratory stratigraphic and delimiters cumulative production since may  when the first discovery was made amounts to  barrels of crude with a gravity of  apiecopetrols optimism for the cano sur block is still not enough for the reserves without a doubt increasing ecopetrols production will always be good news for colombians even so for the market the efforts of the oil company are still not enough for there to be a significant effect on the challenge of increasing reserves yesterday the main oil company in the country declared the commerciality of the cano sur este block located in meta in other words after exploration in the area and tests to verify its crude capacity they already have the certainty that this will be a sustainable area for oil production this shows us that ecopetrol and the government continue working to maintain the supply said the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez who added that the current production capacity of the block is about  average daily barrels of oil bpdp and would spend to around  bpdp in  but the challenge that now worries the sector the most is the proven reserves that will guarantee colombias production capacity in the coming years faced with this line gutierrez pointed out that some  million barrels would be added to ecopetrols reserves which could increase the estimated period for national reserves which today are  years but he clarified that it is still not clear how long it would be in contrast the market position is not as optimistic as that of the company why because the reserves which estimate with certainty how much crude there is in the ground to be exploited a year lose about  million barrels that the country consumes to maintain the balance companies should guarantee a production that is enough to replace the crude extracted from the ground and that in turn leaves an additional for national reserves today these have about  million barrels this year about  million barrels will be consumed and the company would add about  million it would be missing but with the discoveries of  between colombia and abroad ecopetrol could replace the oil extracted whether that is enough or not will only be known until another year for now the company and the market cannot estimate it explained nicolas norena an analyst at serfinco in addition to this position andres escobar president of econcept assured that those barrels that ecopetrol will add little move the needle it is good news but we consume more than  million barrels a year so the figure is not much  the good news is that the company has identified some  million units of original crude in the area which means that the total to be added to reserves could increase considerably in the coming years the share rises although it will still be necessary to wait until the oil company defines the effect of crude oil on reserves the ecopetrol share did see the good moment of this announcement yesterday during the day the title was the most traded and closed at   a variation of  and it is not for less because although reserves do not increase in the short term production will increase by  when it reaches  bpdp growth would be  as stated by mauricio cardenas minister of finance during this year the average production per day has remained at one million barrels despite the attacks on the pipelines which have discounted about  of the oil companys production in other words about  bpdp have stopped being commercialized for now the new point in the sights is that the national environmental licensing authority anla gives the authorization to start with the required constructions in  oil company will publish an investment plan in two weeks to strengthen the development plan of the eastern zone from the cano sur block the oil company will allocate some us   million in a fiveyear program which will be clarified in the next  days thanks to these the entity will advance in the construction of storage tanks and other infrastructure facilities on the surface also there will be an amount earmarked for another  wells in addition to the  that are already drilled and activities for protection in social aspects opinions javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol the results obtained in cano sur confirm the potential of this area in heavy crude one of the focuses of the companys strategy nicolas norena equity analyst at serfinco it will always be good news that ecopetrol makes discoveries and adds to reserves but this announcement does not change the market positionecopetrol and enbridge are considering participating in the pacific pipeline project ecopetrol sa and enbridge inc are among the group of companies that are considering the project to build the pipeline that seeks to link the eastern plains with the pacific coast as the country is heading to export to asian markets the gas pipeline would have a potential capacity of  to  barrels per day and would require an investment of around   billion said camilo marulanda cenit chief ecopetrols transportation subsidiary the government targets india and china as key markets for future oil exports the collaboration agreement for the pipeline made about six months ago was signed by firms such as pacific rubiales units of talisman energy inc enbridge and colombia interconectado electrica sa esp cenit said the group is evaluating the viability how much it would cost if there is enough volume the route and the necessary investments marulanda said in a telephone interview it is a potential option in the future enbridge canadas largest pipeline operator said it is discussing the possibilities and requirements for the pipeline with the colombian government and refineries they are in early stages said graham white a spokesman for enbridge adding that there are no construction dates no formal proposals or timelines colombia ships most of its oil through the port of covenas according to ecopetrols websiteecopetrol and talisman announce commercial viability of oil field the oil company ecopetrol and the canadian talisman announced the commercial viability of the colombian akacias field in the  block located in the southeast of the country which will have investments of more than us   billion between  and  the  block in the department of meta in which ecopetrol owns a  stake and talisman the remaining  has an estimated original crude oil at the site of  million barrels meanwhile the akacias field has proven reserves of  million barrels of crude oil and the companies forecast a production of  average barrels per day bpd in  and  bpd in ecopetrol will increase its production  in three years due to new blocks thanks to the two commerciality declarations that ecopetrol recently made in its blocks it is expected that crude oil production will grow close to  in the next three years thanks to these measures the countrys main oil company expects to obtain another  average barrels of oil per day bpdp which in  would be added to the one million barrels that colombia already produces today but this result would occur through the work carried out in two areas located in the meta the first batch would arrive with the akacias area which is part of the  block there after a period of tests to establish a production potential yesterday the company declared commerciality in the area in which nine wells have been drilled in this way ecopetrol and its partner talisman who by contract has  are betting on the sustained development of this area as part of the strategy the oil company expects that the obtaining of crude oil will go from about  bpdp to  bpdp by the end of  this news is important for colombia at a time when our greatest concern is precisely to incorporate new reserves to the ones we already have said the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta along these lines the results in the area also allow us to see that the company will initially add some  million barrels to the companys reserves these of course will benefit the national level of reserves that today give for about seven years and that it is urgent to increase and although this scenario has generated criticism in recent years there is already optimism because once oil is discovered and the fields are developed the panorama continues to improve today we are talking about a small production but the level of proven reserves increases with the development of the fields said hernando barrero president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet the good news from akacias was added to the declaration that ecopetrol made about the cano sur este block last week through this area which the oil company manages  another  bpdp would be added to  currently thanks to the tests carried out in the area production reaches about  bpdp to this is added that the company would add some  million barrels to reserves to continue increasing the national level opinions hernando barrero president of acipet the outlook continues to improve today we are talking about a small production but the level of proven reserves increases with the development of the fields  javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol

this amount amounted to us   million as on previous occasions the exploitation of crude oil together with the exploration in the fields will take most of ecopetrols investments these amounts would be destined mainly to the fields in the eastern plains among which cano sur and  stand out the company recently declared the commerciality of two areas that have an oil production potential for the next few years cano sur este and akacias both news were received with optimism by the market because the country will have the possibility of increasing its proven reserves thanks to the development of the

announcement the resources will also be to execute projects in which they have had delays said diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles as part of these pending tasks usme estimates this years execution leaves them  that they would not complete in the third quarter that part would remain for   with these resources the company also strengthens its strategy of producing one million clean barrels in  and  million in  as gutierrez pointed out if the country successfully achieves this goal and achieves good exploration results it could guarantee an increase in reserves and colombia would

 average barrels per day of oil bpdp which it reached in the third quarter to  bpdp in  according to omar escorcia analyst at asesores en valores  this drop in the stock could be due to low

mantilla this year we will be able to tell the company that we returned in profits around five times the budget assigned to us we had a budget of us   million and we returned us   million in savings and in higher income for the company  the benefits that were paid to ecopetrol occurred in fields such as exploration production refining environment biofuel and transportation one of the examples of these benefits occurred with the subandean basins project in which information was provided for the declaration of commerciality of the acacias area located in meta which allowed an initial incorporation of reserves in the order of  million euros barrels on the other hand through the construction of a laboratory new technology such as air injection is to be implemented to recover a

million for the following yearel sena ecopetrol invias and fenalco will have teleworkers for next year one of the governments goals is to link more than  organizations to telework programs by  some of the entities that are being monitored in this process are the national learning service sena ecopetrol the national highways institute invias and the national federation of traders fenalco which did not reach enter the program this year the telework advisory commission the entity in charge of providing this support made a diagnosis of the organizations and is supporting them in the process of formalizing and training future teleworkers it only remains to sign the document in which the companies commit to the program maria patricia guzman director of cotelco bogota assures that teleworking is a valid option for companies in those positions in which human talent does not necessarily have to be providing a service directly to the public there are already  teleworkers in the country of this number in bogota there are around  in cali  and in medellin  telework has been consolidated little by little progress has been made towards a culture its implementation training now the challenge is the followup and consolidation of this policy  assured the minister of labor rafael pardo this portfolio is also betting on a teleworking conpes for  with which the government intends that several entities commit to create a good space for remote work which helps create new jobs the consolidation of an information system for the registration of teleworkers is another of the governments letters for next year the method will make it possible to identify which are the sectors with the highest number of teleworkers and who have the capacity to do so it will serve for the surveillance and control of the standards of this model the ministry of information and communication technologies mintic will initiate training programs with certification in teleworking skills this policy will generate employment and selfemployment and reduce the unemployment rate in these regions through the use of ict tools and training processes for teleworking said the entity with teleworking companies

statement issued by the oil company yesterday clarifying the financing for its investment plan had a good reception in the market and at the end of the session its titles achieved a rise of  to reach   now the company is expected to take advantage of that buyer appetite given the current price at a low of  and manage to correct the lost course a boost that could cause it to exceed   again the upward movement is due to the clarification of how the us   million plan will be made which dispels doubts about a possible share issue now it is expected to recover the lost ground and reach up to   per title says jose dario lozano head of shares at alianza valores to the extent that the results are consolidated the stock will recover its price the important thing is to look at the fundamentals of the company and ecopetrol continues to be consolidated to continue growing in its production  as stated by the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez uncertainty about a possible share issue as a financing mechanism was the main reason that punished ecopetrols securities in recent weeks as the expert adds that fear was increased with a citibank report that assured that it would need to issue shares or reduce the dividend but not everyone has a positive opinion of the oil companys action it is true that temporarily a rebound in the stock will be seen thanks to the new information but we do not believe that it will be a trigger for it to register a great growth what we do see is that the news supports the falls says omar escorcia equity analyst at asesores en valores furthermore experts believe that the lower volume traded in december and at the beginning of the year may slow down the pace of recovery how is the investment financed the fall in the shares occurred as a result of the oil company publishing its investment plan in which of those us   million us   million will be allocated for investments in projects of the parent company and the remaining us   million in subordinates the problem arose because the company did not specify where it was going to get the money which led to speculation about a possible issue however ecopetrol made it clear that the money will come from cash generation financing obtained in  disinvestment in nonstrategic assets and additional financing now another point is in which assets ecopetrol will divest the company is a shareholder of empresa de energia de bogota with a  stake and isa you have to see which company does it and if it is in eeb see if it is enough for what you need everything will have an impact on the action says lozano it is not yet clear how the performance of its titles will be but for now it was able to catch some fresh air by the end of  contrucciones el condor the most valued of the day in the last session the share of construcciones el condor presented the highest increase of  up to   behind the preferred share of bancolombia was located with an appreciation of  to   meanwhile on the negative side the one that reflected the worst performance was fabricato falling  to   followed by isa which lost  to   as for the main indices of the colombian stock exchange they closed positive thus the colcap ended with a rise of  to  units the igbc rose  to  points and finally the  rose  to end at  integers opinions jose dario lozano head of shares of alianza valores it is expected that after the announcement the ecopetrol share will regain lost ground and after the increases the securities could reach  ecopetrol shares start the week with a  drop the share of the largest oil company in the country ecopetrol has not recovered ground during the morning the title has presented a decrease of  in its price reaching   in recent days the stock has presented a not very favorable behavior it should be remembered that after publishing its investment plan for this year the company began to have declines in the stock marketthey discover an alleged case of corruption in ecopetrol the government of colombia ecopetrol and the us department of justice discovered an alleged case of bribery and money laundering on november  charges were brought against three former officials of the petrotiger ltda firm who allegedly paid a bribe of approximately us   to a former ecopetrol official to benefit from an oil services contract former ceo joseph sigelman was arrested in the philippines firm attorney gregory weisman pleaded guilty in federal court in camden new jersey and former coceo knut hammarskjold  subjects who could pay up to  years in prison and fines of us   the department has worked closely with and has received significant help from its counterparts in the republic of colombia and offers great recognition for their help in this matter the department of justice said on its websiteecopetrols stock has dropped to   in the last three months the share of the oil company ecopetrol continues without regaining ground after the company published its financing plan for  at the end of last year and production goals for  of  million barrels which according to analysts it is unlikely the uncertainty of how it will finance and an accelerated sale of shares has caused the stock to lose   in the last three months during the last day the title fell  to a price of   a figure lower than that which occurred during the second issue of shares of the company that took place in august  of   the minimum price reported yesterday of   was not registered since august   for experts the uncertainty about how the company will finance its projects for this year which is expected to be through cash bonds and the sale of strategic assets has led to investors have a little nervous according to juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores the report released by citi in which they lowered the target price of the oil companys share in addition to the expectation that ecopetrol will begin to show an increase in reserves it has led to the stock having been down in recent days  for omar escorcia an analyst at asesores en valores there has been a significant drop in the companys stock since it published its financing plan for this year which has a production goal of  barrels and for  of  million barrels which we consider unlikely to happen  his part fabian perdomo stock and securities analyst assures that it is not the time to sell and that the market is overreacting while assimilating that the companys policies point towards a sustained and longterm growth in its productiondespite a drop of more than  in ecopetrols share the analysts recommendation is not to sell it the bad moment that the largest oil company in the country ecopetrol is going through in the stock market has led investors to think about what is the most advisable thing at this time whether to sell buy or on the contrary keep it waiting for the report of reserves that will be given at the end of this month or midfebruary as well as the report of financial results corresponding to the fourth quarter on wednesday the companys share reported a minimum price of   which had not been registered since august   closing at   that is   less than the price set for the last share issue made by the company oil company in  in the last three months this has had a decrease of  lr consulted the different analysts of the sector and the general recommendation is to maintain the action according to experts the target price of the title is on average   and between   and   for december of this year at the close of the previous day the stock continued with a bearish behavior ending at   that is  less than on wednesday according to fabian perdomo stock and securities analyst we have seen a devaluation in the colombian market and a downward trend although there are current reasons that explain the drop in the share price fundamental factors stand out to refrain from selling due to a bearish behavior  for perdomo despite the fact that its latest corporate results do not register surprising growth in its production activities and therefore neither in its financial results the company continues to grow although less accelerated than what the market was used to we believe that the market is overreacting while assimilating that the companys policies are aimed at sustained and longterm growth in its production meanwhile maria adelaida velasquez a specialist analyst in the oil sector at serfinco points out that the low performance of the stock during these weeks has been mainly due to the expectation regarding the report of reserves and the issue of production for  with a goal of  million barrels the production goal of reaching  million barrels next year is difficult to achieve last year the addition of reserves was low so there is expectation in the next report  for analysts the bad moment that the stock is going through has also been due to external factors such as the better results of the us economy the good results in the creation of  new jobs in the private sector in december plus some reports from investment banks recommending their clients to underweight emerging markets meanwhile for cesar cuervo oil sector analyst at credicorp capital the action has been punished due to the uncertainty about the fulfillment of the goals set by the company for this and next year the longterm goals of the oil company which have had the action very punished as well as the production goal that was below expectation for now the recommendation is not to get carried away by nervousness and wait for recovery oil companies lead the week of losses on the stock market the downward behavior that the local market has had in recent days is reflected in the low prices of some of the most important stocks on the stock market in the last day the titles that had a downward behavior were canacol energy that fell  to   pacific rubiales that fell  to   and isagen that ended the session with a decrease of   to   meanwhile the actions that had a positive day were conconcreto which rose  to   and grupo argos which achieved a  rebound to   opinions diego usme ultraburstiles analyst the recommendation at this time for investors is to keep the stock on the fundamental side no surprises or strong changes are expected  cesar cuervo analyst at credicorp capital the stock has been heavily penalized by the production goals published by the company which are mostly longterm the reservation report is expected ecopetrols extraordinary meeting was another piece of news that generated tension after the bad run that ecopetrols action has had yesterday the company called an extraordinary meeting which will be held on january  in which several points will be discussed such as the election of new members of the board after the departure of fabio echeverri who lasted more than  years as a representative of the shareholders although the company did not want to comment on the issue and assured that all the information will be given at the assembly analysts hope that the issues discussed will shed more light on the oil companys plans for this year in the last three months the stock has had a decrease of more than  mainly due to the bad behavior that has occurred during the last three weeks at the close of the trading session yesterday the title ended with a fall of  at a price of   according to maria adelaida velasquez serfincos oil sector analyst the stock will continue to behave downwardly over the next few days awaiting the reserve report in which there is more expectation at the close of the last session the market continued with a bearish behavior among the actions that had a positive session the following stand out avianca preferential which rose  to   there is also cemex which rose  to   and canacol energy which rose  to   among the securities that ended on the decline are cementos argos which fell  to   grupo sura which fell  to   and valorem which fell  to   the indices had a negative behavior the colcap closed at  units with a drop of  the colsc and the colir had a drop of  and  respectivelythe five points that complicate the outlook for ecopetrol in  the countrys main oil company ecopetrol started the year on the wrong foot the company has in sight five situations that complicate the outlook among which the fall in the stock by more than  in the last three months the case of the bribery of a former employee and the discontent among investors for its budget for  to these situations are added two other headaches that ecopetrol has had for some time the modernization of its refineries in cartagena reficar and barrancabermeja and the debate over the payment that the state makes to the company for produce the fuels the latter represents approximately  of what colombians pay for each gallon of gasoline for julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines and energy all these issues may continue to affect the movement of the action in the coming days the theory is reaffirmed by the economist eduardo sarmiento stating i think it is very likely that the stock will continue to decline because the oil and mining situation is having serious difficulties today colombians do not see the company with the same optimism  the closing of the title on friday was in line with this forecast it registered a drop of  and stood at   however the records of the action may be responding to the international behavior of other economies rather than to the direction of the company itself so hernando barrero president of the association of petroleum engineers acipet believes that there is no to expedite a judgment of this situation we trust that ecopetrol will maintain its good results because it is an organized company with solidity in the national market he said there would be a legal problem the situation of the oil company could be complicated after the complaint that it revealed in recent days about the alleged bribery that expetrotiger executives made to a former ecopetrol employee since the affected companies could sue it the agreement between the us company and the former official would have established benefits in an oil services contract that put other entities interested in the agreement at a disadvantage due to this condition the claims could be between us   million and us   million according to experts consulted by lr these payments would not do any good for the organization which has already assumed a budget of us   million for this year especially when financial requirements would lead it to borrow us   billion to meet its projections this latest announcement was reported by ecopetrol to the financial superintendence last month and generated partial discontent in the market as a result the stock went down and reached the lows of  this is why ecopetrols budget is another issue that worries investors however for a company that used to invest no more than us   million a year this is an important figure added vera as for other issues to come in  the oil company has two hot potatoes one will be the formula to define the price of fuel the senate has made a repeated request to reduce what ecopetrol receives for the cost of production and they point to a reduction of   for a gallon of gasoline the government has emphasized that it will not take money away from the joint venture but the real debate will take place in the first half of the year and it will be known where further reductions can be made it would be a mistake to think of selling a gallon subsidized by ecopetrol because that will have a very strong effect on your budget i dont think the government will change its position said former deputy minister of mines manuel maiguashca changes in the board of directors as if that were not enough to the difficulties mentioned are added changes in the board of directors of the company beyond a regular adjustment the sector received with surprise the departure of fabio echeverry who told the media i have no idea what the reasons are that led to this decision echeverry served for nearly  years as the representative of both public and private shareholders on the organizations board of directors it is true that ecopetrol has a consolidated government and has credibility in the market but these decisions are going to affect it added vera luis fernando ramirez current president of the leasing federation gonzalo restrepo former director of grupo exito and engineer horacio ferreira are some of the names that sound to fill the vacancies of echeverry the former president of andi luis carlos villegas and the minister of mines amylkar acosta the three candidates have already submitted to ecopetrol the letters in which they accept the nomination for the position it is expected that these appointments will be made at the next extraordinary shareholders meeting that will take place on january  in corferias bogota until then the company is getting ready to announce momentous decisions for more than  minority shareholders who have placed their investment trust in the most important oil company in the country reserves are still a challenge industry experts say that the key to ecopetrol as a company lies in its exploration and exploitation portfolio in fact for the former vice minister of mines manuel maiguashca  of the companys business is concentrated in these two lines this responds to a key reason the persistent need to increase the countrys reserves since there has not been a large discovery that guarantees the extension of this oil currently reserves average  years ecopetrol increases its production but it still needs to focus more on the exploration of large projects in order to increase its reserves maiguashca said of course the company has been in line with this need and will allocate us   million to these issues in  opinions manuel maiguashca former vice minister of mines the biggest problem of the company is in exploration and production in order to increase reserves there is  of the value of ecopetrols business  hernando barrero president of acipet the bribery is a specific and personal case for which they will continue to carry out investigations and measures so that those involved respond for their actions eduardo sarmiento director of the center for economic studies school of engineers at the beginning of this administration it was said that the country would have never dreamed of income thanks to this sector but the truth is that the goal has not been achieved ecopetrols good name must be shielded in two transcendental scenarios the most important company in colombia and one of the largest in the world in the eyes of fortune magazine things do not start well in  the first has to do with the low price that the market is reaching ecopetrols share price during the first days of transactions in the secondary market and the second the bribery scandals in which it has been involved by improper actions of few highlevel officials of the mixed state these are situations that must be corrected as soon as possible as ecopetrol is a company that cannot be played with or experimented with much less expose it to weakening the mixed state company is not only important for the national coffers by contributing large resources to the budget but also because a good part of the purchases of goods and services in the oil regions comes from its commercial performance there are many municipalities that live off the economy where the colombian multilatina is a symbol and institution but what really matters is that more than half a million natural and legal persons have investments in ecopetrol shares and everything that happens with that company affects their accounts the current national leadership of the energy sector is aware of the issue and is expected to make the appropriate redirection decisions in the short term before being minister of mines amilkar acosta was a member of the board of directors therefore he is prepared to consider the situation the departure of the veteran political and union leader of the board fabio echeverri also becomes a golden opportunity for the senior management of the company headed by javier genaro gutierrez pemberthy to reinforce the cadres with fresher figures who know the sector for all this it is the opportune moment at the beginning of this year to shield the good name of ecopetrol making the necessary moves and above all activating the reputation protocols before the management and brand of the colombian multilatina par excellence begins to be tampered with  ecopetrol must stay away from all political interests this election year there are not only three months marked by the elections to the congress of the republic but the presidential votes next may and the mixed state one represents the central checkbook of the administration this is why the imminent general assembly of partners and shareholders to be held in the first quarter should think more about the role that the company plays for the entire economic country rather than allowing itself to be impregnated with the political whiff of this time the success of the company so far is independence in its actionsprosecutors office investigates bribery of a former ecopetrol official the office of the attorney general of the nation opened a formal investigation into the alleged bribery of the firm petro tigre to a former official of the state oil company ecopetrol this was announced by the head of the anticorruption unit of the prosecutors office mario montes giraldo who indicated that on the instruction of the prosecutor eduardo montealegre it was decided to open the investigation against eight people the investigations are due to the allegations of a possible bribery carried out by some executives of the multinational petrotiger ltda who have already been withdrawn from the company to an ecopetrol official also retired to be favored with a contract in principle the investigation will be aimed at determining the possible responsibility of said people whose identification is not yet known but who would be some officials of ecopetrol the multinational petrotiger ltda and several individuals the interrogations will be resolved according to the results of the methodological work plan for this investigation as well as the respective reports that the judicial police deliver to the prosecutors in the case montes explained that a team was formed that is made up of several prosecutors and a group specialized in administrative corruption from the technical investigation body of the prosecutors office the process is also carried out at the express request of the president of the republic himself who warned that this type of conduct could not be allowed and asked the prosecutors office to establish responsibility for that type of conductanalysts believe that ecopetrols share will remain stable although the ecopetrol share yesterday did not change its price the title continues to worry investors and analysts who closely follow the companys behavior the tension that exists occurs after it had been trading at   in  today it ranges between   and   analysts consulted by lr assure that despite the devaluation that the title has had it is expected to remain constant throughout the year says catalina tobon skandia analyst among the negative factors that have determined the trend of the action are global flows according to katherine ortiz an analyst at corredores asociados latin america is not interesting for international markets thus affecting commodities or nonsubstitute products in addition he adds that another problem is the life indexes of the oil companys reserves due to the fact that great uncertainty is being generated about the final result of the report analysts prefer to maintain discretion regarding the share price forecasts however they accept that it will be constant without rises or falls in addition they are waiting to know if new shares will be issued despite the panic that occurred last week when the stock fell  in the stock market at a price of   a figure lower than the one that occurred during the second issue of shares on the other hand alianza valores analyst juan david ballen affirmed that the corruption scandals by the petrotiger company and the former official of the colombian oil company david orlando duran florez will not affect the stock market indices or the price of shares due to because it was an isolated component of the market even ecopetrol in its most recent statement expressed its support for the government and the prosecutors office to clarify what happened about a bribe of us   for collaboration to obtain an agreement for oil services with ecopetrol or one of its contractors according to the closing data of the colombian stock exchange the companys stock had a quite volatile movement however it ended with a variation in its price for now the expectation is maintained for the financial results of the company and for the oil reserve data that is expected to be given soon the most important thing according to analysts is to remain calm and wait for the company to comment on the doubts brent falls to less than us   for nuclear deal according to reuters information brent oil to be delivered in february was down  cents to us   a barrel at  gmt the contract closed up  cents on friday brent crude expanded its decline after industry sources said the buzzard field in the north sea was returning to full production on monday nexen which operates the field declined to comment when brent fell to less than   a barrel on monday after six world powers signed an agreement to seek a solution to their problems the opinion juan david ballen stock analyst corruption issues in ecopetrols corporate governance will not have a negative effect on the companys securities as this is an isolated componentecopetrol received a disbursement of us   million from eximbank the countrys main oil company ecopetrol reported to the financial superintendency that in december it received a disbursement of more than us   million guaranteed by the export credit agency of the united states of america  us eximbank the transaction corresponded to the fulfillment of the credit agreement longterm credit that the company agreed with the financial entity for a total of us   million the

carlos villegas who due to his new role could not continue on the board of the oil company a place that will be assumed by gonzalo restrepo former president of exito stores undoubtedly the vacancy that has generated the most controversy is the one left by fabio echeverri correa who was president of the board for  years and whose departure would have been influenced by the closeness of the executive with former president alvaro uribe echeverri even questioned that an extraordinary meeting will be called for this taking into account that the assembly of the oil company is held in march

horacio ferreira rueda will arrive at acostas position as representative of the departments replacing echeverri will be luis fernando ramirez and instead of villegas the businessman gonzalo restrepo lopez will join the meeting our great challenge is to be able to increase the life of our reserves during the extraordinary shareholders meeting the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez reaffirmed that the companys challenge is to be able to increase the reserves that today are close to eight years old the executive stressed that the replacement rate for the crude they consume each year has been  but that exploration efforts must still be doubled so that there is a better chance of increasing reserves along these lines the company had already announced in its investment plan for  that the amount for upstream production and exploration us   million share price the fall in the share price which has reached more than  in recent months was one of the main topics of the day according to what gutierrez explained this negative variation corresponds to movements in external markets because there has been a decline in investments in emerging markets but optimism still needs to be maintained the president assured because the action is still profitable for example for those who acquired the title in the first issue november  today they have a gain of  on this date the share was at   and today it is trading on average at  new ecopetrol board to achieve one million barrels the rails are now adjusted so that the ecopetrol locomotive runs with more power the new board of directors of the company will assume from today the task of consolidating the goal of one million barrels per day of oil bpdp and optimizing the reserves that reach about eight years the table will have three new members who were approved with  of the votes in favor the day was held with the partners of the oil company who were summoned yesterday to the extraordinary assembly the strategy is already defined to reach one million barrels in  now they will have to find out how they do it using the tools they have said maria adelaida velasquez an oil analyst at serfinco the task would be  bpdp because ecopetrol already produces around  bpdp luis fernando ramirez who will replace fabio villegas came to preside over the board of directors this former defense minister was nominated after the surprise departure of villegas as representative of the producing departments will be horacio ferreira who will replace the minister of mines amylkar acosta and gonzalo restrepo former president of grupo exito takes over instead of luis carlos villegas who is now colombias ambassador to the united states this team will have to define the most important projects which can increase barrel production likewise the new board will have to take the necessary measures to increase exploration and reserves in the coming years said julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines selection of the board of directors the shareholders of ecopetrol gave their yes to three members proposed by the government according to javier genaro gutierrez president of the oil company the appointment of dr horacio ferreira obeys the articles of law  which mentions that on our board one of the members will be a representative of the producing departments ferreira was proposed by alan jara governor of meta and approved by the other leaders as for the cases of doctors restrepo and ramirez they are independent persons proposed by the government due to their extensive experience added the executive roberto steiner in turn will continue as representative of ecopetrols retail shareholders he came to office in  after being nominated by investors pension funds and layoffs with this outlook ecopetrol will continue to make decisions that will set the course to guarantee growth in the coming years the share continued to decline despite the managerial changes the changes in ecopetrols board of directors did not represent a positive alteration in the movement of the share after the announcement of the new table the stock rose towards noon and reached   however during the afternoon it fell again and closed the day at   this figure represented a variation of  points compared to the last closing for the president of the oil company javier genaro gutierrez this trend also responds to movements in the foreign market because the cash flow in emerging countries decreases as europe shows signs of recovery the opinion julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at minminas there are two great challenges adding more reserves and increasing production and strengthening corporate governance on transparency issues if it is not done the company will stop growing restrepo is the new president of the board of ecopetrol the former president of grupo exito gonzalo restrepo was chosen yesterday as the new president of the board of directors of ecopetrol just one day after the approval of the new administrative team that will define the companys path the changes have already begun in the main oil company in the country at  restrepo will assume the position after the departure of fabio echeverri who left the company unexpectedly in recent days however the appointment of restrepo would also have generated surprise in the sector since luis fernando ramirez was expected to become president because he entered the board in replacement of echeverri until then the businessman had been the president of the table with a clearer position on the board of the mixed oil company restrepo will have the task of leading the organizations strategy to overcome important challenges ahead reaching the daily production of one million barrels in  make the necessary determinations to increase exploration and make it more likely to increase reserves and define how the need for financing of us   billion will be met this last amount is necessary to complete the  budget which amounts to us   million in this way we send a strong message from the executive of respect for the corporate governance that governs ecopetrol it was then approved that dr restrepo as an independent member presides over the board of directors  said the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta the head of the portfolio also gave a boost to the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez to continue in office and so the other members of the board supported hima barrel of brent at us   will facilitate the financing of us   billion from ecopetrol the outlook for brent oil this year could benefit the financing plans of the countrys main oil company ecopetrol the market estimates that a barrel will be between us   and us   with which the company could meet the entire budget projected for  us   million among this total the state oil company calculated at the end of last year that it would still have a financing need of us   billion but this deduction was based on the assumption of an average basket of us   where brent determines more than  of daily exports yet another is market behavior at press time the price of brent was   analysts are thinking that oil can remain stable i think it will remain at that average says felipe campos director of investigations at alianza valores maria adelaida velasquez oil analyst at serfinco assures that they are projecting a barrel at us   citi research was more optimistic about this outlook raising the average for the commodity to   during the final quarter of last year citigroups research division presented this forecast taking into account that the situation in the middle east had not yet stabilized in other words if the us   base that ecopetrol averages is added to the us   that the company will receive for each barrel it exports the future budget of the oil company could vary of the  average barrels per day of oil bpdp that the company produced in the third quarter of  approximately  were exported this means that the state oil company could raise an additional us   million if market forecasts are met with this money in hand the company would not have the need to go to an issue of shares or borrow in the foreign market as has been speculated price prospects not everything is certain on the international scene for campos there are factors that could lead to a more significant drop in crude oil the increasingly stable conflicts in countries like iran and lebanon oil powers predict a downward future for brent last year there was a drop in raw materials a scenario that kept oil up campos explained added to this situation is the future supply of the united states which could stop importing crude by  all these elements will play against or in favor of ecopetrol the shares could be sold in the eeb if the market forecasts do not come to pass in  and brent is trading below us   a barrel ecopetrol is already analyzing other options that it could execute in the course of this year another resource for financing has to do with assets that are not strategic for us such as the shares we have in the bogota energy company eeb explained the president of the oil company javier genaro gutierrez but this decision is still under study so the company has not set dates or prices to execute the transaction added to this is that the entity is getting ready to increase its production in  as a baseline it has established  bpdp but the total could rise even more thanks to the commercialities it declared in  opinions javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol  another resource has to do with assets that are not strategic for us such as the shares we have in the bogota energy company  felipe campos research director at alianza valores last year the price of oil remained high due to a mixture of factors conflicts in iran a country with oil potential and social problems in libyacountdown for the ecopetrol board to define the future of campo rubiales next friday january  will be a determining date for the board of directors of ecopetrol to define the course of the rubiales field on that day the colombian oil company will review with pacific rubiales the progress of the star pilot project the results will serve as an input for the company to define if it renews the association contract and that the canadian can continue operating the largest oil production area in the country  the two partners made the decision to review the progress of the project on that date january  the date remains federico restrepo vice president of corporate affairs at pacific rubiales told this newspaper the decision on the association contract which expires on may   will be fundamental for the plans of the colombian company which seeks to reach one million barrels of crude in  the rubiales field located in the meta extracts  barrels of oil per day on average bpdp which makes it the main producer in the entire country they are followed by castilla and quifa respectively ecopetrols decision on the field will be influenced by several factors one of which will be pacifics ability to double current production thanks to star technology initially the pilot tests are applied in quifa but the canadian plans to take them to campo rubiales because the program is expected to allow extraction capacity to double based on the experience in quifa the national oil company will analyze if pacific can apply the same program in rubiales to increase crude production putting the magnifying glass on the documents that pacific will deliver will be in the hands of the board composed of mauricio cardenas minister of finance amylkar acosta minister of mines and tatyana orozco director of the national planning department dnp the independent members roberto steiner representative of the minority shareholders jorge pinzon and joaquin moreno and the new executives of the table are added gonzalo restrepo chairman of the board horacio ferreira representative of the producing departments and luis fernando ramirez the replacement for fabio echeverry who was on the board according to experts in the sector ecopetrol has in sight three paths to define rubiales course the first contemplates that it remains with the field and all its production that decision would put it very close to a million bpdp as the oil company already extracts around  bpdp german corredor director of the national university energy observatory assures that ecopetrol should keep the field and have all the production instead of sharing it however this will be a decision that will involve a significant increase in its investment plan because the extraction of heavy crude requires specialized technology which is generally developed by other companies said julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines and energy the company must also think about optimizing its infrastructure as well as its human talent who must be prepared in this area i have not seen plans in which ecopetrol is operating these projects added vera the second path for the colombian company is to enter into a new contract based on star technology with the canadian company starting in may  restrepo pointed out that it is an excellent option for the countrys interests which ecopetrol will surely evaluate accordingly the best way if these terms are maintained the state oil company would continue to receive  of the crude extraction while pacific would keep the rest we all know that pacific rubiales investment is key and it will be a competition that ecopetrol will have to review said javier betancourt president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh the third course that the colombian company can take is to stay with the field and obtain the technology through the provision of services because pacific has already developed a method to increase recovery and ecopetrol does not have it explained corredor under these terms the companies must agree on the periods in which the equipment will be supplied and their conditions because the canadian company has already obtained a patent for the star technology all these aspects make this fridays meeting key for ecopetrol to determine the course of the main oil field in colombia ecopetrol is awaiting the pacific rubiales report before the financial superintendence ecopetrol sent a statement yesterday in which it provided clarity on various issues regarding the process with pacific rubiales among these he stressed that the pilot program is in the experimental phase for this reason until the evaluation is concluded and it can be ascertained whether the technology is suitable and successful in the technical environmental and economic terms ecopetrol cannot make definitive pronouncements about the success or failure of said technology opinions julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at minminas ecopetrol must analyze whether it has the human and technical capacity to develop the necessary technology for this type of heavy crude javier betancourt president of the national hydrocarbons agency the companies are in an evaluation program we have to wait for the results to be produced for pacific and ecopetrol to make decisions  german corredor director of the unal energy observatory the company will have to assess the budget issue because it will have to invest in specialized technologybiofuels will grow in  due to the new ecopetrol plant colombia could increase the mixture of fuel alcohol with fossil gasoline from  to  in  to the extent that ecopetrol puts into operation its new ethanol plant in the eastern plains revealed the national federation of biofuels this is the bioenergy plant near puerto lopez meta which would be capable of

biofuels of colombia fedebiocombustibles whose anniversary is on february council of state ratifies award in favor of oil company ecopetrol against pacific rubiales according to a ruling of the state council the annulment appeal filed by meta petroleum a subsidiary of pacific rubiales is declared unfounded likewise the company is ordered to pay in favor of ecopetrol  legal monthly minimum wages in force for the costs of the process in march of last year the bogota arbitration tribunal confirmed that ecopetrols position was valid on price differences the difference lay in the equation while ecopetrol said that the payment for this oil should be assessed on the entire production of the quifa field pacific expected that it would be made over  which is the participation that the company has on that facility in addition to this concept the claim that the colombian oil company had that close to us   million be canceled was declared by the court as something outside its jurisdiction as

most valuable brands in the world last year for example ecopetrol ranked number seven in the top latin american companies considering it a brand with a brand value of us   million  more than that

brand finance global defines a brand as the firm and associated intellectual property including the word mark and its iconography as if it were a mathematical formula the company determines the value of a company for which it would be willing to pay for the license of its brand this approach involves estimating future revenue attributable to a brand and calculating a royalty rate that you can charge for use the different companies or consulting firms that make these rankings have different methods to perform this calculation hence the results between one index and another are different

trillion  less than the previous year and in ebitda which had a variation of  and closed at   trillions the total sales of the oil company stepped on positive ground reaching   billion but they disappointed the market which expected them to be in the order of   billion taking into account the evolution of the market according to a survey by lr analysts consulted agree that the outlook is positive considering the great environmental challenges and adjustments in the capital markets and shows that shareholders can be confident that there will be growth even if it is lower how are dividends left yesterday the firms board of directors approved a profit distribution proposal that will remain at  of the net value as ordinary dividend plus  of the extraordinary which means that the total dividend would be   per action news that the thousands of citizens who are partners of the oil company did not expect and who calculated that the positive results would mean greater value to them according to juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores if the company distributed  of the profit the dividend would be   a lower figure compared to last year but still very attractive equivalent to a yield of  annually  javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol assured that the firms strategic plan has generated very important achievements during these years such as a  growth in production a  increase in the volume of reserves the spokesperson attributed these achievements to the implementation of a new transportation model as well as an increased supply of fuels he also

quarter of  increased  compared to  operating expenses for the same period were  juan camilo santana professor at the jorge tadeo lozano university explained that ecopetrol is making a very large investment in exploration because colombia has not increased its production however he says it is a risk that investors could charge him negative in the short term and the fact is that the average production of  was  kboed with a growth of  compared to the previous year despite transport restrictions and blockades in some communities santana anticipates that at least tomorrows session will reflect the impact of that decision the reports reported to the superfinanciera coincide with the survey carried out by lr among the main commission agents in the country that expected profits of   billion enkas operating income fell the firms net operating income for the end of  was   million and had a decrease of  compared to the previous year the company explained that the results are mainly due to lower sales volume lower prices of raw materials and changes in the mix of products and destinations all explained by the low global demand and the supply of asian products at low prices according to a statement from the polymer producer the opinions juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores if the company distributed  of the profit the dividend would be   a lower figure compared to last year but still very attractive for investors angela buitrago analyst of afin sa what marked the direction of the results of the last quarter was the announcement of the commerciality of the  block in acacias meta a very positive extractionecopetrol figures drove losses on the stock market the indices of the colombian stock exchange presented losses for another day and continues in this way immersed in a negative trend this time driven by the results presented by ecopetrol which did not convince the market thus according to the closing data the reference indicator by capitalization in the bvc colcap closed the day with a decrease of  reaching  points similarly the colsc closed the day with a fall of  that took it to  units but these werent the only ones with red numbers the colir closed the session with a  cut to  integers while the coleqty which ended the day falling  to  units the factor that led the dynamics of yesterday was the behavior of the ecopetrol share the market did not take the results corresponding to  in the best way and with that there was a significant sale of the asset which was also transferred to the rest of the oil companies that are listed on the local market  says juan david ballen equity analyst of alianza valores and of course this trend was reflected in the movement of market shares among those that fell the most for the day enka led the ranking with a loss of  to reach   followed by ecopetrol titles that fell  to close the day at   per share pacific rubiales also had a decline of  to a price of   meanwhile on the positive side of the table the good performance of cemex latam holdings stood out which had a rise of  to   similarly banco de occidente presented an increase of  to   per share and mineros rose  and closed the day with a price of   however in the coming days the downward trend is expected to continue in the colombian stock exchange which could reach a trading level of  pointsfinancial results another reason for ecopetrol to complete a year down immersed in the time when companies present their results for  the biggest hit in the stock market was suffered by the securities of ecopetrol a company whose figures did not convince what has been seen so far is that business results have been positive as there have been growth in revenues and operational progress in general of course the noise dragged by emerging markets means that no major movements have been seen except in the case of ecopetrol says alejandra mendez an analyst at serfinco on wednesday the first day of trading after presenting the results the company fell  to close the day at   while yesterday its titles gained  to   the results were not good in production it did not have a significant increase in reserves the market did not like that the increase was in existing blocks and not due to new deposits and furthermore it can be considered that the increase was actually  and that indicator is the most important for an oil company in addition the sales basket was reduced by an average of us   per barrel this is coupled with the fact that they continue to bet on a high dividend which is why it distributes a lot of profit and needs to get into debt  says diego franco an analyst at asesoria e inversiones but not all the figures are negative as franco adds the company made a large investment in the cartagena refinery furthermore the yield or return on profit reaches  above average historical evil of the stock although the most recent blow was caused by the results of  the truth is that ecopetrols securities accumulate a negative year in which the shares have fallen  going from    months ago to   which seems to confirm the markets idea that the stock has always been overvalued it was always seen that the share price was above its real value and also a lot of liquidity has come out of the market which has directly impacted the share says franco but thats not the only reason for the declines as stated by omar escorcia equity analyst at asesores en valores the issue that weighed the most in the stock is the uncertainty with the reserves since only with that data the stock lost more than   in a few days and along with that throughout  there were several problems that hit the titles in this sense the exdividend date caused a significant decline as did rumors about changes in the presidential leadership and problems with communities and attacks among others all these aspects make the force with which ecopetrol began its path in the stock market today it is an aspect of the past there is no doubt that ecopetrol is the largest company on the stock market but also due to its conditions it is one of the hardest hit in the end the great losers of these movements are the shareholders of the company those who acquired the securities in  at   will have been able to benefit but those who bought on a bonanza will have seen their investment greatly reduced opinions omar escorcia equity analyst at asesores en valores the only company that has the necessary fundamentals to explain a drop in its share is ecopetrol although there has also been a not so positive reception in grupo exito juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores although profits decreased in  the expectation for  is different we are projecting an advance between  and  in colcap that will make the shares appreciateecopetrol the only colombian among the most admired the colombian state oil company ecopetrol is the only location that appears in the latest ranking published by fortune magazine

for being emblematic and having products with style and easy to use like the iphone the publication argues that the importance of the technology firm is also based on the growing income it has had in

company rubbing shoulders with giants like cocacola starbuks walt disney fedex nike bmw procter  gamble pg and ibm can also be read as an indicator that the national economy is on the right track jose esteban rojas proano director of research and development of the virtual business center cvn says that the presence of the colombian in this ranking is a quite interesting factor which reflects a good work on the part of businessmen and the government  the specialist adds that this refers to the fact that the colombian economic phenomenon is from recent years and companies need a little longer periods of time to consolidate in international markets spain agrees that in a world team it is not strange that only one colombian company is found there are too many large companies in such a way that it is an honor and a privilege and speaks highly of the country that there is at least one in this ranking opinions rafael espana gonzalez director of economic studies at fenalco it is an honor and a privilege it speaks very well of the country that there is at least one company in this ranking  jose esteban rojas proano director of research and development of the cvn i think that in one

money is safe by the endorsement of the title and second by the dividends that the companies offer taking into account the above and also the current situation where most of the companies in the country have announced and confirmed their profit distribution projects it is important to know what can be done with the money obtained to get the most out of it the first option recommended by experts is to reinvest the dividend that is obtained and under this dynamic there are many options in the market to be able to expand the portfolio the expense of the dividend will depend on the plans that the person has if that money has been allocated for a longterm project it is best to buy new titles in the same company or in others that have good returns explained felipe campos chief of economic investigations of alianza valores campos added that the plans also depend on the age of the people and that is why he believes that the number of actions that should be taken would have to be the result of the subtraction of  and the age of the individual according to this simple operation the age of the person turns out to be fundamental to know how much i should invest or not the older the investment should be lower in order to take advantage of the dividends in consumption says the specialist options with banking broadening the horizon and looking for new products for the portfolio can be a very good alternative in banking there are different quite attractive options to invest the money resulting from profits allowing you to have available liquidity and obtain a return the first option could be the fiducuenta de bancolombia an investment alternative that seeks to offer a higher profitability than traditional savings products along with stable income in the short term the minimum opening amount is   and the minimum of additions and withdrawals is   another alternative can be found in daviviendas fixed rate cds which will recognize your investment and returns at a fixed interest rate according to the term and the agreed amount for diego otero rector of the uniciencia university in bucaramanga the important thing when receiving dividends is to put them to produce and take into account the conditions in which they are going to invest the advantage of the aforementioned products and in general of those offered by banks is that they are low risk and therefore their profitability is not greater in general when you dont want to take risks you can buy cdts or other similar products which are generally shortterm and backed by serious institutions said credicorp capitals chief equity analyst cesar cuervo the trust companies and stock brokerage firms have collective investment funds in which in addition to receiving a higher return they can also diversify their portfolio and evaluate alternatives in other types of products it is important to mention that not all portfolios are in installments and that the open ones allow you to withdraw your money whenever you want without having to pay some type of penalty cuervo believes that it is truly attractive for individuals to invest in these group funds since the benefits of diversification are many however he clarifies that it is important to bear in mind that the risks will be greater and as you win you can also lose the money given for experts the choice to reinvest dividends also has a series of disadvantages such as that it must be done regularly if the objective is to have longterm profits most of the companies that pay dividends do so annually and for lastly there is the risk that the money could be lost in the event of a hypothetical bankruptcy of the company do not invest in companies without support the government the financial superintendence and the superintendency of companies have alerted the public to the appearance of illegal money captors in accordance with the recommendations that the entities make the ideal is to ignore any company that is not registered and is not monitored by the competent authorities on many occasions due to the desire to earn a lot of money the money is given to unscrupulous people who all they want is to scam people in that sense the superfinancial makes a call to the public not to fall into businesses that promise high returns or exorbitant income since they run the risk of being involved in an illegal activity and participating in pyramid schemes as they were presented in the past opinions felipe campos head of research at alianza valores the spending of the dividend will depend on the plans the person has if that money has been earmarked for a longterm project it is best to buy new titles cesar cuervo head of credicorp capital shares in general when you dont want to take risks you can buy cdts or other similar products

cano limon field located in the department of arauca in the northeast of the country near the border with venezuela initially the union sindical obrera uso which groups together workers in the oil industry said that occidental canceled the contracts of  employees in the cano limon field which produced an average of  barrels per day in  there are  workers who were left without a contract the company pressured them to terminate the contract by mutual agreement oscar garcia head of the uso in arauca told reuters but occidentals source in colombia who asked to keep his name withheld explained that the company suspended the activities of some contractors after it was forced to declare force majeure on production it is not a massive dismissal it is a declaration of force majeure on orders and contracts for production services said the source of the us oil company we have not been able to pump the storage capacity of the field production was filled and due to the impossibility of pumping due to the attacks against the pipeline it was necessary to declare force majeure he added occidentals source did not specify the number of suspended contractors but assured that once the operation in the field is resumed they will return to their activities an increase in guerrilla attacks against colombias oil industry led to a reduction in production and exploration activities in

federal reserve fed despite the fact that it is already being dismantled generated the recovery and stabilization of developed markets and a great liquidity of dollars in the world the foregoing is important because it shows that there is a lot of money in the market that according to credicorp capital during the event elections and economic situation where to invest  will return to emerging markets in the short term hence the shares of the financial sector specifically grupo aval and davivienda are the most attractive for their returns for investors in addition to the financial sector those of hydrocarbons such as grupo argos and ecopetrol y alimentos nutresa are also recommended by the commission agent for this year a recovery in profits is expected in the second and fourth quarters with an expected annual growth of  however the recovery will not be homogeneous and banks will report the highest growth between  and  grupo avals securities have an attractive price level the share is trading below its historical average in addition to this the share issue was successfully concluded and there is no risk of a new issue in the short term its yield indicator that represents the percentage of return compared to the share price will be  for this year on the other hand davivienda expects a good year due to the normalization of the treasury income and the absence of extraordinary expenses analysts also estimate that the cost of credit risk has decreased its yield will be  our high conviction bet on the banking sector comes because we expect it to post the highest organic earnings growth over the next five years explained daniel velandia director of economic research at credicorp capital hydrocarbons sector for the commission agent this sector presents uncertainty due to what its operating results will be however the pacific rubiales share is recommended due to the solidity of its reserves growth in production portfolio of diversified exploration assets among other things the yield will be  ecopetrol despite not showing the best scenario due to moderate expectations for operational growth continues to be one of the preferred ones due to what it represents in the colombian stock market finally the grupo argos portfolio is concentrated in sectors related to infrastructure which have positive growth prospects the shares belonging to the consumer sector should grow at the rate of nominal gross domestic product and this according to velandia would be positive this year this is why the nutresa title is also among the favorites

yesterday that ecopetrol and chevron are structuring a project to build a dual plant in ballenas riohacha in other words the oil companies will be able to set up an infrastructure to import and export the fuel the announcement was made within the framework of version  of the naturgas congress which began yesterday in cartagena with the presence of the minister and will end tomorrow this can serve in the eventuality that it is necessary acosta clarified this means that the work would give the sector reliability in the event that an el nino phenomenon requires that all thermal generation plants operate at their maximum this could double the current demand for gas and put production  gigs of thermal units gbtu in a tight spot this infrastructure would be added to the regasification plant that sociedad portuaria el cayao will build in the caribbean the work was awarded last february to the consortium led by promigas we are putting our foot on the accelerator on the issue of regasification because we know that it is a solution to the demand that the country requires added the head of the portfolio a new ultimatum acosta once again gave drummond and cerrejon an ultimatum to reach an agreement and define how the methane gas associated with coal will be explored in the mine located in the rancheria river valley that is a gas that must be removed from there and if the companies do not reach an agreement the ministry has already said that it would intervene with a resolution or a decree added naturgas president eduardo pizano both naturgas and the ministry have highlighted the probabilities of the deposit where there may be between  and  tera cubic feet of the resource in other words if the reserves are verified under the ground the country could double the supply time which today is  years according to the association in other words there will be a gas supply for more than  yearsecopetrol and pacific will review the results of the star project this month this month

report to the ecopetrol board we are awaiting a meeting that is being set at the latest in the next few days where we will listen to pacific technicians and managers who will present the progress of the pilot said acosta the results will also be analyzed by international experts with experience in the application of the technology ecopetrol is also expected to announce its decision on the future of quifa the field in which pacifc carried out the tests in the first half of the year the result will also be key for rubiales as the canadian will operate the complex until  the possibility of the contract being renewed will depend on the canadian demonstrating that it can increase the production capacity of the area through recovery initially acosta had said that the meeting would be tomorrow april  but the oil companies did not commit on the one hand the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez said that they will soon determine a date and that whether the technology is approved or not they will announce it for his part the president of pacifc jose francisco arata said that they are awaiting the decision of the colombian progress in reficar ecopetrol executives met last friday

a growth of  said the manager then in fuel transportation promigas emerged with  and transportadora de gas natural tgi with  of the market as the main players the first will expand its infrastructure this year by no less than  kilometers with the gasoducto del sur which will impact that area of the caribbean region where it is the most important gas transporter in  it sold   billion in gas through its  kilometers of gas pipelines and tgi which a few weeks ago once again had the bogota energy company eeb as the majority shareholder and owner of  of its shares added   million for the same concept its president ricardo roa barragan assures that the amount of consumption per user remains however very low compared to the continents neighbors such as bolivia argentina chile and brazil this restricts expansionary projects there is uncertainty regarding the availability of gas and additional reserves which puts us to explore import projects such as liquefied gas for the north coast said roa and finally in distribution and marketing gas natural fenosa and gases de occidente ended last december as the companies in this link that reached the most inhabitants the first to more than  million in bogota cundinamarca and cesar and the second to  in valle del cauca and in the north of the department of cauca arturo gutierrez de pineres president of gases de occidente assured that for this year they aspire to connect  more residential units and that they depend on the energy and gas regulatory commission creg to reach another  townships in an interview with lr gutierrez also revealed that his main objective is that by  at the latest they have covered  of the needs of the almost  towns in valle del cauca including its  municipalities industry the future gas entrepreneurs agree that the hopes that local demand will increase are set in the future that more industries will switch to gas to carry out their production processes those more than  industrialists consume more than  of the volume of units it is a lot most of the industry uses gas it is the best alternative but it is clear that the goal is to increase the market  said antonio celia president of promigas colombia with a privileged position ivan sandrea ernst  young ey global consulting partner in the oil  gas sector assures that the colombian gas market has reached a sufficient level of maturity to expand that is why it is not strange that there are colombian companies in brazil peru and venezuela a virgin market for this industry is mexico we see in certain areas how countries that should actively participate such as ecuador peru and bolivia do not have an industry like colombia argentina is further away venezuela has its complexities and brazil has its own opportunities colombia is better positioned in shoreline and services that includes pipelines he said opinions rene perea anchique commercial director of gas fenosa in colombia there is an important opportunity for cogeneration industrial clients are looking for their processes to be more efficient and thus their raw material to be more competitive  ricardo roa barragan president of tgi potential reserves have been identified in the magdalena medio they will have to be given priority in the next five years to guarantee supply in the medium and long term ecopetrol will be able to maintain issuance and placement projects for up to us   million as part of the procedures required to keep the debt alternatives in force to finance its longterm investment plan the oil company obtained authorization from the ministry of finance and public credit until  this type of news is very positive and in general they are taken as a good sign both for the company and for the country said juan camilo rojas international analyst at credicorp capital he added that the fact that credit quotas are approved to obtain investment resources is something that international markets see with very good eyes the statement clarifies that this authorization in itself does not constitute an issuance of securities or a financing operation therefore ecopetrol must carry out in due course all the necessary approval procedures before the ministry of finance and public credit as well as its board of directors for any debt operation under this authorization according to company information for  the investment plan includes the execution of us   million that is an additional us   million in relation to the  budget juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores said in his investment plan ecopetrol had already planned to go out to raise resources through this mechanism with the announcement to a certain extent what they want to make known is that the process is in process and this could occur in the medium term the production business is the one that will require the most resources about us   million followed by the refining and petrochemical area in which us   million would be spent ballen added that the behavior of fixed income in dollars has remained very stable and the ideal is to take advantage of periods of low volatility also taking into account the appreciation that has occurred in this segment it could be an ideal time to go out and attract resources ecopetrol shares accumulate heavy losses in the last few days in the last three days the decline in the title has lost approximately  although the largest drop is registered at this time since the companys title registered a price of   towards midmorning according to the colombian stock exchange according to juan david ballen an analyst at alianza valores the exdividend period of the share begins today that is those shareholders that appear in the record book as of yesterday are the ones who are going to receive the dividend paid on the  those who buy today do not receive that money so the market is taking the payment that will be made for granted on the other hand the analyst reported that the stock has been falling for a few days because citibank issued a report last week in which supposedly the results that will be delivered april  were going to be negativethe ecopetrol share presented a drop of  on the day yesterday the exdividend period of ecopetrol began a fact that meant a drop in the value of the share of  to close at   the highest drop that was presented in the colombian stock exchange bvc during the session the exdividend period means that investors who buy the oil companys share from yesterday until april  which is when the dividend is paid will not receive that payment while those who sell the stock in this period in addition to receiving the money for the sale will also be beneficiaries of the   per share that the company will pay as stipulated in the assembly according to juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores the beginning of the exdividend period has not been the only thing that has generated a negative effect on the share price a week ago citibank issued a report in which it said that the results that the oil company will deliver on april  would not be the expected this has caused the title to fall by more than  during the last three days  fabricato and carton de colombia also joined ecopetrol among the biggest drops with  and  respectively on the other hand the share that rose the most was canacol energy  to   followed by celsia  to   and avianca holding with an advance of  to   during the session the bvcs benchmark index the colcap fell  and stood at  units the colsc index was in positive territory with an increase of  to  units while the colir fell  to  points last tuesdayecopetrol and pacific have not yet made a decision on the star project ecopetrol and pacific rubiales have not yet defined the future of the star technology that the canadian oil company is applying in the quifa field in the eastern plains the companies met yesterday to analyze the results but did not make a decision despite the fact that the project will be key for the renewal of pacifics contract in the rubiales field the technical report for canadians to explain the project will be presented in less than  days according to what was agreed at the meeting there the project managers will present the advances in technology with which a greater oil production is expected the results will be analyzed by some international experts who will help clarify the panorama the star project represents one of the actions that pacific has taken to extend its partnership contract which expires in june  taking into account that these fields are strategic for the companies the controversy continues after a few days ago an official from the comptrollers office said that the technology did not give the results expected by the mixed oil company however pacific also stepped in to defend its operations at the quifa field for further pilot testingecopetrol share fell  in the session for edgar romero equity analyst at corredores asociados the price of the ecopetrol security in the last seven days six have been negative and the behavior of the share is linked to not very positive expectations of results that will be known tomorrow for its part the capitalization index colcap rose  closing at  units so far this year the stock market indicator has registered a positive variation of  the stock that presented the highest appreciation was fabricato which rose  and its closing price was   among other securities with a positive variation was cementos argos with  to   the share price of construcciones el condor was the one that fell the most presenting a negative variation of  to   cemex was also among those that presented decreases closing at   with a variation of  as for the colsc liquidity index it rose  to  units and the colir rose  to  units during the day   million were negotiated through  operationsfall in oil price and production would not leave good results for ecopetrol the lack of findings by the state company the sabotage suffered by the infrastructure and the drop in the price of crude oil at the international level are the factors that analysts expect to influence the ecopetrol report the expectations of the commission agents assume that the companys profits will be in a range of between   billion and   billion that is an average of   billion an important figure but that would be lower than that the oil company reported in the same month of  when it was   billion the problems in the cano limon  covenas oil pipeline due to an attack perpetuated by the farc guerrillas more than a month ago have not been able to be solved because the indigenous people of the uwa community maintained the order not to allow the reparation by not reaching an agreement at the negotiating table with the government according to information from the indigenous community the foregoing has generated cost overruns in the transportation of crude since as the oil cannot be sent through the pipeline it must be shipped in trucks which increases the operation between  and  for omar escorcia asesores en valores analyst these problems added to other factors would have an impact on production which would be  barrels per day lower than the  reported the previous year reinforcing the thesis that the production target in the in  one million barrels are unlikely to be fulfilled  on the other hand another factor that is affecting the company is the decline in the value of crude oil internationally according to juan david ballen an analyst at alianza valores the price of a barrel of brent which is the one that has the companys benchmark has fallen  compared to  however not everything has been bad at the beginning of  for ecopetrol the revaluation of the peso has been beneficial for the company in the first months of the year there was an upward trend in the price of the dollar but this changed in midmarch as a consequence of the increase in colombias participation in the jp morgan government bond indexemerging markets gbiem  according to ballen it is estimated that the revaluation that the peso has had in one year reaches a level close to  the companys revenue is expected to average   billion higher than last year when they reported   billion although very far from what was received in    billion behavior of the stock the oil companys shares have had a downward behavior for a couple of weeks as a result of the exdividend period and news such as what is happening with the star project between ecopetrol and pacific rubiales in the quifallanos field orientals it is estimated that more than  minority shareholders received   billion corresponding to the payment of the dividend approved by the general assembly of shareholders therefore the market has taken for granted the value of the dividend in the stock showing the worst drop on monday when the payment was made as for the star project the market did not approve that the decision had been postponed in this way we will have to wait for the official results and depending on what happens the stock could continue to fall company share ended in positive territory during tuesdays session on the colombian stock exchange bvc ecopetrols share exceeded a string of negative results and finally ended the day in positive territory although it was not the title with the highest appreciation the rise was  to close at   on monday the stock of the oil company was one of the ones with the greatest decline and registered a fall of  and ended at   so far this year the performance of the title has been negative since it started at   which shows that the loss has been around   opinions omar escorcia analista de asesores en valores the production of barrels will be lower than expected reinforcing the thesis that the production goal for  of one million barrels is unlikely to be met juan david ballen stock analyst at alianza valores the decrease in the price of crude oil at an international level would cause the companys results to be affected the price of brent has fallen  compared to  ecopetrols net profit amounted to   billion in the first quarter the consolidated revenue of the company was   billion the operating profit was   billion and the ebitda was   billion the latter was highlighted by the president of the company javier gutierrez the financial results of the first quarter of  were better than those of the fourth quarter of  the ebitda grew  he said however for the president the results of the first quarter of  reflected difficult conditions for the sector we faced  attacks on the infrastructure and repeated blockades by communities in different parts of the country gutierrez added that to date they report delays in the execution of some projects of exploration and production due to these causes on the transportation front the operation of the bicentenario pipeline has been interrupted since february  and that of the cano limoncovenas pipeline since march  as a consequence of the above the average production was  kbped decreasing  compared to the first quarter of  and  compared to the last quarter of  the president of the company also expressed or that the sale prices in dollars of crude oil products and gas decreased   and  respectively compared to the first quarter of  as a result of market conditions for juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores during the day a lot of volatility will be appreciated in the asset and possibly it will fall but what must be taken into account is that the title takes many sessions discounting the problems that the company has if today the stock falls to the   level i would say that it is attractive to buy because i consider that the market has already incorporated the news and the results were not so bad he addedecopetrols title rises  in the stock market after knowing results although the balance was not the best because when comparing the figures with the same period of  the results are not the best the oil company presented favorable data compared to the fourth quarter of  according to analysts the results were in line with what was expected and apparently the market has been discounting in recent sessions the problems that the company presents especially with the cano limoncovenas pipeline on the other hand the colcap the benchmark index showed a decrease of  and stood at  units at the opening the stock that rises the most is valorem  to   and the one that falls the most is grupo suras preferential  to  the rise in ecopetrols share does not hide the concern about figures for the first half however this fact does not hide the fear of analysts for what could be a worse report in the second quarter the stock ended the day after high volatility up for the second time in a row the rise was  to close at   and it was the most traded share with   million traded for its part the colcap index ended in positive territory climbing  to  units notwithstanding this the volatility of the company and others such as pacific rubiales and bancolombia have caused the balance of the month to be negative for the main indicator of the stock market which in april accumulated a decline of  the utility of the state oil company fell  compared to the first quarter of  that is to say that the company obtained a profit of   billion between january and march  and although it falls compared to the same period of the previous year increased  compared to the fourth quarter of last year ebitda reached   trillion with a growth of  compared to the end of  for diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles the decline in the stateowned companys profits was caused by a contraction in production among others things which was  barrels per day compared to the  barrels that were expected which represents a decrease of  the above is explained by the following events  attacks on the infrastructure interruption of the bicentennial pipeline since february  interruption since march  in cano limoncovenas and delay in the development of facilities in fields such as rubiales expressed the analyst the problems in the cano limon  covenas pipeline due to an attack that the farc guerrillas perpetuated more than a month ago are one of the biggest inconveniences that the company has had and that would condition it for the second quarter the uwa indigenous community has not allowed the settlement of the inconveniences generating cost overruns in transportation of between  and  as it has to be transported by truck the fact of having to transport the crude in trucks is not the only problem because of the attacks the rate of production has decreased damming the crude that is ready to be sold said cesar cuervo head of equity currency at credicorp capital another factor that is affecting the company is the decrease in the value of crude oil internationally according to the companys report the barrel price of brent which is the reference price has fallen  compared to the first quarter of  maya has also had a  drop for the second quarter the increase in crude oil production that countries such as the united states canada and iran have had could generate further falls in the price of oil affecting ecopetrols balance sheets said cuervo despite the aforementioned factors the company reported a  increase in total sales which reached   billion in the first quarter the outlook for ecopetrol over the next few months is not the best unless it manages to solve its infrastructure problems and has a strategy to combat possible low prices in the price of crude the exchange rate benefited the advance in income not everything was bad at the beginning of  for ecopetrol the revaluation of the peso has been beneficial for the company in the first months of the year there was an upward trend in the price of the dollar but this changed in midmarch as a result of the increase in colombias participation in the jp morgan index inventories were also deaccumulated which managed to boost the flow of hydrocarbons sold although these would have to be accumulated again in the following quarter opinions cesar cuervo head of equity at credicorp capital due to the attacks the rate of production has slowed damming the crude that is ready to be sold diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles the decline in profits was caused by a contraction in crude oil production due to attacks among other thingslowering ecopetrols dividends would improve cash flow and debt these two aspects although they did not represent exaggerated changes in the indicators may cause inconveniences in the future and therefore when consulting with experts and analysts they expressed that a measure could be to reduce the delivery of dividends of the company the dividends authorized by the board of directors to distribute total   billion for  as a result of the profits obtained in  which amounted to   billion that is the company delivers approximately  of what it earns according to the companys report the balance sheet of consolidated liabilities shows that as of march   these were located at   billion that is they increased  from the   billion of the december  of last year for camilo silva analyst at valora inversiones the indebtedness that the company presents is mainly due to the amount of money it spends distributing dividends the increase in debt during the first three months of the year is due to the distribution of  of profits and although most of it goes to the government and it needs it one could think of some alternative to reduce the amount and take advantage of the money for other issues  likewise julian villamizar professor at the universidad externado de colombia considers that a lower distribution of dividends and increase the retention rate of profits to  would be good for ecopetrols longterm stability in order to have greater exploration however villamizar also points out that the probability of this happening depends on the governments spending needs so for now it is not feasible for this to happen the company explained for its part that the increase in its liabilities was due to different factors such as distribution of dividends higher taxes contributions and rates and increase in financial obligations at the end of the first quarter liabilities represented  of assets reflecting an increase of   billion on the other hand if the companys cash flow is analyzed a decrease can be observed in the first quarter of  compared to the previous year the final cash position was   trillion   trillion less than in  when the company had   trillion available despite these figures javier gutierrez president of the company assured during the conference to comment on the results that in terms of the projections they had the flow increased since it went from the   billion that had been budgeted to     billion according to analysts the decrease in cash flow creates problems for the company in developing its exploration and expansion plans the ideal when a company presents such ambitious exploration projects such as ecopetrols is to have good liquidity to carry them out currently the useful life of the reserves is nine years so it is necessary to find new deposits  silva explained therefore and as part of the procedures required to keep the debt alternatives in force to finance its longterm investment plan the oil company obtained from the ministry of finance and public credit authorization to issue and place bonds in the markets international for an approximate sum of us   billion until  although the announcement does not constitute an issuance as such or a financing operation it would serve to develop the investment plan in  which includes the execution of us   million an additional   million compared to the  budget this type of news is very positive and in general it is taken as a good sign both for the company and for the country said juan camilo rojas international analyst at credicorp capital the expert added that the fact that credit quotas are approved to obtain investment resources is something that international markets see with very good eyes and can have a positive impact it is important to mention that in any case the company remains solid and with the governments backing in addition it must be taken into account that the passive increase and cash flow are negative for the company profit fell due to  attacks the first quarter of the year was not the best public order problems and the drop in the price of crude oil affected the balance sheets of the oil company profit fell  compared to the first quarter of  that is the oil company obtained a profit of   trillion between january and march  problems in the cano limoncovenas pipeline were the ones that caused the greatest impact although on thursday night the ministry of the interior reached an agreement with the uwa indigenous community to be able to continue with the repairs and in this way to be able to transport the oil again in an agile and less expensive way it is estimated that costs rose  because of the attack opinions javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol with the projections we had we expected to close the first quarter with a flow of   billion each but it ended up being   billion julian villamizar professor at the externado de colombia university it would be good for ecopetrols longterm stability to have a lower dividend distribution and to increase the profit retention rate to  for further exploration juan camilo rojas international analyst at credicorp capital the fact that credit quotas are approved to obtain

able to give it a vision of business tourism and large events such as the world urban forumsantos does not rule out the sale of  of ecopetrol to finance the postconflict in the third debate of hora  de caracol radio in alliance with the lr newspaper the presiding candidate juan manuel santos did not rule out the sale of  of ecopetrol for a possible postconflict process if you are short of money for large infrastructure works would you leave another portion of ecopetrol it is not planned because they are public private partnerships ppp so what is designed is not for the state to put more money but then lets put it into the postconflict would you leave another piece of ecopetrol to finance any kind of need in principle i do not want to sell more percentages of ecopetrol but i do not want to commit myself not to do so if there is a need if for the country the profitability is much higher in some other investment then it would be done how will you finance the postconflict the calculations of all economists are that the growth of the economy will increase by  for life if we end the conflict the additional growth generates   trillion thats a lot of money if you add what we are doing in infrastructure it will generate an additional  then we are talking about  if today we are growing at  plus  is  the resources of the state will be very ample to be able to invest in schools in hospitals and the guerrillas will be demobilized in the countryside working and not shooting in the jungles are there risks that private property will be altered around cities that is part of that dirty propaganda that the enemies of peace are doing they say that the land is already being distributed for the guerrillas in the territories that surround the cities that is a lie they say that we are negotiating the army it is a lie the government presented  roads at the time as a kind of jewel in the crown but the financial design has them tangled  we have three tenders and there are proponents for all three so where is the problem and the sale of isagen of which the minister of finance had said that it was not to balance the financing  who said that isagen is not going to be sold it is out of the schedule  it is simply delayed but that does not mean that it will not be sold but if it is not sold colombia has such a positive situation in international markets that we could easily get those resources in debt how are you going to create more jobs and growth if you go electorally with the idea of taking away the tax benefits that employers have  but they are not incompatible we have managed to create  million jobs in this government in  months in a row no country on the planet has that if we achieve the growth rates you mentioned then we will be able to create those  million additional jobs if there is reelection are there also new faces in official positions or would they remain the same there would be some new faces and others that would continue but i have not defined yet i have a luxury cabinet luxury ministers would you name juan carlos echeverry again i would not have any problem or would you give continuity to mauricio cardenas i would not have any problem the minister of finance is already talking about restoring the wealth tax and taxing dividends that scares away investors what do you think of that if this country wants to be viable we need to continue with the policies so that the rich pay taxes is not bad i dont know if we are going to continue with the estate tax do you believe in juan jose jj rendon i believe that he is saying that he did not receive a single peso and i think that i have to believe him until they show me otherwise did you bring jj rendon to colombia no he was here a long time ago and i hired him here the party of national unity u has fared badly with the advisers ravi singh also ended up entangled the party of the u has won all the elections the constitutional court agrees with you saying that only through treaties can borders be modified if you get a second term would you be willing to carry out a border treaty with nicaragua  what follows will be to initiate a new negotiation with nicaragua for a new treaty but we are going to see what the courts ruling says to see how we proceed no hurryecopetrol claro and epm the top earners added   billion in profits oil and services were

had in  thanks to its execution the fall in the first semester could not be offset carlos rodriguez business specialists there are cases of negative figures that have an explanation such as cencosud which is fully adapting its infrastructure in the national territoryit would sell  of ecopetrol to finance infrastructure projects the candidate for the presidency for the conservative party marta lucia ramirez was in the presidential economic debate of the caracol radio program hora  and the newspaper la republica there he spoke of the inconvenience of the  tax the privatization of  of ecopetrol and who could be his minister of finance although he did not marry a name that of his advisor juan mario laserna rang out repeatedly recent political events have been called a dirty war do you think former president uribe is telling the truth about the  campaign when he says they received us   million to cover a deficit no no i dont know he says they told him but not that he knows it would be necessary to see if what they told him is true that there is an infiltration of a campaign that happened four years ago do you think that within the military forces these sectors are interested in sabotaging the peace process i don t believe i think that there are people who have concerns the most important thing and it would be good if the president made the negotiations known with more transparency when each chapter is finished here are two chapters that have been closed and details are not known what is the disadvantage of the country knowing them every day we see that there is more investment in advertising do you think that the campaign financing caps have been blown yes my campaign is the one with the lowest budget we have had to live with what the electoral council has given us in advance which is almost   million you have talked about the issue of peace that you want to restore democratic security how does that work i have said that i want a true democratic security policy that does not exist today the country has changed we must strengthen a citizen security policy peace will be achieved in colombia by strengthening institutions that have a rule of law i will be doing safety tips every day in different parts of the country promising four million jobs with the creation of  companies to achieve this you have to have very good economic advisers i have very good advisers we are going to dedicate ourselves to developing agroindustrial and manufacturing productive chains there is the science for the generation of employment will you tax dividends no would you renegotiate any trade agreements no it seems to me that we must dedicate ourselves to strengthening industry and agriculture yes i will apply safeguards antidumping and other mechanisms allowed by the world trade organization wto would it be  new companies in colombia  companies are created per year of those  disappear within two years what we want is to have a very complete market information system to guide the entire country where there are opportunities with the support of the state giving financing not subsidies or exemptions we can have about four million jobs there he had said that he would allocate  of the royalties no what we have said is that in order to invest in the field we believe that an important part of the royalties should be allocated what fundamental pillars would a structural tax reform bring i think that a good amount of exemptions must be eliminated what is the component of the income tax if it should be increased especially in people rather than in companies we are looking at the tax rate for the energy mining sector in different countries that are more competitive in this who would be your finance minister juan mario laserna has been appointed a lot  yes he is my advisor i have three candidates for the position what is your version of the minimum wage hopefully it is always a few points above the inflation rate but it is more important that there is more participation by workers for their productivity is the  tax going to keep it it is an antitechnical tax i find it inconvenient and would you sell the  of ecopetrol that is approved i think that  can be sold as long as there is government control these resources would be used for the infrastructure now that the isagen thing failed what it would never give is to give the infrastructure the resources of agriculture if you see that the state council puts a brake on the sale of isagen and the most ambitious project is underfunded what would you have done i go out and get into debtecopetrol would define in june whether pacific will win the rubiales contract once again the countdown is advancing for ecopetrol to define whether pacific rubiales will retain the operations contract for the rubiales field in the eastern plains the future of the countrys main oil region could be defined in june as it is expected that on that date the technical teams of the two companies will present a joint report on the results of said project the two oil companies met on april  and determined that the final balance would be delivered between  and  days later so the deputy minister of energy orlando cabrales estimates that the future of the agreement could be finalized by that date ecopetrols decision will depend on the profitability that pacific offers in the recovery of crude oil in other words in the capacity it has to improve the production levels of the field which today reaches about  barrels of oil per day on average bpdp however that is a time that ecopetrol measures imposed by the companys board of directors to analyze the results of the star technology pilot that the canadian is developing in the quifa field said cabrales what pacific has indicated with this development is that it could double the fields capacity so ecopetrol will have to evaluate if the goal is reached and if it can be replicated in rubiales if so the contract that runs until may  would be renewed however experts such as german corredor director of the national universitys energy observatory believe that ecopetrol should keep the fields operations and improve its performance this path will benefit the colombian companys income but will mean additional investments in technology for the exploitation of heavy crude another option is to terminate the contract with pacific but obtain the star technology and improve it through the provision of services because the foreign company has already patented it the important thing is whether or not there is a business case if technology shows that the recovery can be increased there is a case that will have to be assessed added cabrales everything will depend on the joint results delivered by the technicians of the oil companies thus june would be a key month for ecopetrol to define whether to leave the operations of the main oil field in colombia in the hands of pacific rubiales opinion orlando cabrales deputy minister of energy the important thing is whether or not there is a business case if technology says that recovery can be increased there is a case that will have to be assessedecopetrol launches a bond in dollars to  sources say the official said that at the end of the day ecopetrol would reveal the result of the operation this years investment plan of the oil company of us   million establishes a borrowing requirement of around us   million on april  ecopetrol received the governments endorsement to issue bonds in international markets for up to us   billion an authorization that will be valid until  shortly after the market opened ecopetrols share rose  to   on the colombian stock market ifr a thomson reuters information service revealed that the bonds initial yield guidance is in the  basis point area with deutsche bank and goldman sachs acting as lead brokers for the transaction ecopetrol was the colombian company that attracted the most resources in the local and international capital markets last yearecopetrol managed to capture us   billion in the international market ecopetrol has not yet confirmed the conditions under which the auction was held but sources say that these bonds with a maturity of  years that is  would have been placed at an interest rate of  the minister of finance mauricio cardenas spoke about the operation and assured that the operation was completely successful and that it confirms the good moment the national economy is going through in addition he made it clear that colombian companies are taking advantage of the good moment of the market to carry out issues of this natureecopetrol entered the international market and raised us   billion as soon as it was known that ecopetrol would go out yesterday to issue bonds in the international market all the experts assumed that the placement would be a success something that was finally confirmed since the oil company had a quota of us   million and in the end after the operation everything had been placed before knowing the results it was expected that the figure placed by the oil company would not be equal to the total available quota but would capture an amount between us   billion and us   billion from the market ecopetrol launched a bond issue and the placement was a total success it should be noted that it is an issuance of us   million in  bonds the maximum term that a colombian issuer has made he took advantage of the good moment of our economy  affirmed mauricio cardenas minister of finance according to the results the company registered an overdemand of five times in its titles which made it finally take advantage of everything available the companies are deciding on the fly and what has been seen is that requests for more than us   billion were received ecopetrol saw the opportunity since that appetite led to financing at a very positive rate for such longterm securities of  says juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores of course when you see the figure you might think that the company would be taking on a large debt but the market did not see it that way taking into account the size of the company this is a normal debt figure and more so considering that it made the money with good market conditions says daniel lozano head of economic studies at serfinco ecopetrol will use these resources to meet mainly the cash flow needs of the company in us dollars derived from its investment plan the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrez stated that we are very satisfied with this issue which shows confidence in the company and in the country faced with this the companys securities on the colombian stock exchange showed a  devaluation which caused the price of each share to end at the close of the day at   this operation will benefit the population according to cardenas popular achieved a demand of  times what was awarded banco popular also went to the capital market with a bond issue in which it captured   million which represents an overdemand of  times what was awarded since requests were received for   million among the series the one with a maturity of  months ended with a cutoff rate of  nominal month overdue while the one with  months an interest rate of  both tied to the ibr but it is not the only entity that will be in the international financial system as it was learned yesterday davivienda is working to obtain additional financing from the ifc which would be for an approximate amount of us   million and would be made towards the second half of the yeari will not sell  of ecopetrol you have to look at the generation from other sources the candidate for the presidency for the democratic center oscar ivan zuluaga participated on monday in the economic debate of the hora  program of caracol radio and the newspaper la republica in it zuluaga acknowledged that the meeting with the hacker andres sepulveda occurred but assured that it was a setup on the economic issue the candidate says that he will not sell  of ecopetrol he will maintain taxes such as  and equity he will stimulate investment and will not renegotiate any signed fta are you the one in the video we were infiltrated in this campaign a montage with illegal recordings has been made we have denounced with specific aspects and i have asked as a victim that i am of this fact that an investigation be carried out to specify with all the decorum what it is showing this video i prefer to wait because there is a very delicate fact i was there that day i went to the office on april  thats correct but i want to specify what the scope is but you are the one who appears in the video and that is your voice  i went to that office that corresponds to the truth and i went to make a visit like many others do you remember talking about those topics i do not have a graphic recall of the topics that were discussed this office was giving us support in terms of social networks and democratic security we went to talk to meet they talked about general issues it was a visit like many others but is the one in the video you or is he an imposter that is what we want to specify in the assembly clearly they take me to a meeting where there is an attitude to make an illegal recording and that is what we are going to clarify with all the expert opinion that is being advanced we want to determine how the video is given what is the purpose how it is given illegally sepulveda spoke to you about some issues of where the farc could be and you asked what the santos campaign is planning for may  do you remember asking that that is why we want to specify the scope of that video very well many people who have seen that video regardless of the result of the investigation have expressed that there is no illegal manifestation or expression or what was said in that meeting corresponds to some involvement in judicial matters how is your proposal in the process in havana i would not discuss drug policy with the worlds leading drug cartel i decree a provisional suspension of the talks in havana i give the farc eight days to decide if they want a negotiated peace they have to suspend all criminal actions against colombians for the sake of peace with them we can talk about reduction of sentences i have an attitude towards negotiated peace but with demand economic analysts agree that you had some responsibility in dmg and interbolsa what role did he play at that time it was a difficult time we detected that dmg was a criminal company and when we found out progress was made to deactivate that structure will you sell  of ecopetrol no i think that first you have to look at the generation capacity of internal sources for example it would review economic crimes they represent between us   million and us   million it is a challenge to justice to appropriate many more resources will you keep the  im going to keep the  and the estate tax dividend tax  no i prefer wealth tax would you give exemptions to entrepreneurs i am a friend of the stimulus to investment on some requirements generation of formal employment stability will you renegotiate mining royalties you have to sit down and look at the rules that govern them because investment in mining is declining today will the retirement age go up im not going to upload it there is a very serious problem only  of those who contribute are going to retire it is a countersense to increase their ages the true pension reform is to bring young people to the formal and labor system what are you going to do with the ftas are you going to affirm more are you going to renegotiate them i do not sign new ones nor am i going to renegotiate it seems to me that they must be fulfilled what you have to do is prepare the sectors that are going to be affected by the ftas so that they can compete how to do with the fta with the united states which already shows a negative balance  we must develop a modern agricultural sector a reconversion and think about a new exportable offer in the agricultural sector that has great opportunities in the united states are you going to remove the special regime for the military and teachers no i preserve what is in the constitution both for the military and for teachers you promised to raise the minimum wage by how much did you marry a figure we are reviewing the issue there is a commitment on how to improve the minimum wage but reviewing the cost structure of companies so that this will not destroy employment profile of the candidate oscar ivan zuluaga zuluaga is the presidential candidate for the democratic center he is an economist from the universidad javeriana and has a masters degree in public finance he was senator in  and  minister of finance between  and  before entering politics he worked in a family business in  he worked to create the partido de la uecopetrol is still ecopetrol the words of the minister of finance mauricio cardenas to the media were eloquent ecopetrol launched a bond issue and the placement was a total success it should be noted that it is an issuance of us   million in  bonds the maximum term that a colombian issuer has made he took advantage of the good moment of our economy  the message is clear and forceful that it goes beyond being a snapshot of the economic moment and leaves important reflections for investors and economic actors the first is heard by the candidates for the presidency of the republic when they speak without measure of what they are going to do with the other tranche of actions that have been approved by congress for privatization several of the five candidates for the house of narino have expressed their intention to sell another piece of ecopetrol a message that will become financial imperative in the course of a few weeks if any of them win the elections let us remember that the share of the mixed state company is the one that weighs the most in the basket of variable income papers in the colombian stock exchange and that the companys profits are one of the largest sources of financing for the national budget hence any decision regarding the oil company must be measured and respectful the direct message is ecopetrol should not be tampered with especially after when it was known that ecopetrol would go out to issue bonds in the international market all the experts assumed that the placement would be a success something that was finally confirmed since the oil company had a quota of us   million and at the end of the operation everything had been placed and the purchase intention exceeded us   billion the company posted a fivefold overdemand on its securities at a very positive rate for such longterm securities of  when seeing the successes of the placement it could be analyzed that the company is getting into debt but the market did not see it that way the colombian multilatina company with a presence in brazil peru and mexico will use these resources to mainly meet the cash flow needs in dollars derived from its investment plan the dark side of the play is that the shares in the stock market presented a devaluation of  which made the price of each share average   but this occurred in the short term because in the long term the benefits for shareholders they will be superior the only thing that can sow a cloud of uncertainty is that the irresponsible candidates for the presidency of colombia begin to show the most important company in the country and one of the most admired and valued by international lists of corporate reputationpetrolera ecopetrol has a patent to produce biocetane the national company ecopetrol received a technology patent that will allow it to diversify the production of biofuels this was confirmed by the superintendency of industry and commerce sic the entity that granted these exclusive rights it is a new biofuel that the colombian petroleum institute developed after two years of research and that can be obtained in the conventional plants of the refinery this received the name biocetano a title already registered loading vegetable oil directly into plants to produce fuels of biological origin is an unprecedented fact in the world oil industry and this achievement was made by ecopetrol by developing a new product that will be added to diesel in colombia the firm highlighted in september  when he released the news obtaining the socalled renewable diesel involves the addition of hydrogen to crude palm oil hydrotreating a process that is carried out in exclusive plants for the purification of hydrocarbons before the new method was discovered refineries could only load fossil hydrocarbons to generate derivatives ecopetrols biocetane has not only been presented as a high quality product but also stands out for its zero sulfur status which constitutes a competitive advantage however the caveat is made that the same technology could not be applied to other organic raw materials that generate oils such as algae another added value according to the company is that only a few adjustments in the processes are necessary so that a reduction in costs is guaranteed what differentiates it from biodiesel is that it requires transforming oils into transportation fuels by adding alcohol in plants designed for this purpose with the possibility of obtaining it in the conventional plants of the refinery new investments in plants are not required for the implementation of this development the oil company explained in a letter today with this recognition ecopetrol completes three patents so far this year for processes that generate alternatives in the production of biofuels together with those for obtaining fermentable sugars from microalgae and macroalgae and the process for the production of glycerin ethers from liquefied petroleum gas lpg stream of olefinic type ecopetrol is the company that has applied for the most patents in colombia since  but it also has another  granted in countries such as venezuela ecuador brazil the united states mexico china peru nigeria and russia the invention patent applies to the improved method for obtaining diesel from renewable sources by controlling the level of unsaturation and is in force from august   to august   according to the sicwalmart is  times ecopetrol a versus that defines the two economies among the top ten companies in the us and colombia there is an abyss of figures and three trends that show the interests and possibilities of each economy so far apart that the operating income in  of the first colombian ecopetrol of us   million it would fit  times inside walmart a leading us company that made us   million last year american companies have just upgraded to fortune magazines top  ranking with little change in rankings it is a heterogeneous composition that leads the walmart trade whose revenues increased  over the previous year on the other side the leader is also growing but at a faster rate that caused ecopetrols operating income to increase  but there the similarities end and understanding the implications of the divergences leads to three closely related trends in the landscape of colombian companies in lack of diversity the size of the largest taking as a reference the gross domestic product gdp and the share of the been in them lack of diversity a quick glance is enough to see this after walmart exxonmobil chevron berkshire hathaway and apple complete the us winning five ranging from us   million in  to us   million in the fifth analyzed by sectors we talk about retail hydrocarbons textiles and technology many different pieces if we compare in national territory with ecopetrol epm terpel exito and pacific rubiales have in the first place much more modest figures from us   million for ecopetrol to us   million for pacific rubiales what can be seen in the categorization is the development model in which the country has been blocked for a decade the extraction of natural resources macroeconomic health depends on the success of hydrocarbon exploitation said luis fernando ramirez vicerector for economic research at la salle university and that is a doubleedged sword since the fall in the price of commodities will have consequences for companies as german corredor director of the national university energy observatory points out the diversity of the united states makes its productive fabric less vulnerable to international situations despite the good times companies such as exxon or chevron present variations of  and  in the us where paradoxically production increases every year the oil industry in the us grew in unconventional exploration fields precisely where it seems that these companies do not work said corredor dominant size of the leaders the concentration of the percentage contribution in the first company in the colombian list is almost equal to the total percentage contribution of the top  us companies said carlos hernan gonzalez business analyst at the university from the valley to better understand this relationship its comparison with gdp is enough ecopetrols revenues are equivalent to  of colombian gdp and the percentages of the  largest should be added to the united states gdp to reach a similar figure despite the size of the us economy whose gdp is estimated at us   million its largest company does not exceed  of the national accounts in size a high public presence public control and mixed composition are especially noticeable in colombia where more than  of the economy is in the hands of the state as ramirez highlights thus the public presence has a direct impact on the consumer as fabio moscoso professor of international economics at ean university explains in colombia we have a high level of monopolization and oligopolies the economy is quite protected and that makes final consumer goods more expensive said this expert this explains why exito is so relegated  place compared to its us counterpart walmart the operating income of colombian stores us   million would represent  of the national gdp partly also because consumers as moscoso explained go to small stores and neighborhood stores to reduce costs although as ramirez warns  trade is developing where are the industrial and financial sectors most of the experts consulted are surprised that the industry is not present in the list of the top ten companies in colombia except for argos which in corredors words is the productive sector par excellence and would reduce the vulnerability of the economy nor is the financial sector which according to ramirez is experiencing significant growth and will play an important role in the short term as it continues to grow both sectors are conducive to greater competition so its entry into the top ten national companies will change the landscape opinions german corredor director of the energy observatory of the national university just as we have years of good prices in commodities we must be careful it is not about change but about promoting other sectors  carlos hernan gonzalez business analyst at the universidad del valle the concentration of the percentage weight in the first colombian company is almost equal to the total percentage weight of the top  companies in the united states luis fernando ramirez vicerector for economic research u la salle without a doubt colombian companies reflect the development model in which the country has been blocked for a decade supported by natural resourcesavianca ecopetrol and bancolombia with the best regional projection to grow avianca ecopetrol and bancolombia are the colombian companies with the best growth prospects for the next five years at a national and regional level as they also lead in latin america thanks to the note obtained by the country  points out of  which place colombia ahead of mexico  brazil  chile  and argentina  the results correspond to a survey carried out by proi worldwide of  journalists and directors of economic and political communication media in the region their responses indicate their perception of which will be the fastest growing in the next five years an idea that is not necessarily based on their most recent financial results the paradox is especially observed in the case of brazil where petrobras made sales of some us   billion in  far from the other two companies with more possibilities gerdau with us   billion and ambev with us   billion they are companies with international transactions which came from being small companies to be the most taken into account in latin america with the ability to go out and compete in any market explained mauricio ferro director of position communications a member agency of proi worldwide in colombia and it is precisely the international competition that reinforces the visibility of these and other latin american companies such as the mexican cemex which recently starred in an asset exchange with holcim in europe the brazilian giant petrobras or the chilean falabella avianca identifies itself as a more latin american than colombian company as a result of the expansion to brazil and ecuador with globalization air transport becomes more necessary and they also complement that niche with hotel and transport services said gerardo mejia who works as a business analyst and financial vicerector of the national university bancolombia also registered expansive news recalled the president of the entity carlos raul yepes we are focused on continuing to improve our portfolio of products and services in central america we have a budget for  close to us   million the investment for bancolombia will be greater than us   million for banco agricola it will be more than us   million and banistmo will have a budget of close to us   million said yepes as for the rest of the regional companies the majority are multilatinas america movil femsa arcor or leaders in their sector as is the case of the chilean stateowned codelco a copper producer however two other colombian companies grupo exito and nutresa also stand out in the report not because of their expansion possibilities but because of their communication and reputation rates above  a jewel that few companies have the same colombian journalists said that companies plan less for crises and their communication than those from outside a journalist communicates easier with brazilian companies than colombian ones the presidents of companies in colombia think that only two people can handle their communications when they must also be involved said ferro thus official statements become real pearls rare and difficult to obtain for the press due to the availability of the agendas of the main executives in colombia they are still very much based on advertising added ferro this activity can help increase business capabilities by up to  said the account manager of the advertising agency tbwa colombia sol lopez de tejada the bases that influence the activity of a company are consumer knowledge communication and pricing the correct management of these three axes in a disruptive and coherent way leads the company to exponential growth  said this expert relying on this resource has been in the last two years a time of greater colombian business expansion more necessary with the free trade agreements fta which according to lopez de tejada has led to an understanding of their business abroad and this has allowed them to adapt more quickly  the report identifies brazilian mexican and argentine companies as the best in communication and relationship with their public something that additionally prepares them better to face crisis situations opportunities consistent with gdp growth the possibilities for business expansion are related to the macroeconomic opportunities of a country and its most relevant indicator the growth of the gross domestic product gdp according to the latest projections of the international monetary fund imf of the countries analyzed by proi worldwide colombia would have the best opportunities in  with an estimated growth of  chile would follow with  mexico which achieves more than double that of the previous year and would add  brazil with  and finally argentina with an estimate of  the experts consulted highlight the good moment that colombia is going through for international perception highlighted in foreign publications opinions mauricio ferro director of position communications member of proi worldwide in colombia today colombian companies are entering international markets their good management is what allows them to be great at any level  gerardo mejia business analyst and financial vicerector at the national university in the perception of the country government policies have a lot of value and it is clear how opening up to foreign investment has given great advantages carlos raul yepes president of bancolombia the recent acquisitions banistmo and  of grupo agromercantil de guatemala are a source of growth with significant expectations we are consolidating ecopetrol launches an offer to buy gasoline shipments for july the andean country has increased its fuel imports in recent months after its cartagena refinery with a capacity for  barrels of crude oil per day bpd began an important

that is coming this measure has been requested from his union as a need we have not had any doubts in asking for a tax reform that collects what is necessary  of the national gdp so that areas such as health and pensions can be covered he emphasized likewise he ruled out that the health system should be made completely public for fear of this generating greater corruption of the system that

colombian oil company will be able to define whether to renew pacifics operations in the rubiales field the contract in that area is agreed until  but the canadian wants to expand it to increase the production of the field that today generates about  barrels of oil per day on average bpdp however ecopetrol has yet to make a decision telling pacific on a previous occasion that there were still concerns about the benefits of the technology in fact at the beginning of this year the criticism from the union and the alarms from the comptrollers office intensified due to the risks that the technology represented but pacific has not given its arm to twist and has maintained the tests in the field according to bloomberg the company led by ronald pantin is already finishing applying the pilot in the quifa field it is not yet known when the contract will be defined but the issue could be discussed at the next ecopetrol board of directors which will be held on the second friday in july

yearecopetrol would reduce the ordinary dividend and eliminate the extraordinary dividend for  the first six months of the year have not been the best for ecopetrol constant attacks on its infrastructure have generated a decrease in production and therefore a negative behavior of the title on the stock exchange colombian securities bvc a situation that if maintained could lead to a reduction in the ordinary dividend and the elimination of the extraordinary dividend this year according to figures from the colombian petroleum association acp to date  attacks have taken place that have affected the flow of oil operations a lower number than the  reported in  but which are ultimately worrying because in the eyes of investors terrorists every time they want to put the company in check ecopetrol estimates that as a result of the attacks  million barrels of oil have not been transported if this accumulated is calculated with an average price of us   per barrel the figure rises to us   million values that will significantly affect the second quarter results that the company will deliver in the coming weeks the current panorama with lower production will generate that the dividend for next year will decrease to   per share justified in a lower price of the title which could be around levels between   and   explained julian villamizar professor at the externado university from colombia he added that this could occur as a response to the greater risk perceived by investors due to a higher level of debt and years of reserves of between  or  years if significant discoveries are not made cesar cuervo oil  gas analyst at credicorp capital agrees with what villamizar says also considers that the reduction of the production goal in the  mediumterm fiscal framework up to  barrels per day compared to the  million reached in  they realize that the government hopes that the results will not be the best with the company oil revenues fall by  of gdp between  and  such behavior responds to the expected decrease in production in the current year the decrease in the price of the crude oil basket and higher production costs the document noted since  the year in which the stock was listed on the bvc prices have maintained an upward trend according to bloomberg data in  the largest advance was presented going from   in january to   in december that is a  appreciation however the stock did not reach a ceiling at that value and it was on june   when the highest value was registered   a date that meant for those who bought the title in the first years a valuation of more than   beginning of the decline from that price of   today there are only memories because according to the close on friday the stock ended the week at   that is it has fallen about  with respect to that value now what its more than  shareholders are wondering is what to do with the shares of the oil company or what will happen to the company the answer like everything that happens in the stock market is uncertain although according to the fundamental analysis carried out by experts at the moment there is nothing to indicate that the security will rise in price for fabio echeverri who served for more than  years on the board of directors of the state company no company called ecopetrol or another can generate production and profits under a scenario of war and insecurity like the one that has been observed most likely if this scenario continues income and production will decrease  in the first quarter of the year the company was affected by public order problems and the drop in the price of crude oil according to the report presented in may the profit fell  compared to the first quarter of  that is the oil company obtained a profit of   billion between january and march  the problems in the the cano limoncovenas oil pipeline was the one that caused the greatest damage since it was stopped for two months and it is estimated that due to the attack transportation costs rose  if the problems persist and they affect the companys profit it is likely that ecopetrol will have to reduce or even cut the dividend for its shareholders however we have to wait for the rest of the year to be able to determine this  explained alvaro younes president of fedispetrol another fact that causes concern is the decrease in cash flow compared to the previous year as well as the increase in the companys liabilities the general balance of consolidated liabilities shows that as of march   these were located at   billion that is they increased  from the   billion on december  of last year at the end of the first quarter liabilities represented  of assets reflecting an increase of   billion on the other hand if the companys cash flow is analyzed a decrease can be observed in the first quarter of  compared to the previous year the final cash position was   trillion   trillion less than in  when the company had   trillion available the increase in debt during the first three months of the year is due to the distribution of  of profits and although most of it goes to the government one could think of some alternative to reduce the amount said camilo silva  valora inversiones analyst in total the nation will receive in  more than   billion in dividends while minority shareholders will receive   billion we will have to wait if the trend continues next year rise in crude oil would alleviate the situation the behavior in the value of oil in recent weeks has been highly volatile as a result of the tension in iraq the price in the value of a barrel of wti and brent crude in june started with sharp falls however after the problems in iraq became known and given the concern about a global shortage the values until july have maintained an upward trend at the end of the edition the price of wti closed at us   while brent ended at us   values that logically when sold represent more income for the companies that work with the material and therefore increase the value in profits and also in stocks opinions alvaro younes chairman of fedispetrol if the problems persist and these affect the companys profit it is likely that ecopetrol will have to reduce or even cut its dividends julian villamizar professor at the externado de colombia university the current outlook would cause next years dividend to decrease to   per share as a result of the depreciation of the oil companys titleecopetrol share accumulated a decline in the year of  the ecopetrol share maintains its downward trend and has accumulated a decrease of  so far this year the fall in the price of the security in recent weeks is due to the fact that the market began to discount the fact that the results of the second quarter will be below the budgeted as this newspaper had already expressed the report will be released at the end of the month at the close of the day on the colombian stock exchange bvc the species with the highest trading volume was that of the oil company with   million although with a negative variation in its price of  to close at    pacific rubiales did not do well on the day either and accumulated one of the most important falls the

average price of   which represented an increase of   compared to the representative market rate trm which stood at   this rebound is in line with what the market expected and after the federal reserve fed meeting in which the minutes were discussed it is estimated that the stimulus purchase plan will end in october a fact that it would maintain the trend for the rest of the week the dollar started the day with a price of   and its closing price was   the minimum rate registered was   while the maximum was   the amount negotiated was us   million in  operationsecopetrol loses ground in colcap and the financial sector takes center stage the poor performance of ecopetrols share so far this year has caused its participation in the colcap basket to decrease and now it is the financial sector that is gaining prominence the year has been difficult for the most important oil company in the country constant attacks against its infrastructure have decreased production added to the lack of discoveries have generated a decline in the value of its share of  closing on thursday at    this fact has caused the companys participation in the colcap basket to decrease considerably from the beginning of the second quarter until july  since it went from having a participation of  to  which means that has fallen  but the bad hour is not only for the colombian state oil company canacol energy also presented changes in the basket for the second quarter it went from  to  daniel escobar director of economic research at global securities explained that this decline is due to the fact that the weights in the stock market are not rigid and the composition is based on the closing of the shares and therefore the variation affects the weighting final  that is to say that the constant falls in the security have generated its decline in the index among other things otherwise it happens with the preferred shares of bancolombia and grupo sura which despite a difficult start to the year have recovered and have had increases of  and  closing on thursday at   and   respectively the good performance of the securities in the first six months has generated that the companies have a participation in colcap of  and  taking advantage of the decline of ecopetrol being less exposed to the shares of the oil companies in the index is something positive because for example the financial and construction sectors have had a considerable reputation said juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores he added that the diversification of the index in this case is good because not all the titles have fallen and some are pushing the bottom to the point that it registers a positive variation of  cementos argos preferential also performed well in the year as a result of the boom in infrastructure works and went from  to  july rebalancing for the third quarter basket no major significant changes are expected in the recomposition of the stake however if there would be a species exchange in the index according to alianza valores for the period between august and october the preferential exit of grupo sura would be presented and the ordinary one would enter this would imply a sale flow of the preferred class of   million and a purchase flow of the ordinary class of   million said ballen additionally at the july cutoff the ordinary species of cemargos would replace the preferential title the two changes are the result of the increase in the volumes traded by common shares in the third quarter the trend would continue according to a report by global securities for the third quarter of the year the colcap basket would be led by ecopetrol with  participation however if the history is analyzed the level is very far from what the company was accustomed to since for a long time it had  participation the maximum that can be had bancolombia grupo sura and grupo argos preferred the first places with participation of   and  respectively the publication date of the information basket will be july  and the final basket will be announced on july  after the market close opinions juan david ballen equity analyst at alianza valores being less exposed to the shares of oil companies in the index is a positive thing because it diversifies and others take center stage daniel escobar director of research at global securities the decline in participation in the index is due to the fact that there is daily trading the closings affect the final weightingecopetrol will define this month if it approves the use of star technology this month will be final for ecopetrols board of directors to decide whether to approve the star technology that pacific rubiales has tested in the quifa field in the eastern plains the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta confirmed yesterday that the oil company will make a decision in the coming days the organizations were scheduled to meet today for pacific to support the results of the technical report it delivered to ecopetrol but they postponed it until next tuesday the meeting will be at four in the afternoon and there will be no more deadlines the company did not want to make a decision without first hearing them so after that an extraordinary meeting will be called to announce a decision that should be defined this month said the minister what happens with star technology will also be key for the canadian operations in the rubiales field in the eastern plains and whose operations contract expires on may   initially pacific sought to demonstrate that it could double capacity of production in the field thanks to the technology so that ecopetrol renewed the contract however acosta confirmed yesterday that the oil company sent the presidency of ecopetrol a communication in which they stated that they had no interest in continuing with the extension of the contract but the canadian does not want to give up all business in colombias main producing field  barrels of oil a day on average bpdp that is why he proposed a new agreement to ecopetrol that it operate the field and keep  of the basic production but that they use star technology to improve recovery that additional production that is achieved would be shared between the two oil companies the issue is being studied by the board of directors which first wants to define whether or not they will use the technology acosta said but the idea already sounds to the sector hernando barrero president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet said that the most convenient thing for the country is for ecopetrol to operate the field and he added that the oil company could work with the technology that pacific presents or develop its own strategy to increase the recovery capacity we must not forget that one of the most important research centers in the country is the colombian petroleum institute icp which belongs to ecopetrol these technicians and experts will be able to work on other innovations to increase production  highlighted barrero the other operations will continue while the board of directors of ecopetrol makes a decision pacific rubiales will continue with its operations in quifa the third oil producing field with  bpdp if the board approves the technology the recovery in that area could also double the decision will be in the hands of the board composed of mauricio cardenas minister of finance amylkar acosta minister of mines and energy and tatyana orozco director of the national planning department dnp the independent members roberto steiner representative of the minority shareholders jorge pinzon and joaquin moreno and the executives gonzalo restrepo chairman of the board horacio ferreira representative of the producing departments and luis fernando ramirez it is expected that this time it will be determined what will happen to star technology as the sector awaits a decision more than a year ago message was not positive for the market pacific rubiales

the sale of  of ecopetrol is not in our plans it is not a priority at this time we have to focus on completing the isagen sale transaction which we hope will happen very soon how are they going to maintain an exchange rate that benefits both exporters and importers we continue to think that the equilibrium exchange rate is   pesos and we will do everything necessary to get closer to that level it is the rate that would allow colombian exporters to compete and also the countrys businessmen to have the possibility of facing imports is the idea of eliminating the three zeros of the colombian

years ago and that on the contrary the tests carried out over  months show that the pilot project successfully met the objectives for which it was designed  in response the senator said that the data clearly refer to production as of october   it is irresponsible that they want to question the official figures of the star project to present as successful what failed and more if it is intended

valora inversiones indicated that for two months the market has been attentive to what happens with technology and for a week we have seen very high nervousness and significant misinformation about approval or not he indicated that different messages have been given from the congressmans communication to crossinformation from the oil companies and interviews with the minister of mines that show that the issue would not be approved for his part sebastian gallego oil and gas analyst at credicorp capital indicated that this issue has generated considerable uncertainty and that is why the actions of the two companies have had a negative behavior the truth is that ecopetrol reiterated in communication to the superintendency that indeed robledos figures are preliminary and that they continue to evaluate the results of the pilot test discovery in the gulf of mexico ecopetrol discovered oil in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico in the united states through a partnership with

but david villan senior analyst for oil and energy equities at actions and values indicated that the statements published by the firms explaining that the figures released by senator jorge robledo that took the projects failure for granted were preliminary they generated calm in the markets and this week the shares of the two oil companies have stabilized the titles of the canadian closed the day yesterday higher with a variation of  and those of ecopetrol remained stable pacific spokespersons explained to lr that the preliminaries exposed to the public opinion do not correspond to the pilot test these are results that occurred after testing  wells near the rural area of puerto gaitan in the eastern plains with characteristics other than quifa at the same time they regretted that a subject as technical as star has become politicized the different versions regarding the reception of the project have not only generated an impact on the actions of the oil company they have also caused doubts about its continuity in the local market mainly because the extension of the contract that allows the company is not certain canada operate   barrels per day of campo rubiales the contract expires on may   ecopetrol has not commented on the matter the minister of mines amylkar acosta said that today the meeting will not talk about the contract but recalled that the main oil company in the country is able to operate the entire rubiales field at the moment due to the business with pacific it only exploits  german corredor director of the energy observatory indicated that the fact that pacific is left without the rubiales field does not necessarily mean that it leaves the country because although it is true it is the largest field and it will undoubtedly decrease its participation in the field market you can keep producing and exploring in fact the company is authorized to participate in the  colombia round that begins today and will auction  conventional and unconventional wells in the opinion of minister acosta although each of the board members had the opportunity to review the technical report presented by pacific the concept offered by ecopetrol technicians and the third parties that were hired will be final today at the meeting we all arrived with the report examined so we hope to have a decision on star we are open to the considerations of the technicians about the quifa field pilot said the portfolio manager ronda colombia in an environment of insecurity in the midst of the latest attacks on the oil infrastructure in putumayo cano limon covenas pipeline and the governments concern about the drop in production for which they are evaluating a shock plan today it will be carried out the hearing for the opening of proposals for the

expected to deliver between  and  of the blocks of which  are conventional  are unconventional and  are offshore opinions alejandro martinez president of the acp there are two ways to increase reserves through exploratory investments and take advantage of existing fields there star would be a very good alternative alejandra mendez stock analyst at serfinco the news of star technology can be a catalyst and could affect the stock in the short term depending on the results of todays meetingboth pacific and ecopetrol will continue with the analysis of star technology the owner made it very clear that neither party nor the government is disqualifying or qualifying this technology however ecopetrol decided to terminate the pilot with pacific the company that holds the patent which began in november  and although it was to end in october  it was extended until yesterday when after reviewing the technical studies both parties agreed to terminate the tests the minister explained that what follows is the formation of a technical team that will carry out a study to make the respective evaluation and obtain information that will be very useful and the knowledge around the system called in situ combustion pacific operates the field quifa for that reason they are in the intention of advancing in this technology  indicated acostapacific rubiales and ecopetrol shares open sharply down on thursday july  the two companies reported through the financial superintendency that the star enhanced recovery pilot project which the canadian company had been developing since  was concluded the statement explains that the decision was made to adopt the recommendations included in the technical report prepared on june   called pacific rubiales energy  ecopetrol sa joint meeting review of star project technical results  pacifics share was trading at   and ecopetrols at   last night the market was expectant about how this pronouncement was going to affect the companies titles after the statement was released there was confusion about the future of the pilot project pacific through its twitter reported that in agreement with ecopetrol announces the continuity of the star project analysisecopetrol does not rule out star or other technologies to increase production star technology is one of the many available in the world to achieve this as long as the association with pacific rubiales exists in quifa and rubiales it is in the interest of both companies to increase production and the recovery factor and for this technological alternatives will be explored  said this morning acosta at the end of his intervention in the sixth oil  gas conference which is taking place between today and tomorrow in cartagena the announcement comes after both companies announced on thursday the completion of the star enhanced recovery pilot project in the quifa field considering that it compiled the generation of information for the evaluation of the project and reached the final date approved  according to the official the primary interest of both firms is to increase the recovery factor that is a higher percentage of crude oil extraction and if for this it is essential that this or any technology be used ecopetrol is open to considering it but no decision has been made he said however the head of the portfolio added that the contract between the stateowned company and the canadian in the rubiales field is another matter and that it is not at all related to the decision of star technology in quifa for now the association contract in rubiales must be reversed in  and in due course ecopetrol will have access to how it will continue to develop that deposit or if alliances are sought with others but there is no link he insistedecopetrol and pacific shares fell after the announcement of suspending star technology the news of the completion of the star pilot project which pacific rubiales was developing in ecopetrols quifa field generated a depreciation in the value of both companies shares and although the use of technology has not been ruled out everything indicates that the stock market assumes that it would not serve as expected during thursdays trading session on the colombian stock exchange bvc the titles of the colombian oil company and the canadian company fell  and  to close at   and   respectively these decreases represent an accumulated depreciation so far this year of  for ecopetrol and positive for pacific in  which shows that  has not been entirely good for the companies on wednesday and after a ninehour meeting the board of directors of ecopetrol and pacific rubiales concluded that the star enhanced recovery pilot project was terminated after considering that the technology complied with the generation of information for the evaluation of the project and arrived to the approved final date  for cesar cuervo oil  gas analyst at credicorp capital this decision was surprising for some but not for others what follows is an ex post study which means that the project is still evaluating and part of the market assumes that the technology would not work as expected at the beginning of the day the shares of ecopetrol and pacific rubiales opened with strong declines at  in the morning the colombian title fell  while that of the canadian fell  the technical study prepared on june  by the two oil companies and called joint meeting review of technical results of the star project indicated that the recovery factor for the project completion date october   is found between  and  it is very difficult to say whether the technology is beneficial or not however if the first tests that have been carried out are taken into account the recovery factor is higher than the national average and that would undoubtedly generate greater production and report higher profits said luis ernesto mejia former minister of mines and energy  currently the average recovery rate in colombia for heavy crude is around  star seeks that these levels reach a  or  recovery rate julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines and energy considers that it is too hasty to say whether the technology is viable or not when one develops or implements technologies there are three stages of evaluation the first at the laboratory level if it is feasible it goes to a pilot test like the one that was developed and finally if the first two points were met and these were satisfactory  it is taken to the industry and applied to different wells and fields  for the moment the use of technology in ecopetrols fields has not been ruled out and according to the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta in this scenario neither this nor any other technology that makes it possible to increase the recovery rate  although acosta emphasized that the decision made by the oil company focused on the pilot project company sources assured reuters that the decision implies not applying star technology in quifa one of the largest oil fields in the country stock outlook the recommendation by analysts with respect to the pacific rubiales and ecopetrol securities is to buy the former and keep the latter from credicorp capital the recommendation for these two titles has not changed despite the news the reason is that there is nothing that indicates from the fundamental analysis that the shares are going to rise or fall analysts expectations for the canadian company are fluctuating due to the volatility of the securities during  however according to juan david ballen analyst at alianza valores pacific has a little more chance at this time to present better results than its peers in the specific case of ecopetrol constant attacks on its infrastructure have generated a decrease in production and therefore a negative performance of the title according to figures from the colombian petroleum association acp to date there have been more than  attacks that have affected the flow of oil operations a figure lower than the  reported in  but in definitively they are worrying because in the eyes of investors terrorists every time they want to put the company in check on wednesday the ombudsmans office reported that on the road that connects orito and puerto asis alleged members of the guerrilla caused the dumping of  gallons of oil equivalent to  barrels which belonged to the state company ecopetrol estimates that as a result of the attacks  million barrels of oil have not been transported if this accumulated is calculated with an average price of us   per barrel the figure rises to us   million values that will significantly affect the second quarter results that the company will deliver next week as you can see the outlook for companies is not the best and they will have to find deposits or increase production in order to improve their results crude price would help in the results the behavior in the value of oil in recent weeks has had a strong volatility as a result of the tensions that occur in iraq and ukraine the price in the value of a barrel of wti and brent crude in june started with sharp falls however after knowing the problems in the world and before the concern about a global shortage the values until july have maintained an upward trend at the end of the edition the price of wti closed at us   while brent ended at us   values that logically when sold represent more income for companies opinions cesar cuervo credicorp capital analyst the project will continue to be evaluated and part of the stock market assumes that the technology would not serve as expected luis ernesto mejia former minister of mines and energy it is very difficult to say whether technology is beneficial or not although with the tests the recovery factor is higher than the national average uncertainty about ecopetrols profits remains next thursday the financial results of the second quarter and first half of the main company in colombia ecopetrol will be known this year has not been the most favorable for the oil company both in fundamental data and in the share price so the uncertainty about its results remains in the market according to a survey by lr among eight stockbrokers the profit for the second quarter would be   billion on average that is when added to that of the first quarter it would result in   billion figure   lower compared to june  where they reported   billion the reasons for the decline in its profits are derived from the difficult situation that the company has had to face this year numerous attacks on its infrastructure negative results in terms of exploration increases in transportation costs among other things are some of the problems it has had to overcome the problems of public order and constant terrorist attacks on the oil infrastructure would overshadow the results and the advance that the price of crude oil had due to the crisis in iraq where the wti rose  and the brent  said juan david ballen  analyst at alianza valores according to figures from the colombian petroleum association acp to date there have been more than  attacks that have affected the flow of oil operations ecopetrol estimates that as a result of the attacks four million barrels of oil could not be transported that if they are counted on average at us   per barrel there would be a loss of more than us   million among the brokers consulted the one that expects the worst scenario in terms of second quarter earnings is ultraburstiles   trillion while corredores asociados is the most optimistic   billion in production the company is expected to announce significant drops in its report ultraburstiles considers that between the first and second quarters the country stopped producing about  barrels if ecopetrol absorbed a loss between  and  the oil companys production would fall between  barrels and  barrels respectively until  the report states in terms of revenue they would be around   billion   billion less than in the first quarter the action discounted the results those most concerned with the current situation of the company are the shareholders they have had to see how stocks have fallen around  this year however the fall in profits production and income has already been discounted by the market and no major setbacks in the title would be seen for julian villamizar professor at the externado de colombia university the market has already discounted that the results will show a deterioration compared to previous quarters however the key points will be operating netback and operating cash flow generation the least likely scenario is that of a change to an uptrend for this to happen it must show a growing operating cash flow and an improvement in profitability margins says villamizar others like jose david lopez an economic analyst at asesoria e inversiones believe that the support for the action would be   technical   psychological and   if the results are lower

calculates its operating netbacks for revenues and costs based on its total sales volumes rather than volumes produced opinions julian villamizar professor at the externado de colombia university the

had already been seeing the results but it is possible that the asset continues in a downward trendthe  strategies for ecopetrol to recover its growth rate after announcing the negative results it had in the second quarter of the year ecopetrol has several challenges to raise its head and send an optimistic message to investors strengthening security in the oil infrastructure increasing production capacity and investing more in exploration are some of the five strategies that the oil company must implement strengthening security the issue of infrastructure is the most worrying for the sector since the pipelines have suffered  attacks so far this year this situation demands that the measures to protect the pipelines be strengthened and there are no more losses due to the spilled oil it is difficult to manage oil companies and make a profit if the country does not have sufficient security because companies go to the field and transport crude that ends up spilled on the road said fabio echeverri former president of the board of directors of ecopetrol the concern is not for less since the figures support the losses of the oil company according to the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta for every  average barrels per day per year bpbp that are stopped being produced that means   million as an impact on ecopetrols profits if one takes into account that in this first semester around  bpbp were not produced the situation is alarming if we multiply that by an average price of us   a barrel there is a very high loss that hits the finances and the results of any oil company added hernando barrero president of acipet however the task of increasing security will not be easy in fact the cano limoncovenas pipeline suffered a new attack last friday in the afternoon but the attack did not manage to pierce the pipe so there was no spill the government is already working to improve security with the provision of surveillance squads while it studies the use of drones to secure infrastructure from the air increase production another effort to be made by the oil company is to increase investments in commercial fields to increase production thus if an average price is maintained over us   per barrel the losses can be offset with additional income since the companys basket estimates a barrel at us   investing in exploration ecopetrol has made exploration efforts but the results have not been encouraging according to the report the oil company drilled four wells  in the second quarter but none were successful this is an important issue that must be carried out at the country policy level because it is necessary for companies to explore and be able to increase their reserves explained milton montoya director of research for the miningenergy department of the externado university it must be remembered that the level of oil in the ground today is  million barrels which lasts for  years so the explorations will increase the chances of extending that time and even if they do not guarantee it they will send a positive message to the market about the efforts that ecopetrol is making to produce crude for more years increase recovery another option that the company is already working on is improved recovery that is increasing the extraction of crude that is trapped in the ground because conventional technologies cannot extract it to achieve this the company has the improved recovery and steam laboratory of the colombian petroleum institute in which tests are carried out and then taken to the fields during the second quarter ecopetrol reported that it is advancing in four projects to increase the recovery i highlight the progress in secondary recovery pilots in the magdalena valley said javier gutierrez president of the oil company it also has on hand the star technology that pacific rubiales applied in the quifa field and that according to minister acosta its results are being analyzed sustaining foreign investment investments in other countries also support the operations of the oil company for example in the gulf of mexico a discovery was made in an area in which ecopetrol america has a  stake nexen petroleum

the market had already incorporated the figures since a few weeks ago the results of operations were released perhaps the only mole is the netback issue since it remains higher than that reported in  although it decreased compared to the first semester  for the remainder of the year the company is expected to maintain the good course that it has been leading up to now and with regard to its action the forecasts are positive since the exploration activity has resulted in a new discovery in the cubiro block in casanare and in the confirmation of the discoveries in canaguey  and rio ariari on the other hand the behavior of the markets in july was quite positive according to the colombian stock exchange bvc the fixed income business and the registry of fixed income and variable income shares

were outstanding fabian perdomo equity and securities equity analyst negotiations on the stock market increased in july and this is explained because the global effect and the holidays have passednegotiation between ecopetrol and unions ends without any agreement between the parties the president of the uso barrancabermeja pointed out that if ecopetrol continues to delay the negotiation and does not call them back to the table with another face the protest tasks including the strike would be deepened the ecopetrol negotiators have not been serious at the table we agreed on one thing one day and the next they discarded it and under those conditions the uso stands up from the table said coneo the organization noted that the four unions in the process uso adeco aspec and sindispetrol will continue with the steps established by law which could involve reaching an arbitration tribunal these terms will be key to the future of oil production which has had a difficult time this yearunions and ecopetrol have  days to find a solution and avoid the start of the labor strike at the oil company the deadline for ecopetrol and the unions to reach an agreement for the new collective agreement ended yesterday without an agreement between the organizations however the parties still have  working days to define labor policies before appearing before an arbitration tribunal or before the four linked unions choose to call a general strike the uso adeco aspec and sindispetrol are the four organizations that sat down with ecopetrol to present a series of requests that a source from the oil company described as absurd and unfeasible for the company among the requests the following stand out the increase in a special premium by  the extension of the travel limit between  and  or that the company once again be  stateowned which would imply repurchasing the shares for its part the uso led by edwin castano has indicated that ecopetrol has not had a real intention of reaching an agreement with the workers so they will advance in the process while they get ready for a strike among the issues they denounce is the level of hiring which is mostly through contractors now there will be  business days to define whether to go to court or strike but that will not depend only on the uso but on the other unions and ecopetrol said castano versions found the possible start of a strike at ecopetrol has challenged positions due to the legality of the strike while the uso maintains that it is preparing the start of a generalized strike to which the contractors would also join the oil company assures that the strike would again be declared illegal as it happened in  on the one hand the unions are backed by the organization labor international ilo to choose that path and protect workers rights ecopetrol for its part points out that the judgment of october   of the council of state already declared the strike of  promoted by the uso illegal because it did not comply with the law and started what they described as an unjustified strike during the process the ministry of social protection declared that at least seven points of the national constitution the substantive labor code and other decrees had been violated this situation could be repeated if the steps established by the code are not followed but the decision will be known in the coming days added to these versions are contradictions within the union although the deputy director of the organization in barrancabermeja pointed out that they had gotten up from the table castano denied the fact a few hours later illegal contracts the union sindical has denounced on several occasions the high level of outsourcing in the oil company of  people who are linked to the company  are employed under this modality in addition the uso also denounced yesterday a possible irregularity in some  ecopetrol contracts and asked the government to keep an eye on these connections faced with the case the oil company pointed out that if there is evidence it should be presented to the public but not to leave unsupported insinuations the contingency plan is ready if the two parties do not reach an agreement for the new collective labor agreement and the four unions comply with initiating a strike ecopetrol has a contingency plan ready that would allow it to continue with operations maintain the levels of crude oil production and meet the national demand for gasoline the company trusts in this strategy as it was the same one that was applied in  when the unions also went on strike that was declared illegal by the governmentecopetrol and unions reach an agreement and sign a new collective agreement the president of the uso edwin castano highlighted the agreements reached in political and labor matters which contemplate salary and educational improvements among others one of the achievements is the creation of a scenario made up of the ministries of labor mines and finance ecopetrol and uso where work will be done to seek labor formalization in the oil sector this because according to the union out of every  company workers less than two have direct hiring conditions with the company we do not renounce our legitimate search for these workers to one day have a direct contract with ecopetrol we have the firm conviction that the company is outsourcing jobs that are direct and missionary to the company said castano regarding salary an agreement was reached to increase the salary with the cpi plus  reaching  in addition an increase was set in the salary table of the workers where increases between  and  were achieved likewise another of the achievements is the expansion of the scholarships awarded by the company for workers and their families in the case of workers it was agreed to go from  to  scholarships for wives from  to  and for children from  to  the agreement also contained ecopetrols will to operate the rubiales field at starting in  as well as the intention to advance in the modernization of the barrancabermeja refinery similarly the pact established that ecopetrol will finance the second national assembly for peace where according to castano the national government the oil company and the uso will form a stage for dialogue so that its conclusions are taken to the tables of the peace process which is taking place in havana cuba the agreement was agreed with the uso and adeco however in the case of the sindispetrol and aspec unions a consensus was not reached so the process is expected to begin with an arbitration tribunal to settle the conflict between the parties the managers of the oil company will meet starting tomorrow with the union representatives where the parties will carry out a review process on everything agreed in these  days to adjust it to the text of the conventionaspec and sindispetrol the only ones that still have not reached a labor agreement with ecopetrol for their part the uso and adeco who also participated in the design of a new labor policy the process of which required  days of meetings and concluded on saturday night accepted what was negotiated in favor of better working conditions hector vaca leader of the union sindical obrera uso explained that the national union of workers of operating companies contractors subcontractors of petroleum industry activities sindispetrol and aspec which represents professionals in the sector preferred give priority to the rights to exercise their union activity such as permits and guarantees the situation among uso members the largest union with nearly  affiliated workers  direct and the rest contractors is totally different today they celebrate the agreements reached that contemplate improvements in wages education opportunities among others one of them establishes the creation of a commission in which the ministries of labor mines and finance as well as ecopetrol and the uso will participate with the aim of increasing labor formalization since according to the union of  people linked to the company  they are outsourced the president of the organization edwin castano said he would not give up that these workers come to have a direct contract because they are missionary positions of the company in this regard alvaro younes president of fedispetrol warned about the need for jobs in the sector not only to be well paid but to include all benefits however he assured that the unions must seek with their requests greater efficiency of the company and a better positioning regarding salaries an agreement was reached to increase payments to workers based on the cpi formula   in addition an increase in the remuneration table between  and  was set and modifications to the ladder ceiling were agreed after  years of service employees were stagnant and could not be promoted we want there to be more opportunities for both operators and administrators said vaca former deputy minister of mines manuel maiguashca questioned that a sector that has the best conditions in the country has demands of this level the unions want to monopolize work he said in this the former minister of mines luis ernesto mejia agreed for whom this is the best paying industry even for contractors but likewise it is the one with the greatest regulation so i do not believe that there is the level of informality expressed by companies since there must be a certain degree of coresponsibility with the fact that they are in the sights of the whole world but it cannot be denied that there is outsourcing according to mejia the oil sector demands a high degree of specialization so practically all activities are outsourced since it is impossible for a company to have all the knowledge that is required he said the uso also denounced a possible irregularity in  ecopetrol contracts and asked the government to keep an eye on these connections we made this situation known to the company and they agreed to make the respective reviews the attorney generals office will also investigate the case as it is noted that there is a duplication of functions  the text of the convention where the agreement is established and whose validity will be four years will be drawn up this week with the union representatives and the oil company in addition it will be adjusted again in  for their part sindispetrol and aspec must appear before the arbitration tribunal so that it defines the economic and labor conditions that will govern them from now on the results of more than  hours of negotiations the negotiation day began on friday august  at  noon and lasted until saturday night among the achievements are the granting of one more day of vacation bonus for each year worked preferably paid in money so as not to increase absences the extension of scholarships granted by the company for workers and their families for workers it was agreed to go from  to  scholarships for their wives from  to  and for their children from  to  and the holding of the second national assembly for peace in colombia edwin castano president of the union sindical obrera uso we have to direct our efforts to produce the  million barrels that we have proposed for  and to position the company in the first places in latin america javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol this agreement which we reached through dialogue and trust establishes labor relations and strengthens the company for the benefit of the workers the company and the regions where we operateecopetrol is putting out to tender to buy gasoline shipments for september ecopetrol acquired a gasoline shipment earlier this month and also offered to buy up to  shipments of ultralow sulfur diesel ulsd to be delivered between september and march for the current operation the company explained that it will receive offers until august  and these must refer to the prices of unleaded  gasoline on the us coast of the gulf of mexico the  barrels per day bpd cartagena refinery the second largest in colombia is under a major expansion program that began in march and most of its units will be paralyzed until the second quarter of ecopetrol prudence and imprudence it is necessary to celebrate that a labor agreement has been reached with the main unions of ecopetrol which made it possible to avoid a strike at the oil company that would have been disastrous at the present time the senseless attacks against the oil infrastructure that according to what was known amount to more than   billion the failure or in any case the very limited event that the round had to award new exploration areas the reluctance that several major oil companies have already shown to continue working in colombia the elusive goal of one million barrels that we have failed to achieve the fall in your share price the delay in making important new findings and finally the fierce competition that colombia will receive from mexico to attract foreign investment in hydrocarbons now that the aztec country has liberalized the rules on foreign investment in this sector ecopetrols fragile financial situation  and its action  depends a lot on its reserves it has not been able to increase them despite the efforts made to date cano limon was succeeded by cusiana but the replacement of this field that has already gone into decline has not yet appeared ecopetrol would have received a fatal blow with a strike at this time in addition to the negotiating parties who must of course be congratulated i think i guess in this arrangement the skillful hand of the new minister lucho garzon who was responsible for his debut as a mediator in this conflict between ecopetrol and its unions his statement was also fortunate that the initiative to reestablish overtime should be agreed with all sectors he spoke of a concerted minga so that offer would have been launched in the heat of the political campaign for the presidency i predict success for lucho garzon at the head of a portfolio as delicate and complex as that of trabajo his track record and disposition amply credit him for successfully handling this glassy front of labor relations which he knows as well as anyone these fortunate interventions by lucho garzon contrast with the hasty statements of the vice president related to ecopetrol according to analyst jose roberto acosta el espectadorcom august  the contradictory pronouncements of public officials also affect the market such as for example when the vice president announced in a radio interview the sale of another portion of the company on the stock market ecopetrol generating fears that ended up causing the price to fall  in two days equivalent to a loss in market capitalization of more than us   million  for much less a major scandal was created for petro when recently taken office he made misleading statements about the price of the bogota energy company that generated sharp drops in the stock market market hopefully as the new government takes hold the discretion of senior public officials will be accentuated so that prudence prevails over recklessness in such delicate matters pd what is the prosecutors office going to do with the hacker sepulvedas statements is it going to give them credibility if you do you will have to file many criminal charges because what the hacker confesses there is nothing more than a gigantic and shameless criminal association in which many people participatedthe oil company ecopetrol opens a call to contract  tank cars this capacity will allow the company to mobilize

david ballen analyst of strategies and investigations at casa de bolsa since last year the company had planned to sell in the second half of this year and the process continues to advance the first reaction is that the price of the asset to be sold tends to fall when trying to adjust to a possible sale price now comes the waiting of how the process conditions and price will be but it is

priceecopetrol will define the future of the rubiales field in the first half of  the first debate of the fifth commission on hydrocarbon issues was quite controversial because the future of the rubiales field was put on the table again which will be defined in the first half of  this was stated by the minister of mines and energy tomas gonzalez during his first session in the fifth commission of the senate after being summoned by senator jorge robledo to speak about operations in the field the member of the polo democratico asked gonzalez and the president of ecopetrol javier genaro gutierrez to leave the future of the area in the hands of the national oil company to do this he pointed out that the star technology tests that pacific was conducting to double production were a failure he also added that so far ecopetrol has not shown that they do not have the muscle to operate the area and expand its production so it would be necessary for another company to operate rubiales however the minister replied that this is not a decision that one can take lightly we have to see if the net present value is greater than the extension or not that is the beginning to make the decision he said for his part the president of ecopetrol assured that the company does have the capacity to operate the area but it will be necessary to analyze the factors mentioned by the minister to make a decision this option not only leaves the door open to pacific but to other companies that present an official offer to operate the field here the fundamental criterion that is going to be highlighted is that the value for colombia of making an extension with pacific or someone else is greater than the value if it is not done added the minister it should be noted that pacific has not presented this proposal although it has expressed its interest in continuing to collaborate with ecopetrol in the area through letters referred to by senator robledo while that issue is being defined the president of ecopetrol added that they will continue working on other technologies to increase recovery some of them in the company of pacific the importance of the field for ecopetrol it is key to define the best future for rubiales because every  that the recovery increases it will mean about  barrels that will give us enough resources to finance programs like familias en accion he said to this is added that the field could represent more than us   billion in reserves when it returns to ecopetrol according to the senators calculations gutierrez responded to this that the figure could be much higher but everything will depend on the production costs of each barrel and the investments that the company makes to extract the oil these figures demonstrate the importance of the government defining in the first half of next year the best operating plan for the countrys main field the discussion on star has not yet been closed although the star technology pilot tests stopped in the quifa field the discussion is not yet closed as both the government and the company continue to analyze the results of the practices that were applied in the area this test showed what are the applications of this technology the consequences the environmental impacts on this a technical evaluation is carried out that allows us to decide if more pilots are made or if the technology is discarded this discussion has not been completely closed said the minister of mines tomas gonzalezecopetrol will issue bonds abroad for more than us   million according to the president the expectation they have with the new issuance is quite positive and they hope to be able to issue the entire amount they have budgeted a few days ago through the financial superintendence of colombia the entity reported that as part of the procedures required to keep the debt alternatives in force to finance its investment plan it obtained from the ministry of finance and public credit through resolution  of august   authorization to manage the issuance and placement of bonds in the international market the approved sum that the state company has to issue papers is up to us   millionmax

vice president has also been linked to companies such as latin america bridas energy and astra capsa all in the energy sector javier genaro gutierrez president of the multinational spoke with lr about torres appointment and pointed out that the profile and experience of a person in the international market will help strengthen ecopetrols exploratory activities much more at a time when the company

in london that while the main focus will remain in colombia the company also plans to make an offer for fields in mexico which is opening its energy sector we see internationalization as an opportunity to diversify said manosalva who specified that they will focus on available land fields attacks by rebel groups against pipelines and oil facilities pushed ecopetrols production to an average of  barrels of crude per day at the end of the first half below the goal of  barrels per day for all of  the company is working with the colombian government to expedite the approvals of environmental exploration licenses that can take years to process ecopetrol invests approximately  of its capital expenditures in exploration manosalva said saying the figure is unlikely to change in the next few years the official abstained from revealing the amount the company plans to invest in  which this year amounts to us   million we have been investing most of the capital investments in exploration  but we have not had a major discovery he said without new gas discoveries in particular manosalva acknowledged that the company is going to have a supply problem of new demand in  ecopetrol also announced that its exports to india are increasing rapidly and that the modernization and expansion of its cartagena refinery will conclude on scheduleecopetrol will process permits to use the fracking technique in exploration fracking is a technology that is designed to be developed and applied properly and the government has been doing a responsible job there gutierrez told efe news agency this is a technique that makes it possible to increase the extraction of gas and oil from the subsoil and that has been the focus of controversy in the world it has even been prohibited in other countries in this regard the minister of mines and energy tomas gonzalez specified to the same agency that the technical and environmental regulation in the country establishes that environmental impact studies as well as the request for licenses for the exploration phase must be made using hydraulic fracturing technologybioenergys cost overruns and delays add to ecopetrols problems some of ecopetrols most important projects have several problems in common labor problems cost overruns and the restructuring of initial proposals the cartagena reficar and barrancabermeja refineries are an example of this situation to which is added the construction of the main ethanol plant in colombia developed by bioenergy a company in which ecopetrol has a  stake the initiative that began as a bet for the biofuels sector has had obstacles that multiplied the budget from us   million estimated in  to us   million calculated for this year colombia has good opportunities for ethanol thanks to free trade agreements with the united states and canada so it would be consistent for there to be a production capacity based on that says pedro carmona director of the hydrocarbons institute at the sergio arboleda university but the development of this project has not gone well when the engineering and construction work was awarded to spains isolux in june  it was said that execution would begin in  and that the plant would be ready in the first quarter of  with a capacity to produce some  liters of diesel despite this in september  the first budget increase was requested because the initial proposal was restructured the increase in the contract price was justified by changes in the configuration of the plant  it was increased by variation in the following components boiler capacity adaptation of safety standards investment in piling and foundations between other points bioenergy justified in its  report labor problems were added to the budget situation at the end of  more than  workers protested the lack of payment of wages and benefits isolux did not respond to the situation and instead bioenergy had to pay more than   million to employees to comply with agreements reached this year and that have been maintained to date says aleck santamaria de la cruz bioenergy manager these execution problems led to the project not being ready in  and much less at the beginning of this year when the ecopetrol subsidiary terminated the contract with the spanish company the consequence of the liquidation of the contract led to adding more execution time to the project and losing the guarantees of some of the equipment that had already been acquired says the manager to date it is estimated that due to all these problems the project already costs about us   million but will be expanded by another us   million for a total of us   million the bioenergy executive believes that there will be no further increases in costs because within the planning process they included conditions for the new contractor consorcio menegua that gives us the peace of mind of having toplevel companies in the construction and development of this type of project he adds with these new commitments santamaria de la cruz believes that the technical part of the project will be ready in the first half of  and will operate from the second half of that year jorge bendeck president of fedebiocombustibles explains that the delays do not suit the sector because the government has already set the goal of reaching a mixture of  ethanol in fuels for next year thanks to the operation of this plant and another in the riopaila sugar mill they would reach  in  this situation could be compared with that of reficar which began with a budget of us   billion and to date is estimated at more than us   million because the initial capacity was restructured there have also been work stoppages over protests against contractor cbi the situation in barrancabermeja is not very different because since  a modernization was announced that is still being structured javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol said that they are taking the time not to repeat the mistakes made at reficar for now the company hopes to solve this situation isolux will have to answer for increases while the company advances in the planting of the  hectares the bioenergy manager indicated that they have already requested an arbitration process before a court so that isolux responds for the effects of the contract delay which would include the an additional us   million that the project will cost this process could last more than a year but the manager trusts that they have all the arguments for the spanish to answer for the cost overruns that have been generated so far opinions pedro carmona director of the inst of hydrocarbons of sergio arboleda colombia has a good international market for ethanol because several of the ftas have opened up the sale of the product in countries such as the united states and canada jorge bendeck president of fedebiocombustibles the execution of the project and the plant at ingenio riopaila will help us meet the goal for  that  of

broke the support of   it is a worrying issue because it is the most representative action of colcap but it is aligned with what has been the generalized behavior of all species  says andres rosas equity analyst at global securities adding that part of the effect of the fall in the stock market would be related to the expectations of the agents in international markets and the negative effects as well as the slowdown in the chinese and european economies these external pressures that are being exerted have an effect in colombia  likewise foreigners who have been the main buyers during september became net sellers of shares in the local market this behavior at the end of last month could be extending to the beginning of october another aspect is that the international monetary fund

argentine firm pluspetrol and its partners in peru launched an auction to sell three shipments of  barrels of natural gasoline to be delivered to the port of pisco during november according to a

new york harborecopetrol sells one million barrels of crude to a south korean refinery the sale will be dispatched on friday october  said ecopetrol which did not provide details on the value of the transaction ecopetrol continues to consolidate its participation in the asian market since since  it has been selling the crude it produces in its fields to countries such as china and india while shipments to the united states have decreased the oil company said in a statement hyundai oilbank co has a  barreladay refinery capable of processing heavy crude from its refinery in daesan hyundai produces and distributes petroleum and petrochemical and industrial products in the local market ecopetrol said that the south korean firm raised the interest of maintaining the purchase directly and increasing the volume of colombian crude for its refinery in the future the colombian oil company sent  of its exports to the asian market in the first half ecopetrol contributes more than  of colombian oil productionecopetrol makes its way into the south korean market ecopetrol achieved the first sale of heavy crude from castilla for one million barrels to south korea in development of the strategy to diversify the destinations of its exports the business with hyundai oilbank opens the doors of the korean market that every day demands more heavy crude pedro carmona director of the institute of hydrocarbons of the sergio arboleda university considers that this is positive news looking towards the future since the diversification of markets will allow to replace exports to the united states a country that is increasingly selfsufficient in its production  ecopetrol said that the south korean firm raised the interest of maintaining the purchase directly and increasing the volume of colombian crude for its refinery in the future for the colombian oil company this type of business generates great benefits initially because brent oil is priced above the wti this also reflects the importance of the asian market for ecopetrol to which the company has exported  of its total shipments abroad additionally alejandro reyes director of investigations at ultraburstiles believes that it is a fundamental step since precisely this year was the first in  that the us manages to have a surplus in its production to sustain its local demand and it manages to export since this is our main trading partner in crude oil it is necessary for colombia to start looking for markets that are deficient in terms of crude oil in order to establish itself as a supplier in them  among the asian countries that have done business with colombia for more than two years are india and china reyes affirms that we must be careful with negative scenarios since despite the price being slightly more favorable in terms of brent transportation costs are higher which is why it is a business that requires greater efficiencies from ecopetrol hyundai oilbank has a  barreladay refinery capable of processing heavy crude from its refinery in daesan hyundai produces and distributes petroleum and petrochemical and industrial products in the local market opinions alejandro reyes director of economic research at ultraburstiles the fact that the asian market now has heavy crude refineries for business with venezuela has suited colombia due to its good levels of crude oil production of this typeecopetrol exxonmobil and parex resources the oil companies that will develop fracking the future of fracking or hydraulic stimulation is in the hands of three worldclass oil companies ecopetrol exxonmobil and parex resources will take the first steps with the technology that has caused controversy at a time when the sector requires efforts to guarantee the countrys selfsufficiency the companies managed to keep the areas that have potential in unconventional reservoirs ync through assignments from the national hydrocarbons agency anh five blocks were delivered in the  colombia round three to ecopetrol and two more to a temporary union between the colombian company and exxonmobil see graph the sixth block in the magdalena medio valley santander was awarded to canadian parex resources in the  colombia round that the anh did in july according to agency records it was the only ync zone assigned by the government despite initial optimism for the future of these deposits as the six areas are prospecting for ync the technology that the sector has studied for drilling is fracking an activity that the government valued for two years and that in  finalized its regulatory framework the government has taken its time to learn about fracking and publish the regulations so the conditions are in place for companies to move forward explained milton montoya director of research at the externado universitys mining and energy department despite that javier betancourt president of the anh pointed out that the regulations are very new so companies are going to take time to study them the calculations of the sector according to the calculations of the colombian petroleum association acp in the next four years some  exploratory wells will be drilled which will open the possibility of the country to triple the crude oil reserves in the next  years today they give for just over  years but the anhs calculations are different being realistic i dont think the first drilling will be done before the end of  or the beginning of  and the results could be seen between eight and ten years but everything will depend on each deposit said nicolas mejia vice president of promotion and allocation of areas of the agency in any case this is a key moment for companies to move forward with fracking anh does not foresee a new round in  the national hydrocarbons agency and the ministry of mines and energy have in sight an objective for the hydrocarbon sector to strengthen the regionalization of the projects that have been assigned but that have not been able to move forward  due to licensing issues or inconveniences with the communities that objective leads them to rule out for the moment a new colombia round in the coming years so these three companies ecopetrol exxonmobil and parex are the ones that will define the future of fracking in the coming years since its creation the anh has attracted around us   million through contracts until   us   million but about  is yet to be executed for this reason at this time no round is planned in the short term neither in  nor in  and this has been stated by the anh and the ministry in some forums  explained nicolas mejia vice president of assignment and promotion of the agency opinions javier betancourt president of the anh we still do not know of companies that have started the licensing process the rule is new so i think they are going to take their time  milton montoya research director u externado mining and energy depot the moment is very delicate because seven years in terms of energy consumption is very short it is urgent that new deposits be found ecopetrol and repsol confirm the discovery of crude oil in the gulf of mexico  a net oil warehouse net pay has been found more than  meters thick within a column of more than  meters said the spanish oil company according to a reuters report the leon well  kilometers off the louisiana coast was one of the most promising in ecopetrols international explorationecopetrol has a new well in the gulf of mexico the colombian oil company ecopetrol in company with the spanish repsol will participate in the oil well discovered in the gulf of mexico exactly  kilometers off the coast of the united states the national firm has a  stake in this asset which is characterized by being a net warehouse of oil cataloged as good quality more than  meters thick according to repsol in a statement the finding came after the well was drilled under a  meter sheet of water helping total drilling to reach a total of  meters this is one of the deepest wells that the spanish company works which in this area which has been classified as one of the most profitable areas due to its exploration potential in deep waterin this area repsol has  blocks for continue to gather efforts in search of oil in addition to having participation in the shenzi field with  wells in production connected through two platforms with this finding the united states now represents about  of repsols total hydrocarbon sector production additionally he owns rights to places such as green canyon alaminos canyon and garden banks the discovery occurred in the framework of the celebration of  years at the head of the company of antonio brafau who became president in  when the barrel of brent oil was trading in the order of   now with a price of around us   the manager has the mission of continuing to grow in the north american market where yesterdays discovery was made while still looking at other fronts such as the canary islands where repsol also has a stake with the same objective of regaining presence in the market and gaining financial muscle the manager announced that the company has more than us   million to acquire assets in a company in the sector in oecd countries for now ecopetrol hopes to take advantage of the discovery made in the united states the national firm has a  stake in this asset which is characterized by being a net

canary islands where repsol also has a stake in addition under the same objective of regaining presence in the market and gaining financial muscle the manager announced that the company has more than us   million to acquire assets in a company in the sector in oecd countries for now ecopetrol hopes to take advantage of the discovery made in the united statesoil would affect ecopetrols profits by more than  the constant fall in international oil prices will pass a collection account to the profits of the countrys main oil company ecopetrol according to market analysts the drop is expected to be over  in the third quarter of this year that estimate would be close to the range for the decline in wti which has fallen  in the last three months and brent which has fallen  if it is taken into account that the average price of the crude oil basket has fallen by us   and that ecopetrols production is about  barrels of oil per day on average what has been stopped receiving from sales amounts to us   million   trillion to this we must add that about  of colombias production is heavy crude which is paid us   below market values with these prices the projects that are under development and the entire future of the country for heavy crude lose profitability said julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines and energy however the oil company could have two reliefs for the period the devaluation and the reduction of attacks first a more expensive dollar will mean more income for the company from its exports and compensation for the fall in the dollar price although it cannot be forgotten that external debts will be more expensive once they are transferred to the local market the second factor involves the recovery of oil production which normalized at more than  bpdp and the lower costs that the company had to assume to repair the infrastructure said diego usme an equity analyst at ultraburstiles with these two factors revenues are going to fall  which translates to   million optimism due to slight recovery in prices the price situation has improved slightly in the last week which generates a bit of optimism in the market after having touched a floor of us   for the wti the barrel is already trading above us   while the brent went from us   to more than us   yesterday although the margin has been between two and three dollars it is worth remembering that according to the governments calculations each dollar translates into about   million in oil income an increase in company income and the payment of royalties despite this prices are still well below the average of around us   for wti and us   for brent which is a concern for the profitability of the business and longterm investmentsdo not make a black party with ecopetrol data we cannot lynch ecopetrol because of the external situation of oil prices much less because of the fall in the share in the secondary market two situations that are somehow closely linked the quarterly profits of the company about   billion are expected today with great expectation by the ministry of finance and by the brokers of the colombian stock exchange since the message that is sent with that figure is crucial for the auction of the year the stateowned mixed oil company is the backbone of the colombian economy and is by far one of the companies that hires the most in several remote regions of the country the political bullying against their adverse situation can be worse than the current situation itself more than half a million people both natural and legal have shares in the oil company value papers that they once acquired for   and that today are not worth more than   that loss of value in stocks has savers and investors nervous about the quarterly profits that are registered today the bets speak that they will be around   billion in a market used to receiving good news but the local and international situation have not helped that trend of bonanza to continue the public order situation is not good and the exploration and oil extraction tasks have been very complicated this year to this reality is added the world environment of very low prices both in the brent barrel at us   and in the wti at us   for every dollar that a barrel falls the state coffers stop receiving about   million annually which is a situation that has made the bank of the republic nervous which at its meeting yesterday made its concern known the good news is that the dollar continues to trade higher and the exchange rate is playing in favor of the decreased crude oil exports by price a dollar above   helps a lot to ecopetrols figures as well as the decision made by the ministry of mines in the sense of stabilizing or increasing the price of a gallon of gasoline and acpm that will be taken tonight  the millionaire gasoline subsidy that is borne by the mixed state company can also play an important role in this situation and the analysis allows us to say that the government does not have it easy with the decision of fuel prices for november that at first glance they should lower local costs through low oil prices in the international market but we cannot lose sight of the weight of the dollars surge which will ultimately balance the decisiontaxes and crude oil prices pass a collection account to ecopetrols results the increase in the payment of taxes the constant fall in international oil prices and the devaluation of the peso will pass a collection account to the main oil company in the country ecopetrol the company will present its third quarter financial results today and analysts expect the companys profits to fall by about   trillion bringing it to a profit of   trillion with that range the company would give a strong setback to the  figures because in september of that year its profit reached close to   trillion when the oil company produced about  average daily barrels of oil and the dollar was not above    said diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles the previous tax reform hit all the companies in the sector very hard because it took a toll on those capitalintensive activities added former minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta that is why the unions have asked the government that the new reform does not tax nonproductive assets such as investments in exploration since companies do not have returns for their activity another key factor will be the lower income from production as a result of scheduled maintenance or terrorist attacks it is estimated that for every  barrels   million a year is lost acosta recalled regarding the price of the dollar the company faces two scenarios higher income from exports that increase with the local currency but higher price on debt that has been acquired in dollars according to the companys figures the debts issued in bonds in the united states amount to us   billion which will be more expensive with the current level of the dollar imports another key factor in thirdquarter revenue is imports on account of the fuels that the company has purchased to meet local demand and which it has paid at international prices since operations at the cartagena refinery reficar have been stopped  more indebtedness is expected ecopetrols results add to the market and government concern about the reduction in oil income due to the drop in crude oil prices in the international market which is why the executive has already opened the door to greater indebtedness if the reduction is maintained the board of directors of the banco de la republica has expressed its concern for the last few months about the reduction in prices and in its last statement reiterated that they are below the forecast of the technical team and says that this has implied a deterioration in the terms of exchange rate of the country despite the fact that the international prices of coffee remain high and the prices of other basic goods  if the fall in the terms of trade continues it will negatively affect the growth of national income  the minister of finance mauricio cardenas indicated that there is no concern for next year and there are no risks to the general budget of the nation pgn approved for   billion since it was based on the longterm price he stated that if the price falls you do not have to revise the budget downward nor do you have to tighten the economy  you can borrow a little more the issuers manager jose dario uribe said that although the fall has fiscal impacts this will not affect a major modification to the growth projections for next year which are between  and  low ranges worry the market although the international price of oil recovered slightly in the last week they remain in low ranges that continue to worry the market in fact some analysts believe that they will not return to the previous levels about us   for wti and us   for brent during the trading session yesterday the situation was no different a barrel of wti crude traded at us   stable compared to wednesdays close and the brent unit traded at us   that is   less than the previous day although the figures are low they still remain in a profitable range for companies which calculate the minimum between us   and us   according to their financial capacity from that point on the oil companies will have to review their investment plans opinions amylkar acosta former minister of mines and energy the previous tax reform hit all the companies in the sector very hard because it was an initiative that took the hand of those capitalintensive activities diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles with that figure ecopetrol would once again have profits as in september  when it reached   trillion but we hope there will be relief from other costs  mauricio cardenas minister of finance if the price falls you dont have to lower the budget nor do you have to tighten the economy  you can borrow a little moreecopetrols net profits fell  with this decrease profits in the period julyseptember  reached   billion while in the last nine months it was   billion compared to   billion registered in the same period of  this meant a  drop in contrast the companys production increased  compared to the second quarter of the year reaching  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped as a result of fewer attacks in the three months  news in development ecopetrol still has not overcome its bad hour despite the efforts made by the government the governments efforts to protect the oil infrastructure and ecopetrols achievements in increasing its production have not been enough to overcome the bad streak that the company has had this year once again its profits were down which increases the concern of the government and the financial sector because of what the state will stop receiving this year and the impact on the pockets of more than  shareholders and it is not for less because the annual fall in net profits was  while those of the third quarter of last year reached   billion those of the julyseptember  period were   billion according to the companys arguments the fall in international oil prices and the devaluation of the peso affected revenues our profit was lower due to the impact of the lower sale prices of crude oil products and gas which fell   and  respectively compared to the second quarter of this year he said javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol with this revenue as lr had anticipated the company returned to  levels when its profits were   trillion on average per quarter however it should be remembered that production was about  barrels per day and the dollar was not above   which translates into higher income from exports government measures although the market had anticipated this fall what is really worrying is ecopetrols bad timing since its operations were also affected in the first half of the year by the attacks the then minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta and the minister of defense juan carlos pinzon announced a shock plan to protect the pipelines and stop the fall in production that cost the country close to   billion the measure was successful as ecopetrols production grew  and reached  average barrels equivalent per day bepd however the recovery was not enough to offset the drop in international prices what are the options the way to face the fall in international prices is to increase oil production in this way it will be possible to offset the income from royalties oil rent and payment of taxes that per year amount to more than   billion in fact the minister of finance mauricio cardenas yesterday asked the oil company to increase its production to continue supporting social programs since it is the main source to finance projects such as familias en accion or social housing however companies will be able to produce until their profitability margin allows them between us   and us   per barrel should shareholders be alarmed the great concern regarding the drop in ecopetrols profits is the effect it will have on the dividends that will be paid to the companys more than  shareholders and it is not for less because the companys stock continues to decline in yesterdays session it closed at   which meant a  drop compared to thursdays session fabian perdomo stock and securities analyst pointed out that due to this trend the company is going to drop in the colcap list from first to third place surpassed by grupo sura and bancolombia and the situation is expected to continue to worsen in the fourth quarter of the year as the price of oil remains down it is very worrying because these are the results of months in which the price of oil was still above us   if you take into account that in the last month it has been even lower and that today yesterday it was below us   again then the income in the coming months will be even lower  explained julio cesar vera  former director of hydrocarbons of the ministry of mines and energy budget for  less than two months before ecopetrol presents its investment plan for next year it is already expected that the company will have to cut the  figure because this years profits will be lower than those of  the company will have to organize its priorities define which are the projects that are really making profits and the fields that have an important activity because ecopetrol has a number of small fields that do not generate a real profit he added vera and it is worth mentioning that the case of ecopetrol extends to the national scene since of the  producing fields that the country has more than  of the production is concentrated in  fields among which rubiales castilla and quifa stand out among others the double track of the dollar the devaluation of the peso will have a double effect on the companys figures one that will be positive in time derived from the fact that our operating income is mainly in dollars while many of our expenses are denominated in local currency  explained gutierrez the other effect will be negative because the level of indebtedness in dollars which amounts to some us   billion will be more expensive all these factors have ecopetrol at a crossroads a company that transferred   billion to the state in  and that in the coming months will have to redefine its course for  and it will have to do so with increasingly negative perspectives because market experts like goldman sachs they do not foresee a recovery in international oil prices the new tax reform worries about more taxes the tax reform that the government is proposing could be another blow to ecopetrol in the medium term this initiative which has not yet been discussed in congress seeks to further tax profits with the increase in the rate of the tax for equity it is also intended to continue with the  and with the wealth tax the taxes have hit the profits of the oil company in the first quarter it had an  increase in this regard third quarter results show that operating expenses increased  in part due to higher tax expenses   million the opinions julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons of the ministry of mines it is very worrying because these are the results of months in which the price of oil was still above us   javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol the results of the quarter were visibly affected by the international situation that caused a drop in crude export prices of us   per barrel amylkar acosta former minister of mines and energy the devaluation which is about  could cushion the fall in international prices and help ecopetrols resultsecopetrol sura and fabricato the moles of the results while most of the companies grow hand in hand with the good economic moment of the country some moles appear before the positive outlook of the companies that reported their accumulated results as of september of this year ecopetrol sura and fabricato showed negative variations for the most important oil company in the country ecopetrol the third semester of the year shows a lower net profit of  compared to the previous quarter mainly caused by external variables the results of the quarter were visibly affected by the international situation that caused a drop in crude export prices of us   per barrel during the quarter compared to the previous quarter as well as by the weakening of currencies of emerging countries he said javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol sa the depreciation of the exchange rate had two effects within the company and its financial statements one of them negative as it is related to debt in dollars and another positive effect due to having operating income mainly in dollars while many of the operating expenses recorded are made in local currency on the other hand grupo de inversiones suramericana reported last thursday that its accumulated income as of september was   million  less than the previous year given this inconvenience the positive aspect is highlighted in terms of assets that reached   trillion  more compared to december  additionally on september  the company reached a value of   per share the most high that this group has registered in its history the new historical maximum reached in the companys equity represents the solidity of the organization and the generation of value for its shareholders said david bojanini president of grupo sura the other mole on the list is fabricato since its negative variation was   million that is  less than the previous period to which was added another adverse figure for the organization for ebitda of   million a figure substantially lower than that of  with   million although the accumulated imported fabric income as of july grew  compared to  on the demand side clothing customers decreased their purchases due to lack of labor and maquila workshops in addition to the lower volume of sales to the public  explained carlos alberto de jesus president of fabricato despite these dissonances the other companies presented positive results among them are coltejer isa grupo exito construciones el condor enka procafecol and many others in the case of coltejer they closed the third quarter of the year with an increase in sales volumes of   million a figure that stands out due to the bad weather experienced by the importation of fabrics these operating results continue to encourage us to achieve the second step of recovery of the business and that is that the operation reaches to cover the level of financial expenses of the business lina posada jaramillo legal secretary of the company isa which also enjoys good results has a net profit of   million an increase of  compared to the same period in  the firm that operates the juan valdez brand recorded a turnover of   million in the first nine months of year a sum greater by   million approximately than the   million registered in the same period of  this growing trend has been maintained in recent years which ratifies the successful commercial strategy of the company said the firm in a statement finally grupo exito obtained operating income of over   trillion in addition to a  growth in net income and  in operating income as of september one of the reasons for the increase is the integration with super inter a strategic retail in the food market of the coffee region and valle del cauca that helps in the continuous work of strengthening the company and opening horizons coltejer will invest   million the coltejer textile company advances the investment plan that includes the purchase of modern machinery with financing from national and foreign banks for an amount between   and   million in its modernization the companys legal secretary lina posada jaramillo said that the company will maintain its cost reduction plan while trying to increase its business in the domestic market and continue with the opening of new points of sale of clothing and products of the company home line in bogota and rionegro by naming some of the proposed goals we continue to innovate in products and trends with a lot of commitment he said the opinions carlos alberto de jesus president of fabricato clients of clothing manufacturers decreased their purchases due to lack of labor and workshops for maquila in addition to the lower volume of sales javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol the results of the quarter were visibly affected by the international situation that caused a drop in crude export pricesecopetrol pacific rubiales and canacol produce clean barrels the term clean barrel is understood as the production of oil without accidents without environmental incidents and in harmony with stakeholders according to ecopetrol the dream of this colombian oil company is to be the most recognized company for producing barrels that help social economic and environmental development the social responsibility strategy is based on this concept in august ecopetrol reached a record  barrels of oil per day in the chichimene field in meta the company said that it expects to achieve an average production of  clean barrels per day in this field by the end of  and that by  they should maintain the growth rate under this model the production is seen as one of the oil companies social responsibility campaigns among other of their social and environmental retribution actions pacific and ecopetrol have led social projects with women heads of households children and high school graduates these strategies are intended to generate trust in its seven stakeholders which are customers employees partners communities the government investors and family members in order to ensure that these social responsibility strategies and specifically that of producing clean barrels are effective the monitoring and control of actions is essential in this way interest groups will be satisfied and any accident that may be generated will be avoided with these strategies oil companies seek to meet their commitments and objectives to make their business profitable and maintain their commitments with their stakeholdersecopetrol dividends would fall as much as  next year due to the price of crude these last few months have not been the best for ecopetrol terrorist attacks volatility in the markets external situations that affected the stock markets and in recent weeks the fall in the price of crude oil have been the triggers for the action of the oil company has had a devaluation of  in the last year likewise its financial results for the third quarter were not the best the annual fall in net profits was  while those of the third quarter of last year reached   billion those of the julyseptember  period were of   billion this has created uncertainty among investors regarding the payment of the dividend for  which according to analysts will be reduced in the worst case to  due to the bad streak that the company has had according to jose david lopez head of economic analysis at asesoria e inversiones this year the outlook has not been favorable for ecopetrol the first semester was affected by public order and attacks on the oil pipelines the company is showing financial results below the dividend estimates however it must be taken into account that ecopetrol is one of the companies in the world that continues to pay a very important dividend compared to the rest of the issuers  according to experts for next year it is estimated that the ordinary dividend that the oil company will pay to its shareholders will be close to   per share which with the extraordinary would range between   and   for  the oil company paid   for the ordinary dividend and   for the extraordinary dividend for a total of   per share which represented  of the companys profits the highest since  while the dividend payment more low was in  with   per share and  of total earnings the companys results were below those estimated by both bancolombia and the market consensus due to a combination of international oil prices and welldocumented struggles with local production and like any company declining income will affect dividends however without having the final results for  still available it is impossible to make an exact calculation of the impact says rupert stebbings vice president of equities at grupo bancolombia stebbings adds that in terms of dividends they are directly affected by net income which so far is  lower in the current year but this may not be directly correlated since it depends on the vote in assembly on distribution of profits as much as on those profits to be distributed analysts agree that ecopetrol has had a very difficult year due to the temporary problems that have arisen throughout the year and that at this point require turning the tide of opinion both with the public and with analysts the easiest way to do this is through oil discoveries however exploration is by definition a complicated business says grupo bancolombias vice president of equities the other factor that would help is a combination of price increases and fewer supply points that is fewer attacks on pipelines but those are difficult issues for the market to control the recommendation that the experts give at this time is to keep the action as there is a lot of uncertainty in the global oil space and it is preferable to see more transparency in terms of the global economy to be more confident with the future price of the security the fourth quarter is going to be tougher in terms of crude oil prices and additionally the pressure that will be generated with the fed meeting says diego usme equity analyst at ultraburstiles for now investors do not have to be alarmed but have patience with the market oil price uncertainty does not pass the price of oil remains under pressure due to a combination of economic factors such as growth in china and broader market issues such as oversupply meanwhile international analysts at the moment are reluctant to make definitive bets on where it will be in  months and that causes more tension the opinions rupert stebbings vice president equities grupo bancolombia the recommendation at this point is to keep the action there is a lot of uncertainty in the global oil space and we prefer to be more confident jose david lopez head of economic analysis of consultancies and investments in the short term the outlook for the oil sector is not so positive in the long term it is expected that the company will tend to regain its upward trend pacific proposes to ecopetrol a new contract at the rubiales field that goes beyond  recently the president of the company jose francisco arata said in an interview with lr that in recent years he has been working to replace the production of the field whose operation at the hands of the canadian company started in  like all oil assets and mature fields we knew that the reserves are not infinite and that they are going to be depleted therefore we have been developing new fields so that by the time it ends the contract we can replace production arata had said according to the oil company the rubiales field represents a smaller percentage of the companys production contributing  to net production in the third quarter of  decreasing from  and  in the same period of  and   respectively however it is important to note that the fields production was impacted this year by the limited water disposal capacity  but pacific expects to increase capacity once final approvals are received to start the operation of the agrocascada project which will allow for a greater amount of water and will mean an increase in total field production of approximately  bbl  d expense expectations cut pacifics new announcement comes at a time when international oil prices are falling against this background the company turns it over and plays for the field it also does so within the framework of the presentation of the third quarter results according to pacific it lowered its expectations of capital expenditures in exploration and production for the year from us   billion to us   billion in order to compensate for production that is in the lower

companies that did not have good luck during the third quarter is ecopetrol which registered a decrease of  in its net profit going from   billion to   billion in september what has affected this

economic factors such as growth in china and wider market issues such as oversupply international analysts are very reluctant to make definitive bets on where it will be in  months and that alone

is no need to fear because ecopetrol is a solid company and that these price drops are normal as well as when the price skyrockets due to external factors let us remember that this is an industry where these cycles occur and we must be prepared to face them clearly a company like ecopetrol and as other companies do as it enters to review their investment plans in terms of their costs and in

as well as when the price skyrockets due to external factors let us remember that this is an industry where these cycles occur and we must be prepared to face them clearly ecopetrol is going to review its investment plans  said the managerfour ways for ecopetrol to assume a lower investment plan in  with less than a month for the countrys main oil company to present its investment plan for next year some of the options that ecopetrol is studying to assume a lowest budget in  and that according to lr will not exceed us   billion due to the effects of the fall in the price of crude oil attacks and devaluation the fall compared to this year would be higher than  since for  a budget of us   million was executed among the alternatives of the oil company for this new period is the cut of dividends since in the last three years ordinary and extraordinary distributions have been made the latter surely can disappear because there are no longer high prices as in past years company spokesmen said on this point it must be remembered that international oil prices have fallen about  in four months which also led to the fall  of the oil companys profits in the third quarter ecopetrol should leave only an ordinary dividend due to the current situation in december there will be more clarity about the interests of the shareholders and the nation regarding this distribution said julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines and energy lowering the distribution of profits another of the companys alternatives is to reduce the profit margin that is distributed which in  reached  the repression of the utilities can be good to execute the investment plans but that will not be an easy decision due to the income that goes to the state what is expected is a cut in the payment of the dividend due to the fall in profits this year  explained alejandra mendez an analyst at serfinco prioritize projects with a lower budget ecopetrol will also define which projects will make a profit in the short term and would postpone other initiatives deciding to lower the budget is a responsible decision and in accordance with the outlook and projections of the international market because a speedy recovery is not expected said hernando barrero president of acipet among the projects that can be postponed is the expansion of the barrancabermeja refinery a project that will only give results until  according to ecopetrols calculations reduce indebtedness ecopetrols indebtedness which exceeds us   million is another headache for the company especially at a time when the dollar is over   because the debt becomes more expensive to compensate for this the oil company has already announced the sale of its participation in eeb and isa to raise more resources and not have to increase the debt to finance the  budget strategy to  another issue that ecopetrols board of directors is studying is the new strategy for  which will allow you to define your longterm goals and how to achieve them the company already has a plan in place for  but the outlook is expected to broaden and the new plan will be presented in the first quarter of  although the decisions will not be easy the market expects that sooner or later there will be clarity on those matters opinions hernando barrero president of acipet lowering the budget is a responsible decision in accordance with the outlook and projections of the international oil market julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at minminas the company should only maintain the ordinary dividend and review projects such as barrancabermeja to order its investmentscampetrol opposes a reduction in ecopetrols investment plan according to lizarralde through a budget cut in the company not only would it be sending a negative signal to foreign investors but it would be affecting the results of the activity in the long term any decision of this type must be analyzed with the greatest care and precision we must bear in mind the structure of an industry such as the oil industry where many of its results are longterm so what you do not do today or do not invest will have a strong consequence within five or seven years said lizarralde meanwhile the union manager said that he must analyze which ones ecopetrol wants to give importance to since those that deliver longterm results cannot be put at risk you have to keep in mind the structure of an industry like the oil industry where many of the investments are reflected in the long term for example if i do not invest in seismic or drilling i will not have results in seven years that is to reduce these activities is to condemn the country to a weakening of oil production  explained the president of campetrol faced with the strategy to  that ecopetrol has the president of campetrol indicated that each decision made must be based on the long term everything that is done in the investment plan must bear in mind the structure of the industry and the future projection today we have low prices but that does not mean that they will remain that way in seven years said lizarralde montoyapacific will ask ecopetrol to study the rubiales proposal again the executive asked that a response be taken in a relatively short time to avoid a divestment in the field news in developmentpacific will ask ecopetrol to study the rubiales proposal again we have long expressed our intention to continue operating campo rubiales what we have said is that again we are going to ask you to study the proposal and give us an answer said restrepo the executive asked that a response be taken quickly to avoid a divestment in the field if you do not have an answer in a relatively short time the field will suffer a divestment of us as partners and it will begin to suffer we need to define what the decision is regarding continuity he said it should be remembered that currently campo rubiales has an average production of  thousand barrels of oil per day so it is undoubtedly a strategic field for the production of crude oil in the country furthermore according to restrepo more than  of what the rubiales field the quifa field and all of the fields in which we are operating are generated remain in the nation restrepo referred to the star technology and said that this is one of the secondary recovery technologies that can be implemented in a field like rubiales what we have said is that this is the technology with which we have been participating which it has had successful pilot projects and we want to continue working on it but in addition to it we can implement any other secondary recovery technology  he assured meanwhile the uten hidrocarburos union asked that the proposal to renew the operating contract for pacific be studied because we know that the best thing for the country is that those who operate and know how to operate the field continue to do so the oil fields are very complex and a change in the operation will have an adverse impact on production assured the president of the union alejandro ospina in  days pacific would have the  budget ready the corporate vice president assured that at this moment the company is working on the preparation of the  budget and in about  days it would be ready to present it to the board of directors based on the international price variables it should be remembered that during  the company prepared its budget based on crude oil at us   per barrel but with the recent drop in the price of a barrel at the international level the department of commerce and supply is working on adjusting that price for the next year that would be more conservative we are all attentive to what is discussed in opec if saudi arabia gives in to the pressure of the other members of the organization to lower production the price would rise a little and that would allow us to adjust our price the executive saidecopetrol climbed seven places among the  largest oil companies the largest company in the country ecopetrol was once again among the  largest oil companies in the world in position  this year rising seven places compared to last years ranking when it was ranked  the count carried out by the consultancy energy intelligence also shows that ecopetrol is the fourth largest oil company in latin america preceded by pdvsa of venezuela the only one in the top  occupying the fifth position petrobras of brazil and pemex of mexico which occupy places  and  respectively it should be noted that for the first time petrobras moved above pemex ypf of argentina appears in position number  while petroecuador and ypfb are among the next  positions the ranking is led by saudi aramco from saudi arabia nioc from iran china cnpc and exxon mobil of the united states it is followed by pdvsa shell bp gazprom rosneft and chevron companies are ranked annually according to performance on six operational metrics oil and gas reserves production product sales and refinery distillation capacity the  largest companies in the top  represent a significant part of the worlds oil operations with about  of the worlds crude production and about half of its oil reserves additionally in this top  almost  of the top  companies are based on or focused on the americas compared to  just five years ago the report highlights that latin american oil companies advanced in the ranking largely led by ecopetrol in addition the report highlights ypf which entered the top  for the first time in  years and has a great opportunity to win with the argentine shale the reforms in the mexican energy sector were also highlighted by energy intelligence which reported that these could generate competition for investment in the coming years which could limit operating growth in certain countriesecopetrol stock plummets  reaching   jose david lopez economic analyst at asesoria e inversiones affirmed that ecopetrol has been hitting minimums since february  this drop is due clearly to current oil prices since the wti is currently losing  and is trading at us   which means that this is the lowest level since may   when it was trading around us   he explained it should be noted that the wti has lost  so far this year and ecopetrols papers so far this year have lost  the correlation between oil prices is direct as long as oil does not recover ecopetrols share will not do so either the next meeting of the opep could be in february  but it is not confirmed yet said lopez experts agree that there is no need to panic and affirm that the ideal is not to start liquidating positions since the hydrocarbon economic outlook is not the most favorable worldwide this sector is governed a lot by or political decisions between countries we can have an announcement before february to help stimulate it he addedecopetrol pacific rubiales and canacol energy have a bitter taste due to the fall of black gold the decision taken at the meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to keep its production ceiling unchanged and the low price of a barrel of oil are the main triggers for the collapse of oil stocks listed on the stock exchange colombian securities bvc according to experts the economic outlook for hydrocarbons is negative not only in colombia but also in the world so they advise not to panic and state that the ideal is not to start liquidating positions this drop is mainly due to current oil prices as the wti hit minimums since may   when it was trading around us   says jose david lopez economic analyst at asesorias e inversiones for his part andres duarte economic analyst at corficolombiana considers that here the issue is supply and since the opec meeting it was decided that there will not be a reduction in supply then oil prices will not go up in the case of ecopetrol according to the experts it is important to act with caution and they ask to take into account that the fundamental value of the company must adjust to the new oil price scenarios the results of the fourth quarter are going to have a negative impact due to the price of oil the value of crude oil fell  and ecopetrol has definitely been correlated with the movement of oil  explains edgar romero equity analyst at corredores asociados at the end of the day ecopetrols share was one of the three with the largest falls and lost  to   on the other hand the canadian company pacific rubiales was the hardest hit with the price of black gold not only hitting historical lows reaching a drop of  at a price of   but it closed at a value of   and  down according to experts it is the oil production as well as the abundant supplies in the united states and china that have increased the available supply and have also put pressure on the price of crude so far this year wti has lost  and ecopetrol in what has advanced in  has lost  the correlation between oil prices is direct as long as crude oil does not recover the action of the oil companies will not do so either  adds lopez the canacol oil company share also had a significant drop in bvc as it had a negative variation of  at a price of   in the end it closed with a loss of  at   this sector is governed a lot by political decisions between countries it is possible that we will have an announcement before february  to help stimulate it said lopez thus it is clear that oil stocks are not going through a good time and according to analysts until the price of oil is corrected upwards the situation will not improve in this way what the market expects for next year is that there will be less economic growth compared to  the options edgar romero equity analyst at corredores asociados with this situation the market gives the message of caution the results of the fourth ecopetrols quarter will not be so favorable and everything is linked to the price of oil  andres duarte economic analyst at corficolombiana here the issue is supply as it was decided at the opec meeting that there will not be a reduction in supply then oil prices will not rise pacific rubiales and ecopetrol shares plummet at the start of the session on the bvc the ecopetrol security at  in the morning registered a decrease of  at a price of   and the pacific rubiales share showed a fall of  to   the president of pacific rubiales jose francisco arata has said that for the  budget oil prices are expected between us   and us   a barrel however according to analysts crude oil could touch the levels of us   which would put the leading companies in this sector in troublewith falls in ecopetrol pacific and canacol colcap erased annual profits despite the fact that some analysts consider that the markets have already been assuming part of the falls in crude oil and that the projections for the following year are only positive the shares of the oil companies pacific rubiales ecopetrol and canacol energy yesterday they collapsed again   and  respectively this partly caused the fall of the colombian stock exchange bvc colcap index which closed at  units with a negative variation of  thus erasing the good results that had been presented so far this year year and reporting a negative variation of  for diego franco an analyst at asesoria e inversiones the fall and volatility in oil prices added to the already difficult situation that the world stock markets had been experiencing since september and the reflection of that situation was the exit of foreign investors from the market local the price war in relation to the good production that comes from the us of crude oil caused all the markets to focus attention on thursdays opec meeting and according to the analyst the market had already been discounting and speculating in part on a rigid stance on the part of saudi arabia in relation to the reduction of production to stabilize prices  the opec decision in the end was not to intervene and kept production at  million barrels per day which was frowned upon by most investors and caused brent and wti to continue to decline for analysts the organizations decision is to wait for the markets to stabilize themselves a longterm measure in terms of the local equity market the problem according to franco is that it has been showing a rather erratic trend which has generated much stronger falls than those of the rest of latin american stock markets although it is true that the fall in hydrocarbons affects colombia more strongly since the oil companies have a lot of influence on the stock market the panic that has arisen due to the uncertainty and lack of clarity about the level of it will stabilize the barrel of oil it has also generated the liquidation of shares by investors initially natural tired of the behavior of the bvc which has affected other market actions  for its part the most affected of the week was the pacific rubiales share which saw its price fall by   in just five days this since it added to the bad moment of the sector the fact that investors are speculating about a possible nonrenewal for  of campo rubiales the stock closed yesterday at   under this scenario the market will begin to regulate its prices over time and the basket of the hydrocarbon sector will gradually adjust to this however the situation is expected to be for the next  or  months what is still not certain is at what price this stability will occur it is speculated that it could be between us   and us   per barrel and that the infrastructure sector and the good moment of the country will improve the situationrattle for the presidency of ecopetrol adds to the bad hour of oil the alarms are sounding again for a possible change in the presidency of ecopetrol the main company in the country the rumors about the departure of javier genaro gutierrez occur at a difficult time for the company due to the fall in international oil prices a dollar over   that makes its imports more expensive and the uncertainty that the data generates about the action which yesterday fell  and closed at   the three main oil companies ecopetrol pacific rubiales and canacol continue to fall because the international price does not recover however the rumor does generate a lot of noise for the next meeting and it is very bad because more than a change the company needs a person with knowledge in the sector said camilo silva founder of alianza valores this opinion is shared by the former minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta who believes that the country and the company should focus not on the changes of command of the state oil company but on the decisions that must be taken to face this situation of low prices and keep the barrel competitive  the decision of the junta no matter how imminent gutierrezs departure sounds the decision could take its time as it will have to be submitted to the board of directors and announced to the more than  shareholders the decision will be in the hands of the board made up of mauricio cardenas minister of finance tomas gonzalez minister of mines and energy and simon gaviria director of national planning and the independent members gonzalo restrepo president of the board of directors horacio ferreira representative of the producing regions roberto steiner representative of the minority shareholders jorge pinzon joaquin moreno and luis fernando ramirez the next board meeting is scheduled to take place on december  to discuss the  investment plan the  strategy and possibly the change in the presidency on the rattle are the names of juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance federico renjifo former minister of mines and energy camilo marulanda former president of cenit and three members of the board of directors pinzon moreno and ramirez the rattle of each year the presidency of ecopetrol is one of the most controversial and soughtafter positions in the country to the point that it is often referred to as a letter of political favors not in vain during the last three years new names have sounded for the position that javier genaro gutierrez occupies since  jorge ricardo navia president of the board of fendipetroleo believes that this could be a time for changes but it depends on the course that the company is looking for to have new profitability fronts opinions manuel maiguashca former vice minister of mines and energy every year at this time rumors about the departure of javier genaro increase i think that in difficult times like this he should continue ecopetrol would postpone investments in the following year due to low oil prices ecopetrol the countrys largest company and one of the busiest in the local market plans to reveal its  investment plan in the middle of this month analysts predict that it will be lower than the one set for this year of us   million two senior company executives told reuters on condition of anonymity that one of the projects that would be postponed would be the planned modernization of the barrancabermeja refinery the largest in the country ecopetrol like any of the oil companies when it has a price reality like the one you are seeing today it is reviewing its entire investment plan it is looking at two things how it is more cost efficient and what are the projects that could be postponed given this reality of prices gonzalez told reporters depending on what price levels we have going forward the nature of the adjustment will depend he explained the officials comments were added to those of finance minister mauricio cardenas who said on tuesday that a high estimate of investments by the oil company would be around  billion dollars both gonzalez and cardenas are part of the board of directors of ecopetrol a company that produces almost  percent of the oil in colombia the stock of the oil company rose  in the session to   however the companys paper accumulates a  drop so far this yearjavier gutierrez pemberty would not be ecopetrols president next year thus the candidates to replace gutierrez who has been in office since  would be juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance federico renjifo former minister of mines and energy camilo marulanda former president of cenit and three members of the board of directors jorge pinzon joaquin moreno and luis fernando ramirez however the decision on the continuity of gutierrez will be taken on december  in the companys board of directors in which mauricio cardenas minister of finance tomas gonzalez minister of mines and energy and simon gaviria director will participate of national planning and the independent members gonzalo restrepo president of the board of directors horacio ferreira representative of the producing regions roberto steiner representative of the minority shareholders jorge pinzon joaquin moreno and luis fernando ramirez finally after making a determination it would have to be shared with the  shareholders of the companyoil man and  years of experience the profile to preside over ecopetrol after having been in the presidency of ecopetrol for almost eight years javier genaro gutierrez will leave the oil company which will open the vacancy for one of the most desired positions in the country a source close to the companys board of directors confirmed to lr that gutierrezs departure is imminent so the board of directors will begin with the search for a new head for the company the director who graduated from civil engineering from the universidad de los andes a specialist in finance and a masters degree in industrial engineering has been in charge of leading processes such as the two issues of shares of the company acquisitions and agreements with other oil companies in fact this is not the first low price crisis faced by the manager because between  and  when prices went from being over us   to us   he also had to move the company forward the departure of javier genaro gutierrez would be very unfortunate because i think he has done an excellent job and the recent drop in the share price has nothing to do with his management it would seem really surprising to me if that argument was used to remove him from office said former finance minister guillermo perry despite this the manager will leave ecopetrol after  years and the board will have to find a replacement for him the decision will be made by government representatives mauricio cardenas minister of finance tomas gonzalez minister of mines and energy and simon gaviria director of national planning and the independent members gonzalo restrepo president of the board of directors horacio ferreira representative of the producing regions roberto steiner representative of the minority shareholders jorge pinzon joaquin moreno and luis fernando ramirez although the company has not confirmed an extraordinary meeting it is expected that between today and before next december  when the ordinary meeting will be held the members will meet to define how to proceed with the appointment of the new president in fact today a committee will be held in the company with the presence of minister gonzalez however the task will not be easy as headhunters consulted point out that a company like ecopetrol requires the highest executive profile managerial training experience of about  years at the head of large companies an oil career and knowledge in the international energy sector the board will have to do a thorough analysis because the big oil companies are managed by people with a history in the sector that is career oilmen said pablo agustin londono partner at ct partners for beltran benjumea manager of michael page the issue of training is key but the experience that one has in the energy sector weighs more ecopetrol which has more and more international components requires a person fluent in languages experience abroad and leadership and closeness to operations at least he must have  years in the management of large companies he said other aspects highlighted by the experts are related to the management of politics in oilproducing countries because ecopetrols business is set by international prices and it must be taken into account that the political decisions of the producers have an important impact on those prices the rattle throughout gutierrezs career at ecopetrol nine names have been called to replace him in office without any having been specified now that the call is reopened juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance camilo marulanda former president of cenit transportation subsidiary of the oil company and joaquin moreno member of the board are the closest options to the position see boxes but the names may not meet the expectations for this position the candidates who have sounded in the last six years are people with qualities far inferior to gutierrez some of the names that have been raised do not have two characteristics at the same time high management capacity and long experience in the sector  added perry the effects on the action regardless of what ecopetrols decision is what happens around the presidency will become relevant information for the company which must be notified to the financial superintendence and the new york and lima markets these announcements could generate uncertainty among shareholders about what will happen to their investments and alleviate or aggravate the fall in the security which yesterday closed at   with this the price added a fall of  compared to the day of wednesday this is just one more of the problems that the oil company must face which is also concerned about the rising price of the dollar due to its imports and foreign debt and the constant fall in international oil prices the latter maintained the downward trend yesterday the wti reached us   per barrel  while the brent was at us    at the closing of the edition the political debate ecopetrol is a company that contributes to the state some   billion a year that is  of the current income of the nation thanks to its importance for the economy it has become a political letter for the current president however this mechanism is criticized by the sector which awaits an appointment on merit i do not think it is convenient that a person who has managed the company well like javier genaro gutierrez should leave due to political conditions said fabio echeverry former president of the ecopetrol board of directors both businessmen and experts hope that in the meetings of the next few days the members take these issues into account to name the best replacement for gutierrez pemberthy the meeting of december  is maintained the oil company confirmed yesterday that for several months it called the ordinary board of directors for december  and that it will maintain that date regardless of what happens in the next few days the meeting is expected to define topics on next years investment plan which would be reduced by more than us   million and which will be presented in the middle of this month in addition to the growth strategy with which the company will operate at  both components will define the priority projects in the coming years among which the barrancabermeja refinery would be postponed the opinions juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance pro at  years old echeverry has been minister of finance and president of the board of directors of the banco de la republica so he has extensive knowledge of the countrys finances and the importance of the oil company for the nation this will allow you to defend the interests of ecopetrol to increase your profitability against one of the main reproaches to echeverrys career is his short experience as a manager in the private sector although he has a microeconomic background it will not be enough to manage a company of the size of ecopetrol added to this is his lack of experience in the oil sector camilo marulanda former president of cenit pro marulanda an economist from the universidad de los andes has experience in the oil sector because he was in charge of cenit the transportation subsidiary of ecopetrol for more than a year in fact thanks to his experience in the business sector his name was also on the rattle to preside over andi against at only  years old marulanda is a bit young for a position like the presidency of ecopetrol that requires at least  years of experience as a manager although he has a good career at ecopetrol his resume does not include a managerial position in another large company joaquin moreno independent member of the board of directors pro moreno has a degree in civil engineering from the university of santander since  he entered the oil sector through shell a company in which he built a career of more than  years of experience this year he joined the board of directors of ecopetrol so he knows the key issues for the company against although moreno is widely known in the sector and has a history and knowledge of oil he does not have many letters in his favor among the members of the government that are part of the board of directors of ecopetrol and who would prefer to support their own quota to lead the state  opinions fabio echeverry former president of the ecopetrol board of directors i do not think it is convenient that a person who has managed the company well such as javier genaro gutierrez should leave due to political conditions juan camilo restrepo former minister of finance these anticipated rumors are not good because ecopetrol is not an official company but a mixed economy company so its decisions affect the market and stocks pablo agustin londono partner ct partners the board must do a thorough analysis because the big oil companies are managed by people with a history in the sector that is career oilmenecopetrol receives a patent that improves and optimizes information in the search for hydrocarbons this patent the first generated in the exploration area is called  seismic acquisition method with sinusoidal geometry and it serves to reduce noise or interference in seismic acquisition processes resulting in a better quality of the information collected  the patented development is valid for  years and is ecopetrols  recognition of industrial property so far in  in total the company has  current patentsecopetrol stock continues to decline trading below   the falls in the price of oil and the generalized crisis in the different stock markets of the world have also hit the local market and the main titles of the colcap index which so far has fallen by the genaros in fedecafe and ecopetrol the heads desired by the national government the government of president juan manuel santos is targeting two genaros who have remained in their positions despite constant rumors about their departures luis genaro munoz manager of the national federation of coffee growers fedecafe the union most traditional and important in the country and javier genaro gutierrez president of ecopetrol the main company in colombia although the leaders have reaffirmed their positions in recent days they have again faced speculation about their retirements a week ago the president of the federation again felt the onslaught of the committees of huila cauca risaralda cundinamarca and antioquia who asked him to step aside the government needs a great collaborator someone who from the federation has a fluid dialogue with the public and the coffee growers luis genaro munoz has faced the government and is the only manager who has done it in all his years said guillermo trujillo former secretary of fedecafe the ambassador in london nestor osorio and the director of corpoica juan lucas restrepo are some of the names that have come up to replace munoz every time his resignation is requested from the sectors work stoppages in  to congress nacional de cafeteros that ended last friday despite this controversy munoz extended his stay in the union at  years of age and with  years of experience in the federation it is inconvenient for the government to reach out to an organization that has its procedures that decision must be mutually agreed between the parties added carlos ramirez representative of valle on the national committee changes in ecopetrol now that the situation around munoz has calmed down the turn is for javier genaro gutierrez who has his days numbered at ecopetrol he will retire at age  and after being in the presidency for more than seven years in their place the names of juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance and letter of the government and camilo marulanda general director of operations of ecopetrol and favorite of the board but filling gutierrezs vacancy will not be easy because the executive has extensive experience in the energy sector  years for  years he was manager of isa and has been at the helm of the most important company in the country for more than seven years javier genaros management has been so good and with so much support that it has been difficult for the government to remove him from the presidency said guillermo perry former minister of finance this will lead to the decision of the nine members of the board being fought because as in the federation the government also wants to strengthen its power in a company that leaves close to   billion per year between taxes royalties and dividends selection process would be presented much has been said about gutierrezs departure from the ecopetrol presidency but the oil company has not yet come out to deny or confirm the rumors despite the fact that it is relevant information that is affecting the action and affects the investor interests and it does not seem that the situation will be clarified soon since the board is scheduled to meet next friday december  and if determined the procedure for appointing gutierrezs replacement will be announced as a listed company there are procedures that must be followed if that decision is made it must be announced within  hours if it is not done the company can be sanctioned said a source from the oil company opinions guillermo trujillo former secretary of the federation of coffee growers the government needs a great collaborator someone who from the federation has a fluid dialogue with the public and the coffee growers guillermo perry former finance minister javier genaros management has been so good and with so much support that it has been difficult for the government to remove him from the presidencyecopetrol epm and bancolombia the most responsible large colombian companies or companies with a presence in the country were rated by experts who work on issues of corporate social responsibility csr and the results of the survey showed that all companies are between a regular and good level on the subject within the survey which was carried out by the firm cifras  conceptos the best classified and which are in the process of improvement were ecopetrol with  nutresa  bancolombia  epm  and pacific rubiales also with  these companies are recognized as firms that effectively apply the principles of csr however it is considered that they still need to further stimulate the interest of managers and the vision of the organization on the subject according to the expert in csr gustavo yepes director of management and csr of the externado although there has been a change in paradigm and he has in favor that he managed to overcome good intentions and recognize the relationship of social problems with the impact of actions and decisions of the company on its environment this is still a suboptimal solution since any csr strategy is clearly insufficient compared to the expectations that society has about the large contemporary business organization within the great list those that lead are private companies and with some exceptions public companies that are considered to have the least interest in the subject another important aspect that was highlighted in the results is that  of people would be willing to pay between  and  more for a brand that has a social purpose which would generate an incentive for entrepreneurs to invest more in this type of projects that not only contribute to society but to their incomesummary of the year ecopetrol epm and terpel continue in the top of the highest sales what did not change much were the sectors that moved sales the most during  no economic activity took away the eternal leadership in operating income from the miningenergy sector which is headed by ecopetrol the oil company went from a turnover of   billion in  to   billion in  industry spokespersons assured that the continuous progress of oil exploration which was highlighted last year by the discovery of new wells as well as institutional strengthening of the sector consolidated a good year for the hydrocarbon market one of the most important achievements of  is that the national oil production has been above a million barrels a day said the minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta medina at that time it is followed by the retail sector which like last year had a good representation in the group of the first  companies that sold the most standing out firms such as almacenes exito easy colombia sodimac falabella or almacenes la  in fact  this segment was one of those that contributed the most to the gross domestic product gdp of the real sector closing last year with sales of   billion an increase of  compared to  another sector that the outstanding item on last years income balance was food although the growth of the sector was not high compared to  almost  as confirmed by maria carolina lorduy executive director of the andi chamber of the food industry the sector contributed  to the national gdp and managed to maintain important companies of this market among the  firms that sold the most in colombia some of them are bavaria nestle alimentos carnicos unilever quala and ingenio del cauca the food sector was one of the few sectors that in the endofyear industrial balance showed positive figures compared to  despite the fact that its growth was minimal around  in gross production and sales said lorduy the fourth sector that moved the most money in colombia was concentrated in telecommunications this category managed to place claro telmex colombia colombia telecomunicaciones movistar and colombia movil tigo among the first among the first  companies with the highest turnover in the country at the end of  the penetration of the use of technology and telecommunications in colombia could be greater if there were no problems and failures in issues such as infrastructure and quality last year important issues were achieved such as the opening of the  process but there was a long way to go in improving services said julian cardona president of aciem operating revenues for the top  topselling companies alone totaled more than   billion what does the economy show as positive of the general balance of the colombian economy last year the only lunar was industrial activity which had negative figures except for this sector the countrys growth was notorious and is shown by the following data an inflation of  an increase in general consumption of  compared to  a direct foreign investment that closed at us   million an annual rise of  and a level of unemployment that for the first time in history is in the single digits  for the economics professor at universidad del rosario gonzalopalau these macroeconomic figures are highly positive they help the business sector and added that the ftas are just a beginning for growthjavier genaro gutierrez will leave the presidency of ecopetrol at the next shareholders meeting ecopetrols board of directors confirmed today that it decided to start the selection process for the new president of the countrys main oil company and that it hopes that javier gutierrezs successor will be known at the next general shareholders meeting in march today began the meeting between the nine members of the board to resolve the future of the state company in the midst of a difficult situation for the oil sector and rumors of changes in the leadership of the most important company in the country the selection process for the new president of ecopetrol will be led by the board of directors which will be supported by an international company specialized in the search for senior executives the company told the financial superintendence although the process will last until another year it is already being sought that whoever succeeds him not only matches his technical profile and experience in the field but also has the support of the majority of the members of the board according to article  of ecopetrols bylaws this type of decision is deliberated with a number equal to or greater than five of its members and decisions are made by majority vote the former minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta explained that usually the difference in opinions is such that the vote is set aside and a consensus process begins that usually takes weeks as happened with the debate around the star technology in addition the balance of power in the company is balanced since none of the votes has preference over the others and most of the members are independent there are only three government officials on the board of directors this independent nature implies that the ministers participating in the session represent one more actor although that does not mean that there is no communication on their part or that their preferences are expressed in front of others acosta stressed for now the former minister of finance juan carlos echeverry and the general director of operations of ecopetrol camilo marulanda sound as successors several industry experts have agreed that gutierrezs achievements make him an executive whose management will be difficult to match during his administration he assumed the two issues of shares of the company as well as the acquisition of other oil companies he even dodged without major shocks the low price crisis that occurred between  and  when the price of a barrel of oil went from us   to us   he has done an excellent job summarized former finance minister guillermo perry however it is a position in which not all experts agree such as former deputy minister of energy orlando cabrales who considers that the company requires a change of leadership the election of the president in accordance with the aforementioned statutes is given for periods of two years but he can be reelected indefinitely or freely removed from office before the expiration of the period the responsibility that falls on the board of directors whose members are elected by the general assembly of shareholders for appointing an executive of the highest profile may not occur in the framework of todays ordinary meeting so it is not ruled out that a additional sessions even until   shareholders waiting for the decision to be made once the type of change the oil company will go through is defined the decision must be communicated to the  shareholders in addition since the company is registered in the colombian stock exchange bvc a series of procedures must be followed with respect to the handling of information including that if a final resolution is declared the firm has a term of  hours to announce it in this way the manipulation of privileged information is avoided and the action is protected from speculation and consequently investors money opinions amylkar acosta former minister of mines and energy the presidency does not have to be defined today perhaps only the rules of the game will be determined and the subject will be left for a later meeting although since the rumor was known there has been space to arrive to consensus  orlando cabrales former deputy minister of energy it is true that ecopetrol requires a change of leadership but it is a decision that corresponds exclusively to the board of directors and that if it wants to it can be resolved even todaymercado approved changes in the leadership of ecopetrol the market welcomed the announcement that ecopetrol made yesterday about the process that its board of directors began to replace javier genaro gutierrez in the presidency despite the fact that after the news the stock had a sharp fall to   it managed to recover and closed the day at   although the data had a drop of  compared to the close of last wednesday a bigger drop was expected as a result of international oil prices the wti closed at us   while the brent was located in us   this caused the shares of companies such as pacific rubiales and canacol to fall much more  and  respectively said camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones the market is optimistic with ecopetrol because it confirmed yesterday that as part of the redirection process which began this year the search for a new president will begin with the help of an international headhunting firm the oil company indicated to the financial superintendency that it expects that the result of the transition and connection between the current president and whoever succeeds him can be concluded and reported at the next ordinary meeting of the general assembly of shareholders that is in march of  javier genaro gutierrez has done an excellent job at ecopetrol and led the company successfully but he has already completed a cycle and a person with greater strategic vision is needed who knows how to determine the strategic focuses said julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons of the ministry of mines and energy the firm also highlighted those achievements and hopes to find a person with that level investment plan another blow for oil stocks another of the main issues that ecopetrols board of directors was dealing with yesterday was the investment plan for  and which as expected will fall by more than us   million the news had not been announced at press time but its publication will be another blow to the title of the oil company whoever becomes president will have to know how to manage these issues because the external situation is very difficult at the moment added julio cesar vera opinions camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones the board of directors was smart to shake off the rumors about political influence in the appointment of the president at such a crucial moment for the companyecopetrol announced that its investment plan for  will be us   million the sharp drop comes from the   billion that the company and its subsidiaries allocated for this years programecopetrols investment in  will amount to us   million the main company in the country ecopetrol announced yesterday that its investment plan for next year will be us   million which means a sharp fall of  compared to the amount allocated for  us   million the largest percentage of resources will be directed to production the completion of the modernization of the cartagena refinery and the strengthening of transport capacity the oil company pointed out that this budget is aligned with the corporate strategy that is being built and allows the company to adjust to the international environment which once again shows the effect that the drop in international prices had on the companys accounts the situation will also lead ecopetrol to prioritize its investments and put aside projects that are not very productive in the medium term to focus on those that give value to the action the plan to reduce operating costs and expenses amounts to us   million without prejudice to additional optimizations that are being studied by the board the statement said that is why the oil company believes that despite this cut it will maintain the same production level of   barrels equivalent oil and gas price drop continues international crude prices remained down yesterday wti closed at   while brent was at us   ecopetrol recovers and is once again above   on the colombian stock exchange bvc at that time among the most valued shares were canacol which presented a positive variation of  at a price of   followed by pacific rubiales which had an increase of  to   meanwhile the stock that fell the most was enka with a decrease of  to  on the first trading day of the year ecopetrols share began to decline with  the most traded shares on the first trading day in colombia were ecopetrol with   million and grupo aval with   million the securities with the greatest decreases were ecopetrol from  to   occidente  to   and eeb  to   the stock market capitalization index colcap closed at  units with a drop of  starting the year without recovery of the negative variation of  which today was  the liquidity index also closed in positive but with a timid  to  unitsthe four factors that would complicate ecopetrols finances this year the first is related to the constant fall in international oil prices which yesterday reached a cumulative fall of more than  in just six months both for brent us   and for wti us    analysts believe that this drop will continue in the coming months which will lead to ecopetrol and other oil companies having to maintain an austerity plan and obtain lower profits the barrel is going to be stable at us   or us   i dont think we will reach such low levels close to us   because that means that many projects would be unviable even for the arab countries explained julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines and energy the second factor has to do with the change in the presidency of ecopetrol which would be defined at the next ordinary shareholders meeting in march the board of directors announced in december the departure of javier genaro gutierrez after eight years in office and a recognized career so the market is attentive to the person who comes to replace him meets the high technical profile required by the company and it is not for less because ecopetrol contributes to the country around   billion a year including taxes royalties and profits and it needs to maintain that rhythm so as not to affect the finances of the state there is a lot of volatility in the stock due to the change that will take place in the presidency we continue to call for a person with knowledge of the sector said camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones greater security the third factor that the government will have to face in order to facilitate the situation for ecopetrol is in the social sphere as the former minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta analyzed the causes that hold back exploration and production are already known the terrorist attacks the blockades and social protests and the delays in the environmental licensing processes as well as in the process prior consultations  in  alone the colombian petroleum association acp estimates that the sector suffered more than  attacks for which companies stopped marketing more than   billion if a brake is put on this year operating costs which have become more expensive will drop francisco lloreda president of the acp recently pointed out for the president of campetrol ruben dario lizarralde reducing these costs will be key so that in the midst of international uncertainty companies have no other reason to leave the country because operating here is more expensive than in other producing countries stock would remain down the last scenario considers the effects that the three factors mentioned above are going to have on the stock of the oil company in yesterdays session the title had a new fall of  and closed at   the fall could deepen in the coming days taking into account that barrel prices would remain down the share price not only reflects the current or tomorrows price but also the production in the medium and long term so ecopetrol must maintain the seismic rhythm and its investments in exploration to send a positive message lizarralde added the blow for the nation this years budget which had a deficit of   billion and which encouraged tax reform highlighted the importance of this industry which represents more than  of exports  of exports the countrys current income contributed  of gdp in the third quarter see graph and in one month it can finance a year of programs such as familias en accion despite this the minister of finance mauricio cardenas pointed out that the   billion that they would stop receiving this year for oil income would compensate it with the tax reform that allows us to compensate for half of the fall in tax income resulting from the lower prices the other half will be assumed via a higher fiscal deficit  the days will confirm how easy or not the task will be the market is waiting for reficar the market has its eyes set on the operations of the cartagena refinery reficar because to the extent that it enters operations in the first quarter it could be a positive message for investors and stop the stock drop silva explained all plants are scheduled to be ready in the first quarter and the testing and splicing period with the old facilities will end in august from that moment there would be a return on the investments made in reficar the opinions julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons of the minminas the internal processes of ecopetrol are understood but i think that a quarter to define the president generates many movements in the stock market camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones colombia cannot live without oil first because the bulk of its finances correspond to the income left by the activity ruben dario lizarralde president of campetrol if ecopetrol maintains the thought of investing for the medium and long term in exploration it could be successful at any timeecopetrol reports record production in the chichimene field in meta crude oil extraction on january  reached  barrels per day on average compared to the  that were expected to date the company reported in a statement it is worth noting that only in the last year the production of this field has almost doubled in january of last year it amounted to  barrels per day with the team we set goals and we build the strategies to achieve them one of them consisted of sponsoring a well each one of the members of the management was in charge of monitoring it to guarantee the entry into production on the required date  explained orlando mauricio sanchez bahamon manager of the field thanks to these levels of extraction chichimene is positioned as the third producing field in the countryin the midst of the crisis ecopetrol shows signs of recovery in production in the midst of the crisis created by the drop in international oil prices ecopetrol gave the market good news yesterday by announcing that it reached a new record production of crude in the chichimene field an area that it operates directly the complex located in meta reached an extraction of  barrels of oil per day bpd on january  that is  more than the  expected for that date thanks to this figure ecopetrol continues to consolidate chichimene as the third producing field in colombia after rubiales and castilla orlando sanchez manager e of the field explained that the result is due to a strategy to sponsor the area that in the last year has almost doubled its production in january   barrels were extracted according to the company after the announcement the stock of the oil company showed a recovery of  thus the title stabilized at   at the end of the day after having registered   in previous days the news is very good because it shows that production continues to improve but having broken the barrier of us   for the wti that hits very hard on all stocks in the oil sector and that is much more shocking said alejandro reyes director of investigations of ultraburstiles in addition the announcement of an increase in the recovery is not as relevant for shareholders as that of a new finding the analyst specified as of press time the wti had reached us   while the brent was trading at us   relief for the state coffers the message is also a relief for the national market and the countrys finances because in the face of the accumulated drop of more than  in the price of a barrel the minister of finance mauricio cardenas has insisted that the companies must increase their production and it is not for less because for every dollar that a barrel falls the state stops receiving about   million per year from oil income according to the accounts of the mediumterm fiscal framework mfmp only in terms of royalties they stop collecting about   million between june  and yesterday the price has fallen by about us   so the deficit would be about   billion but if the devaluation is taken into account which has been almost  a balance of   billion could be calculated  explained the former minister of mines and energy amylkar acosta that is why both ecopetrol and the other oil companies have two paths in sight to keep pace with their investments in exploration a difficult task that will not be accomplished because cuts have already been announced or increase the recovery of existing fields for which the development of new technologies will be vital it will also depend on these two alternatives that this years fiscal deficit does not deepen and the states social programs are affectedthe state companies ecopetrol and isa and cueros velez start the year in search of a new president these days there are three companies that are looking for a new president to face the economic and financial challenges that  brings the state companies ecopetrol and isa and the private company cueros velez today face the need to choose ceo and general manager due to different circumstances in which are administrative decisions and resignations ricardo mejia an expert in companies highlighted that the positions of the three companies are different and that is why the challenge for companies is to choose a manager who has enough training and experience to succeed him according to the expert there must be a mix between internal knowledge of the firm and also of the market and its variables in the case of ecopetrol the board of directors announced that it began a process of succession to gutierrez and that he will be advised by a headhunting company whoever arrives will have the difficulty of overcoming the minimum oil prices and increase the net profit of   billion in the third quarter of  on the side of isa which received the resignation of luis fernando alarcon and will present its new president at the shareholders meeting in march the new manager must continue with the financial activity of the energy company which had an increase of  in its profits in the case of velez the new manager will have to fight to consolidate the international expansion of the company that has countries in the region in its sights javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol coming from the company interconectado electrica sa where he had worked since  javier gutierrez pemberthy assumed the presidency of ecopetrol the bestselling company in the country in  with more than   billion in revenues this bogota executive a civil engineer from the universidad de los andes with a masters degree in industrial engineering

reputation in the country by the business monitor of corporate reputation merco of spain two years later lr awarded him the distinction as businessman of the year due to his management at the head of

general management of cueros velez and during his tenure the aggressive strategy of the firm was highlighted by entering the more than  registered shopping centers in the country and with him at the head the company achieved net income of   million in  ricardo mejia business expert the challenge for boards of directors is to train good experienced successors these organizations are a good pool to choose new presidents  jorge ricardo navia president of the fendipetroleo board at ecopetrol it could be a time for changes but it depends on the direction the company is seeking to have new profitability frontspacific canacol ecopetrol and petrobras lost  of their value in five months the volatility of the oil price takes its toll on the market value of oil companies a survey with some of the most representative for colombia shows that these companies today cost on average  less than they did five months ago with these movements the ranking of oil companies will change again the most recent count carried out by the consultancy energy intelligence is led by saudi aramco from saudi arabia nioc from iran china cnpc and exxon mobil of the united states it is followed by pdvsa shell bp gazprom rosneft and chevron behind are companies in the region such as petrobras of brazil and pemex of mexico which occupy places  and  respectively ecopetrol was among the first  but in position  for the analysts in the new ranking it is possible that all of them will drop from position looking at the specific data according to bloomberg exxons share in the united states went from a price of us   on august  to us   last friday which means a reduction of  but this is not the one with the biggest drop the first place goes to pacific rubiales according to the data in august it was traded on the colombian stock exchange at   and last week it closed at   that is a fall of  canacol has lost  petrobras  and ecopetrol  for the analyst of the alianza valores stock market cristian hernandez the strategy that the oil companies should take is to reduce their operating costs as much as possible being more efficient than before on the other hand they should concentrate on generating cash flow reducing their investment plan and focusing more on the development of fields seeking at the same time the most profitable high netback than on exploratory activity  an opinion shared by jairo julian agudelo manager of equity research at grupo bancolombia who assures that when there is such a significant decrease in their income due to the drop in crude prices oil companies should focus on seeking cost efficiency and increase production in its most profitable fields in order to improve its margins  in addition he points out that as long as oil prices continue at these levels oil companies will not justify continuing with aggressive exploratory campaigns since the risk they are assuming when exploring will not be offset by the sale of crude at high prices companies have listened to this and therefore have reduced their investment budgets and adjusted the accounts to have a healthy  what the companies have done in the colombian case ecopetrol said that its investment plan for next year will be us   million which means a sharp fall of  compared to the amount allocated for  us   million the largest percentage of resources will be directed to production the completion of the modernization of the cartagena refinery and the strengthening of transport capacity pacific rubiales assured that cost reduction will remain a priority we estimate that with these adjustments operating costs will be around us   per barrel what benefits us at an exchange rate of the colombian peso the innumerable cost reduction initiatives that have been underway since the end of  and a decrease due to the acquisition of lower services will be a reality average royalty and tax rates are expected to decline due to low oil prices said ronald pantin ceo of the canadian company as for canacol we still do not know what their budget or investment plan will be as they have been postponing the information pending a well exploration according to the statement released by the company it was confirmed that gas sales from esperanza and ecuador  of total production in the third quarter of  are completely insensitive to international oil prices in addition it decided to postpone drilling the canandonga  exploration well at esperanza and instead to drill the nelson  development well in its operated nelson gas field for daniel velandia director of economic research at credicorp capital even though this is positive news for canacol we stay away from the company since high debt levels and insufficient cash generation is a concern with current price levels of the oil this being the case adjustments are being made but hard times are coming for the sector shareholders are the most affected by low prices for jairo julian agudelo restrepo manager of equity research at grupo bancolombia the impact is a lower value of the portfolio which could generate a negative wealth effect since the profitability of the investments has been negative for investors who have shares in the oil sector in recent months  undoubtedly investors have been affected but that is not why they should go out and sell all their shares one of the recommendations is to remain calm and evaluate whether it is necessary to exit the investment because as the price of oil can change in any time then the securities can recover part of the value lost in these five months opinions ronald pantin ceo of pacific rubiales the uncertainty over the price of oil continues and although we believe that prices will recover we are reducing both costs and budget daniel velandia dir economic investigations credicorp capital we stay away from canacol since high debt levels and insufficient cash generation is a concern with oil price levels charle gamba executive chairman of canacol energy the company plans to publish the budget and production target for calendar year  after conducting production tests for the clarinete  wellecopetrol will have a year of changes and uncertainty in  in colombia particularly it will be a difficult year for the state oil company ecopetrol which in addition to external variables will have to face a change in the main management position with the arrival of the president who replace the one who has held the position for more than eight years javier gutierrez pemberthy ecopetrol is the largest company in colombia it generates more than  of the national production what happens with the oil company will have significant effects on the accounts of the government the largest owner of the company with  of the shares the effects will be stronger if the downward trend in the price of black gold continues since for example in  the company transferred   billion to the nation via taxes and dividends the recent announcements made by the company are a reflection of the difficult year with which the oil company closed which will be careful in  given the uncertainty about the recovery of the international price which has fallen by around  since the second half of  and that according to analysts it would not rebound during the first semester of the year an outlook that led the national government to revise this years economic growth target downward and place it at  the new presidency navigating the world oil scenario will be the main challenge of the new administration after last december the board of directors of ecopetrol confirmed the rumors that had been ringing about a change in the presidency and announced that as part of the redirection the strategic plan would initiate a process of succession in the position held by gutierrez since january  the names of camilo marulanda lopez former president of cenit a subsidiary of ecopetrol in charge of the administration of the funds came to the fore as possible candidates to assume this position pipelines and that of juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance and former dean of economics of the universidad de los andes among others the support that an international firm specialized in the search for senior executives is carrying out to the board of directors the competent body to select and appoint the new president has given investors a piece of reassurance considering that the decision will not be anchored to a conjuncture policy but will be done with the objectivity and the best criteria that determination requires for the financial analyst and manager of fenix valor orlando santiago jacome the focus and profile of gutierrezs successor should be that of a professional who is clearly an oilman hopefully he will be a recognized professional especially in the field and exploration in the hydrocarbon sector  beyond the uncertainty due to the arrival of a new leader in the current situation jacome affirms that a refreshment in the presidency with someone who contributes new ideas especially in relation to exploration will be good for ecopetrol in a moment in which that is one of its shortcomings the change in the presidency is good from an operational and financial point of view  at the same time gonzalo palau professor from the faculty of economics of the universidad del rosario assured that the person who assumes the presidency must be an expert in business administration who will have to show all his experience and wisdom in doing the most profitable and much more productive company it is time to make big changes and get out of this situation of low prices that was unforeseen a few months ago  he emphasized the cut in investment the new president of the company will have to overcome the externalities of the industry that ended up adjusting the plans contemplated in the longterm strategic framework melp at the end of last year ecopetrol announced a  reduction in its investment budget for  to support the current situation thus while in  the oil company invested us   million this year it will invest us   million in its business areas the company implemented a strict process to reduce operating costs prioritizing strategic investments the plan to reduce operating costs and expenses amounts to us   million and there could be additional cuts that are being studied by the board of directors of the state oil company thus  of the investments will be made in colombia and the remaining  abroad through subsidiaries the largest percentage of the resources will be directed to the strengthening of transportation capacity and the completion of the modernization of the cartagena refinery which would start operations in the second half of  and could positively affect ecopetrols financial results during the year the bulk of the resources will go to the production area with us   million with which it seeks to obtain an equivalent production of crude oil and gas of around  barrels per day which is highlighted by analysts who affirm that the efforts of the company in this  should be oriented to increase production which allows counteracting the low prices the challenge for the company is to become more dynamic and less expensive to seek new sources of production and new explorations said professor palau the effect of the peace process what is the relationship between the peace process and ecopetrols behavior well during the past year the oil infrastructure suffered around  attacks cut to november so analysts consider that the advancement of the peace process will have a positive blow to the state oil company during  the reason is related to the declaration of an indefinite unilateral ceasefire by the farc guerrillas and the announcement of the search for a bilateral ceasefire by the government in addition to the rapprochement with the eln which together would lead to the deescalation of the armed conflict which has hit this industry hard if the peace process continues as it has been presented ecopetrol will directly benefit and if the elns intentions to be part of the peace agreement are added to that it will be much better considering that the eln has an important action in departments where there are oil pipelines  affirmed the analyst and manager of fenix valor jacome the economist and president of global consulting luis alfonso arias agreed on this and considered that with the positive evolution that the peace process has had one of the positive blows will be the reduction and termination of all these attacks allowing ecopetrol to have greater margin of action and that element can lessen the impact of the fall in prices  in this way  will be a year of adjustments and changes in the state oil company but the truth is that uncertainty and nervousness will be present as long as oil prices continue to fall as happened this friday when the wti fell   and was quoted at us   per barrel as did brent which lost  and was quoted at us   although the year will be marked by uncertainty analysts warn that there is no need to dramatize we are at the most critical and worrying moment especially for shareholders but possibly international oil prices may have a slight recovery they will not return for long time at levels of us   but at more acceptable levels which will once again give oxygen to the state company  emphasized the economics teacherecopetrol epm and eeb will participate in round one of energy in mexico round one of the tenders awakened the appetite of colombian companies including ecopetrol empresas publicas de medellin epm and empresa de energia de bogota eeb to participate in the recent opening of the energy sector in mexico therefore which has already started work with local partners in order to present their operational proposals to the mexican government said sergio escobar director of procolombia a government agency that promotes investments and exports from the south american country no less than half a dozen toplevel colombian companies opened offices in mexico to visualize how to develop business either directly or through an alliance merger or joining with local companies in order to serve all the prospects that come in the next few years in the electric power hydrocarbons and gas sectors  the colombian official confirmed to el economista the interest is maintained even despite the hit prices of crude oil observed in recent weeks the mexican mix stood at us   last friday less than half the value it reached in june  when it reached its most expensive point last year interviewed within the framework of his visit to mexico as part of the promotion of colombian companies and the search for business escobar specified that the ecopetrol company is interested in offshore projects in the gulf of mexico medellin public services companies in electric power transmission generation and distribution projects and empresa de energia de bogota is interested in a gas project in nuevo leon there are many sides products and regions to work in and the first proposals will be released soon he said with the energy reform that allowed private participation in activities previously reserved to the state mexico adopted a system based on two successful business models in the world the norwegian and the colombian a factor that makes our country attractive for colombian investors undertake the director of procolombia said that doing business in the energy sector in mexico is like being at home because with the mexican energy reform they took much of the great successes of the colombian industry that developed more than  years ago when questioned about whether the requirements demanded in the round one project are rigid in mexico the colombian manager mentioned that they are complex and sophisticated because in the end the game in the energy sector is complex and it is very different to tender a highway or a logistics project rather than an energy one where a whole business chain will be developed to be structured this is the colombian model with an increase in oil production of more than  which implies that in a decade it increased from  to  million barrels per day and the completion of  processes or rounds of awarding fields to third parties the colombian model of hydrocarbon exploitation formed part of the bases for the design of the mexican energy reform according to the bank of the republic of colombia in the last three years the country has obtained an average foreign investment flow of us   million in the oil sector and with this the colombian energy sector went from a contribution of   to  of gdp plus  of taxes comes from this industry with the new national model the operation of petroleos mexicanos is similar to that of the colombian state company ecopetrol which has  of the market in its country today ecopetrol competes at the same level as any of the other  giants vying for reserves a fundamental part of the  reform was the creation of the national hydrocarbons agency which like the national hydrocarbons commission with its new composition plays the role of regulator and manages the royalty fund that the colombian state receives from the exploitation of private in colombia any company can invest assuming the risk and paying the consequent taxes for its activity which includes the reserves it finds as part of its assets it is a very competitive market colombian lessons that can be applied according to the newspaper el economista colombia and its opening made it possible for national companies to invest in other countries through lessons such as in  the association regime was changed to modern contracts such as licenses and production shared on the other hand ecopetrol modified its statutes and implemented a corporate governance he currently has  of the production in his country in  the national hydrocarbons agency was created which acts as the regulator and administrator of the competition between  oil giants that operate in colombia opinions sergio escobar director of procolombia mexico city commercial office no less than half a dozen toplevel colombian companies opened offices in mexico to see how to develop business either directly or through an alliance juan esteban calle restrepo manager of the epm group the water reuse project in addition to being a great contribution from the ticsa subsidiary to the epm group represents the first collaboration project between the business group and petroleos mexicanos thus fulfilling an objectiveisa and ecopetrol are in the final stretch to find their new president ecopetrol began the search for the replacement of javier gutierrez who will leave the company in march as decided at the last extraordinary meeting of the oil company to run the company several names are already ringing but as with gutierrezs election in  the board of directors will rely on a headhunter to make the choice the firm in charge of finding the candidates will be egon zehnder which recently located the presidents of nutresa and alpina among the possible names that could come to occupy the position the one that is sounding loudest is that of former minister of finance juan carlos echeverry however several unions and part of the board of directors have communicated that despite the great achievements and knowledge of the former ministers finances the company needs at the moment to look for someone more technical and with more knowledge of the sector the name of maria lorena alvarez who would be the female quota for the company and the economist of the universidad de los andes camilo marulanda lopez who is currently in the vicepresidency of strategy and growth of the oil company and who also worked with pg on the board of directors some of its members such as roberto steinner and jorge pinzon have insisted on a more technical than political profile for the new president and that technical profile could come from the board itself since it should not be forgotten that these names along with joaquin moreno uribe also part of the board have sounded for the position for hernando barrero executive director of acipet the new leader must continue to direct the company as it has been doing in recent years since gutierrezs management allowed it to be strengthened positioned and i believe that it has once again proven to be the company leader of the country  for his part alvaro yunes president of fidispetroleo indicated that the new manager must have common sense and great managerial capacity in addition you must know the sector and finally you must keep in mind that you are going to manage the most important company in colombia so you have to enter thinking about all the challenges to improve the equity value of the company make operating costs more efficient generate more exploration and facilitate nonfree migration to other fuels  regarding the challenges mentioned by yunes the former minister of mines amilkar acosta assured that the main challenge is to consolidate the image of ecopetrol as an oil company with a corporate regime that shields it from the temptations of its politicization the biggest challenge for ecopetrol and that it is for the country is the incorporation of more barrels to our precarious reserves and this cannot be achieved with an aggressive exploratory campaign  isa panama is the great challenge the other company that will have a leadership change in march is isa after luis fernando alarcon resigned from the position in december with the election of the new manager of the energy company the tug of war will surely open again between the government and antioquia businessmen who have always had great misgivings with this medellinbased company proof of them was that in  when he came to the leadership of the company it was not enough that he was virgilio barcos former minister of finance or that he had directed the interamerican development bank or that he had a great experience in the private sector as president of asofondos or who had studied at mit or had been part of boards of directors such as avianca or the stock market at that time many of the criticisms from different antioqueno unions had to do with the fact that alarcon was no longer linked to medellin however with his efforts the civil engineer from the universidad de los andes and a management specialist from oxford was coping with the situation and under his administration the firm almost doubled its profits in seven years going from   in  to  in  with the departure of alarcon the director of the energy observatory of the national university german corredor indicated that the challenge facing the company this year is the electrical interconnection with panama and to continue looking for opportunities abroad since  a couple of years ago they didnt make important announcements  finally the rector of the universidad del rosario jose manuel restrepo indicated that he is confident in the possibility of an energy agreement with panama since they have the energy need and colombia can offer them the resource the rattle of the isa manager has not moved there is barely a month and a half left before the isa shareholders meeting at which time it will be necessary to announce who the new manager of the company is and even so the name rattle has not started for the former minister of mines and energy amilkar acosta this is because the board is still undecided in the case of isa the board has not made much progress in the procedure to be followed and for this reason the rattle is still he said lr spoke with several members of the companys board to find out who the manager candidates are but there was no pronouncement opinions alvaro yunes president fidispetroleo it is essential that the new president places the company in the future and innovates in new fuels and not just crude hernando barrero executive director of acipet success begins with getting a person who meets all the qualities and conditions of the profile german corredor director of the national energy observatory i believe that the main challenges for isa are to consolidate development in panama and seek opportunities abroadsic granted a patent to ecopetrol for the heavy crude process with a process that dehydrates heavy crude oil and thus facilitates the extraction and transport of the liquid ecopetrol was awarded a new invention patent the superintendency of industry and commerce sic confirmed through a statement that the granted patent is applicable to the process of dehydration of heavy and extra heavy crude oil through a dilution scheme with this technology ecopetrol advances in obtaining highdensity dehydrated crudes without the need to apply thermal chemical electrical or mechanical treatments to achieve dehydration with which the crudes can be efficiently transported under previously established technical specifications this patent represents a clear example of the virtuous circle of innovation and competition that exists in the hydrocarbon industry which is leading us to find solutions to extend the oil production capacity and therefore the available reserves of colombia said the superintendent of industry and commerce pablo felipe robledo in a statement the sic took  months to grant the patent to ecopetrol a company that in the last  years has requested  certificationsecopetrol and pacific rubiales different cases that confirm the crude panorama of the oil sector although different both ecopetrol and pacific rubiales are going through a hard present framed by research downward projections and other enigmas today it became known through the newspaper el tiempo that the state firm which is still chaired by javier gutierrez pemberthy has a series of problems as a result of bribes to company executives to deliver contracts one of the cases shown by the newspaper is about the payment of some alleged consultancies that joseph sigelman authorized to pay in  when he was the top boss of petrotiger colombia to david orlando duran florez an ecopetrol executive and his wife for an amount of us   to favor the company with a contract of us   million with the asian firm mansarovar for alvaro yunes president of fedispetrol this is a new issue that may not have been perceived in the country the manager stressed that these bribes exemplify the corruption experienced by the spheres of the state and in this case ecopetrol which is the bestselling company in the country will have to face collapses in its action as a result of this news it should be noted that last friday the ecopetrol share closed at   with a negative variation of  in addition it was in the ranking of the most traded shares with a total of   million followed by pacific rubiales energy with   million this last company is precisely another of those that is confirming the difficulty of the national hydrocarbon sector the newspaper el espectador highlighted in a report the uncertain future that the company listed on the toronto stock exchange will face as long as the prices of a barrel of crude do not raise their heads and remain below us   the publication highlighted several factors that show that the firm left behind its prime the first is the decision of the colombian stock exchange that ordered to increase the guarantees to carry out operations with the shares of the company the second was the ratification by the financial superintendency to monitor the share price decline and the third the announcement by the superintendency of companies on financial and legal monitoring it also reports the dismissal of  employees cancellation of contracts rethinking of conditions and delays in payments to suppliers although it was highlighted that the managers have affirmed that the company is solid and will face the situation with measures already taken jose manuel restrepo rector of the universidad del rosario said that the moment of the hydrocarbons sector is difficult because low prices of a barrel of oil are budgeted during the first semester this reason makes companies have to adjust costs reducing labor reorganize and also reduce and close the drilling and exploitation of wells  according to el espectador recently the supersociedades received more than ten oil companies that decided to enter into the business reorganization law this shows that the future of these oil companies will be black and the stock market and the companies in the sector will be waiting for the development of their management in the coming weeksinvestigations into ecopetrol and petrotiger for alleged bribery are underway regarding this case the transparency secretariat assures that they had knowledge of the alleged payment of bribes by former directors of the foreign company petrotiger to ecopetrol officials at a meeting of the antibribery working group of the organization for economic cooperation and development  ocde for the moment the government has stated that progress is being made in the investigations both in the united states and in the country for its part ecopetrol has offered effective collaboration to facilitate the verification of the facts brought to the attention of the prosecutors office the collection of evidence and probative material in order to ensure the protection of the interests of the company and its shareholders the transparency secretariat pointed out that the investigations in the united states and in colombia are progressing in a coordinated manner and their results will be made public as soon as they are consolidatedecopetrol action did not suffer from corporate bribery scandal the revelation of a key witness who was collaborating with the fbi and the attorney generals office in the corruption scandal of ecopetrol and the firm petrotiger did not affect the behavior of the title on the colombian stock exchange the share price fell by   however around three in the afternoon ecopetrols share recovered with a value close to   that is a rise of  in the last week the market had stabilized thanks to the rise in crude prices even yesterday morning the stock of the oil company was marked by the wti whose price was rising more than  and was trading at an average of us   per barrel at noon the market reacted to the news of the complaint filed in a united states court for the payment of a bribe to assign a contract for us   million the market did not take with good eyes the news of the complaints of internal corruption but the fall was very slight nothing worrisome since in the afternoon hours it recovered by   a price lower than on friday when it closed at   said jose david lopez economic analyst at the stock exchange firm asesorias e inversiones the maximum of yesterday was at   and the minimum at   the share only had a negative variation of  yesterday at noon while the ecopetrol share has gained more than  so far in  what can be given is a piece of tranquility with the summary of yesterdays day the behavior was clearly expected by the news but the market responded positively by correcting the behavior of the title in time explained lopez alvaro yunes president of fendispetrol assured that corruption issues normally make the company lose the type of credibility that the company has likewise it can affect the value of the share with which it is traded on the stock market and with it the equity and what is contributed to the state through profits however the oil expert does not believe that it is an exaggerated punishment since the investigations that are already carried out by the united states authorities do not leave the oil company very well the case is also compared with what is happening in brazil where a corruption scandal at petrobras and the fall of the oil company had overflowed if that happened in brazil with the companys shares colombia could not be exempt from the situation much more if it is an investigation by the fbi which is also well advanced said yunes petrobras is involved in brazil in a millionaire diversion of money within the company for now experts assure that the issue of bribery will affect ecopetrols corporate governance but if it reaches favorable solutions for the state oil company confidence will return the opinion alvaro yunes president of fendispetrol corruption scandals can lose the companys credibility and affect the value at which the share is tradedthe candidate to steer ecopetrol in a month or so the firm that won the contest to choose the new president of ecopetrol must give the name of the selected executive the headhunter egon zender of jose fernando calderon risks his professional reputation since the headhunting he performs depends a large part on the future of the joint venture not only because it is the first company in colombia but one of the  oil companies most important in the world and on which a good part of the national budget depends bureaucratic appetites are huge the political pressures are inordinate and there is nothing more uncertain than the hydrocarbon business in the long term perhaps due to this very rarefied context the national government washed its hands and handed over said selection to a specialized firm after the names of maria lorena alvarez and juan carlos echeverry were disqualified by members of the board of directors for their no experience in the sector and in managing large corporations the minister of mines and energy tomas gonzalez knows about the issue and is aware of the importance of such a decision since the times when the presidency of ecopetrol was handed over under pressure from some senators with bureaucratic tentacles in barrancabermeja are over it is nothing but looking at the points on the companys agenda to realize that in the name to occupy the position you cannot improvise much less temporarily put a bureaucrat on duty and in the worst case unemployed ecopetrols new helmsman must start by handling the reputational crisis in which the company has been mired by the petrotiger case no less important are the actions that the company must take to find oil fields within or outside the country as well as weathering the lean cows in international prices that are opening a big hole in their finances there are many problems in the company that cannot be deepened by putting a former inexperienced official in the most important position every year ecopetrol turns over   billion to the national budget an amount that is compromised by the bad prices of crude oil but above all by the size of the company and all the work fronts that it has open returning to efficient ecopetrol is one of the most important tasks of the new ceo not everything is bad for the mixed state it is a company with global patents with international prestige with good results and managed by javier genaro gutierrez with a clean hand it is true that it is going through a very bad time but it is an important asset for the future of colombia hopefully the president who arrives knows how to move forward with ecopetrolecopetrol will maintain production of  barrels if the price is between us   and us   the most important oil company in the country is analyzing the cut in its budget daily this because the reductions in the reports depend on international crude prices which in the worst scenario that the company has analyzed would be below us   and at a minimum of us   however javier gutierrez pemberthy president of ecopetrol pointed out that if we have to reach more extreme cases we are prepared not to be suspended making cuts of an additional  the manager added that it is being very rigorous to spend what is necessary without leaving aside aspects that cannot be neglected such as safety to avoid accidents in the presentation that gutierrez made during the seminar of the national association of financial institutions anif and fedesarrollo he explained that to achieve the expected barrel production goal  barrels per day the company needs to minimize costs be rigorous with austerity review the portfolio of growth projects prioritize them based on value criteria and above all hope that a barrel of oil does not fall below us   if this happens ecopetrol will begin to reduce its production francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp explained that the rest of the production companies with operations in the country are also prepared for a crude price of us   and even minimums of us   regarding the investment plan of the state company gutierrez indicated that he will execute the no core asset sale plan that is the sale of the shares they have in empresa de energia de bogota eeb and in interconectado electrica sa isa  sergio clavijo president of anif pointed out that the situation in the sector is worrying since there are regions of the country where production is being suspended this is the case of putumayo where transportation costs are us   per barrel which makes it unprofitable to produce in the department given this gutierrez said that there have been ecopetrol suspensions since a large part of the crude oil was being removed via tank truck but also explained that the interconnections with the oil pipelines were put into operation which have facilitated the operation  it should not be forgotten that the suspension of operations in putumayo would occur under the price situation in the range of us   us   so if this does not happen production projects will have to be prioritized lloreda referred to the opportunity to produce offshore where there are benefits from the incorporation of the free zone law however the costs are much higher while producing onshore costs us   million offshore it is between us   and us   million government creates aid project for the oil sector after several meetings that the ministry of mines and energy has had with the sector to hear the requests of the oil tankers the vice minister of the portfolio carlos eraso pointed out that although they expect prices to be stabilize at us   per barrel this year the oil industry needs additional help where preferential royalty rates and adjustment flexibility are included in some contracts some of these are management only others such as the issue of preferences in royalty rates in incremental production projects and flexibility in the terms of the exploration evaluation and presentation of the commerciality declaration were presented in the development plan with this the government does not lower its production goal of  barrels for  the opinion francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association although the conditions to operate safety and licensing time improved this it is not enough and we are waiting for the plan to promote the sector ecopetrol obtains a loan for us   million for this years investment plan the operation was carried out with the participation of eight international banks jpmorgan chase bank na bnp paribas mizuho bank ltd bank of america na hsbc bank usa national association banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria grand cayman branch banco santander sa and citibank na the financing has a term of  years with amortization at maturity and interest payable semiannually at a libor rate   basis points which the company indicates are cost conditions substantially better than the equivalent of ecopetrol bonds maturing in  approximately  basis points less  the resources will be used to finance the investment plan and corporate purposes this international credit operation confirms confidence in our company and is a vote of confidence about the companys ability to face this international situation of lower oil prices said the president of ecopetrol javier gutierrezin a  alliance with anadarko ecopetrol begins new drilling thus it has already begun drilling three wells in the sea two in the colombian caribbean calasu and kronos and one more in the gulf of mexico in the united states the kronos well is located in the fuerte sur block and ecopetrol  and anadarko  participate in it the calasu well is located in the fuerte norte block and there too ecopetrol is associated in equal parts with anadarko finally in the gulf of mexico usa the sea eagle well will be drilled together with its partner murphy according to the company in  the offshore exploration activity of ecopetrol and the group companies resulted in three wells with the presence of hydrocarbons from eight drilled which meant a success rate of  of this exploratory activity those that registered the presence of hydrocarbons were rydberg shell  ecopetrol america  and nexen  and leon ecopetrol america  and repsol  meanwhile  petrobras  ecopetrol  and respol  became the first deepwater hydrocarbon discovery in the colombian caribbean this is the reason why several industry analysts believe that it is essential that the company does not reduce its efforts in the area of investment in exploration since only in this way will they generate increased production and reserves for the futurecreation of pipelines and production investments that must be prioritized by ecopetrol ecopetrol had already announced an investment plan for this year which amounted to us   million with significant resources for production with us   million and refining and petrochemicals with us   million however when the plan was carried out it was said that the money would be sought from different sources and one of them was financing either with credit or bonds thus yesterday the international banks jpmorgan chase bank bnp paribas mizuho bank bank of america hsbc bank usa national association banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria grand cayman branch banco santander and citibank financed the company with us   million with the purpose as reported by spokespersons for the oil company to prioritize investments related to production and corporate purposes because it is important to maintain the cash flow that will allow the company to have the resources to meet obligations such as tax payments royalties payroll payments among others  due to this the financial expert of the sector santiago suarez explained that the fact that this loan is going to be taken to cover cash flows at this time of bad prices does not look very good since it could be understood that the liquidity of the company is not the best and it is going to use the money to fill the gaps  additionally he explained that investments in transportation should be higher and a priority since the construction of oil pipelines causes costs to be reduced up to three times and there is more efficiency the financing has a term of five years and interest will be paid semiannually at a libor rate   basis points which are substantially better cost conditions than the equivalent of ecopetrols bonds maturing in  at about  basis points less for the president of the company javier gutierrez these credit conditions reflect that the company has qualification investment grade strong capacity to generate its own cash and ratify the confidence in the ability to face this international situation of lower oil prices  fields with higher investments the state company also announced that to achieve the  barrels per day on average expected for  the priority investments are for the castilla fields which produces more than  barrels of oil per day and the chichimene field with a production of more than  barrels per day additionally and despite the fact that this year the investment in offshore exploration will be us   million less ecopetrol will begin drilling three new deepwater wells two of these are in colombia calasu and kronos and another in the us sea eagle and in  they will reinforce their offshore exploratory campaign both in colombia and abroad in association with anadarko murphy shell nexen repsol and petrobras price of a barrel of brent rises to us   ecopetrols share closed yesterday at   with a growth of  one of the best days in recent months however this movement is part of the recent volatility in the price of oil the news yesterday is the rise in oil especially brent since colombia sells more indexed to this reference which a long time ago was not above us   said felipe campos director of research at alianza valores who adds that the increase in oil is due to the expectation and report of a greater weekly reduction in drilling rigs opinions javier gutierrez president of ecopetrol credit operation confirms confidence in our company and is a vote of confidence about the companys ability to face this situation of lower oil prices felipe campos research director at alianza valores the movement in the stock is part of the recent volatility in the price of oil it is a good recovery but it is still between   and   ecopetrols board of directors will remain the same and this week it would vote for the new president he stated that the government presented yesterday the plant of the board of directors of the company without any change the official said that this week the representative of the headhunting company egon zehnder will give the board of directors the names he has chosen for the management of the oil company although it is not known exactly when the vote will take place it is expected that this friday ecopetrol will already have a new representative finally in an interview with caracol radio cardenas commented on the probability that juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance is on the list of options but it is not known what other options the headhunter will present through a statement ecopetrol indicated that the plate proposed by the government will be put to the consideration of the shareholders meeting the plate sent by cardenas is made up of  tomas gonzalez minister of mines and energy  mauricio cardenas minister of finance  simon gaviria director of dnp  jorge pinzon sanchez independent  luis fernando ramirez acuna independent  joaquin moreno uribe independent  gonzalo restrepo lopez independent  horacio ferreira rueda representative of the producing departments  roberto steiner representative of the minority shareholdersguilds await a technical candidate for the head of ecopetrol based on this it is expected that at todays meeting or friday maximum the headhunting firm egon zehnder will present a list of around  resumes of candidates from around the world for the members of the board to begin to shorten the list and choose regarding the final decision cardenas explained that it is not certain that it will be taken definitively this week however he also pointed out on caracol radio the possibility that juan carlos echeverry former minister of the same portfolio is among the most optioned this being the case the same names are still being heard in the deck for the presidency since the headhunting firm has been very cautious with the preliminary list which is made based on the profile required by the companys top leadership according to camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones this profile is purely technical since ecopetrol urges a president with greater knowledge in exploration and exploitation of mature fields since the economic part can be handled by the board of directors similarly hernando barrero executive director of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet stated that the best candidate is one who has professional experience in the oil sector great business management and additionally human attitudes so that he has a good acceptance by both workers and the environment some candidates juan carlos echeverry is the name that has had the most force in recent months however among the experts in the mining and energy sector whom lr consulted technical knowledge is lacking as they explain despite the fact that he is an excellent financial professional and his time as minister of finance gives him great value he has no knowledge in the area of oil in addition within the workers and unions he is considered a very political candidate so that despite being a brilliant economist this would generate discomfort in the company besides the fact of having been an advisor to interbolsa  commented guillermo sinisterra professor and economist at the javeriana university camilo marulanda lopez for his part was the one that most liked among the experts since he knows the technical part and as operations manager of the oil company earns several points it is also attributed as explained by angel arce an analyst of the sector that being inside the company knowing its vision mission short medium and longterm projections and having discussed the issue with the current president javier gutierrez  it gives him a great advantage over the other candidates  that is why sinisterra believes that it is whoever owns the company who knows what is right and what is wrong and is in charge of a very important area of the company which makes it the strongest however he also has several opponents since according to edwin castano national president of the union sindical obrera uso he is very young and has not shown that he has management of the company we are also investigating a purchase he made in the united states on land that is in trouble today so i would not start on the right foot finally there is which many consider the most political quota maria lorena gutierrez minister counselor of the government for his part despite the fact that experts recognize his studies industrial engineering from the universidad de los andes with an mba and a doctorate in finance from the university of tulane he is considered very close to political interests and with zero experience in the sector this being the case things are not easy since it must not be forgotten that for example federico rengifo former minister of mines had also been heard but fabio echeverry generated great opposition and the appointment was not achieved the new leader at the head of the largest company in the country will not only have to deal with the crisis in the price of a barrel of crude oil but also the scandal of bribery within the company that has hit ecopetrols reputation juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance in the government of president juan manuel santos is an economist at the universidad de los andes where he has also been a professor and dean of the faculty of economics he has a phd in economics from new york university echeverry has been a member of the board of directors of mazda a company of market experts mx and the empresa de energia de bogota he owns the consulting firm econcept was director of macroeconomic and inflation programming at banco de la republica and director of the national planning department camilo marulanda this  economist is a graduate of the universidad de los andes and has had an upward career at ecopetrol he was president of cenit the largest subsidiary of the state oil company with   billion in assets that is dedicated to managing its old pipelines and multiple pipelines marulanda lopez also worked at procter  gamble colombia and since  held the positions of head of the marketing department manager of national marketing and vice president of supply and marketing at ecopetrol roberto steiner sampedro economist from the universidad de los andes with doctorates from columbia university he was director of the research department of the banco de la republica director of the center for studies on economic development at universidad de los andes executive director at the imf and fedesarrollo steiner has been a consultant for the idb imf eclac and the world bank he was a member of the board of directors of the bogota stock exchange and is currently a member of the boards of directors of ecopetrol and bancolombia and of the board of directors of the national infrastructure agency presidency has more candidates and more time despite doubts about transparency in the process the country hopes that the headhunting firm is choosing the best candidate and some experts add to the list the name of alberto calderon zuleta who knows the sector he was president of ecopetrol and is in the miningenergy union  explained edwin castano it has also been heard that the head hunter firm has studied the resumes of roberto junguito jr armando montenegro felipe posada bernardo ortiz bravo and mauricio echeverry finally jose manuel restrepo rector of rosario said that they are all good candidates with international projection and vision and able to overcome the moment  so perhaps the process takes longer than expected in the analysis of the board of directors opinions edwin castano national president of the uso marulanda is a very young man and does not manage the company echeverry and gutierrez are very political  angel arce specialist in the miningenergy sector echeverry is excellent in finances and his time as a minister gives him great value but he knows little about the technicalwill the more than   million ecopetrol invested in headhunting be lost it is for this reason that the central criticism that arises to the state is whether the board of directors wasted a large amount of money for a process that was not needed the amount of how much this hiring cost is not precisely known however in a survey carried out by lr with some headhunting companies that participated in the call for the oil company and others in the sector it is believed that the search for which he was paid egon zehnder could be between   million which is  of the annual salary of what the president of the company will earn on average up to   million which would be what he would have been charged for being a firm of the character of ecopetrol under this panorama the second criticism that ecopetrol receives by some political sectors is whether the fact that a large part of the board is highly linked to the government means that decisions are finally made by finger and by political affiliations and they criticize at the same time that the name that continues to appear in all the headlines is that of juan carlos echeverry former minister of finance of the current government who would also have the three votes of the government plus those of luis fernando ramirez roberto steiner and joaquin brown that is why ivan duque senator of the democratic center comments that the president of ecopetrol is expected to have an impeccable track record an excellent resume and above all extensive managerial experience in the sector not a post from the ministry of finance  not forgetting that former minister echeverry was an advisor to interbolsa and his firm econcept also advised saludcoop finally former minister amylkar acosta comments that this would not necessarily mean that the headhunters money would be lost since it is good to connect the dots regarding how the process has been carried out if in fact the board of directors had wanted to choose echeverry from the beginning it would not have had to hire the firm since it has all the authority on the other hand he recalls the support that the government gave to the board of directors on tuesday with which some would conclude that if he wanted to put his hand on the matter he would have taken some names off the list experts provide alternatives for the process other specialists in the sector such as julio cesar vera former director of hydrocarbons at the ministry of mines agree that at this time it would be detrimental even for the country if the best option were not chosen and he adds that the best that could turn out is that a real oilman is chosen rather than a great professional for his part the senator of the democratic center ivan duque believes that in the future they should be analyzed as the oecd recommended that the election process for the president of ecopetrol be open participatory and meritocratic in addition the boards of directors should be changed since there are ministers who play a double role opinions ivan duque senador democratic center the president of ecopetrol is expected to have an impeccable track record and above all a broad managerial experience in the sector not to be a minhacienda courier julio cesar vera industry expert i dont think ecopetrol would have made a farce of that size but rather that it is actually a serious objective and above all technical processecopetrols crude oil reserves grew  in  on the other hand the reserve replacement index for  was  higher than the  registered in  in other words for each barrel produced the company added  barrels in proven reserves and in the last five years it has increased its net reserves  and reached a replacement rate of  on average thus by the end of  the company had  million barrels equivalent of proven reserves this is largely due to the increased investment in exploration that the company took place last year of the total incorporations that occurred  is oil and  is gasecopetrols good exploration investment program increased its reserves by  the exploration activity of the oil company the previous year included acquisitions of seismic programs for  kilometers geology and geophysics studies regional studies and others associated with the viability of the projects for us   million which resulted in the replacement index reserves is now  that is to say that for each barrel produced  barrels of proved reserves were incorporated within the companys balance of added reserves  is oil and  is gas this is proven by the thesis of several industry analysts who affirm that this year with the decrease in investment the figures will not be the sameecopetrol is close to electing the next president from two candidates the board of directors of the state oil company could elect the new ceo at a meeting this week said the person who asked not to be named because the matter is not public the person declined to name the other candidate ecopetrol declined to comment on the boards ceo decision and echeverry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment the company said in december it was looking for a new president to replace javier gutierrez who has led the company since  production has declined amid local protests and guerrilla attacks on pipelines average production in the third quarter fell  to the equivalent of  barrels per day compared to the previous yearecopetrol will report its results for the previous year on march  ecopetrol is the largest company in colombia and one of the most traded stocks in the region the companys data is key to determining the impact of crude prices on the countrys tax revenue taking into account that the government owns  percent of the oil company ecopetrol announced in december a  percent cut in its investment plan for  to   billion as a result of its lower profits at the cut of the third quarter of last yearstandard  poors maintains the international rating of ecopetrol sa in its report the rating agency highlights the leading position of ecopetrol sa in colombia its role in the colombian economy and the consideration of a high probability of timely and sufficient support for the company by its main shareholder the government of colombiaecopetrols profit was down  at the end of last year total sales reached   billion representing a reduction of  compared to that reported at the end of  when they were   billion likewise operating profit decreased  from   trillion to   trillion on the ebitda side the drop was  going from   billion to   billion all this for unconsolidated results in terms of consolidated results the company also reported a  reduction in its total sales which went from   billion to   billion and operating profit contracted  ending at   billion in  compared to the   trillion it had reached in  the average sale price of ecopetrols basket of crude oil gas and products was us    bl lower than the levels of  which in combination with a devaluation of  in the average exchange rate had a significant impact on our financial results it is important to mention that the devaluation of the exchange rate has two effects of different nature on the financial results of the company on the operational side a higher exchange rate benefits us since  of our sales are denominated in dollars even though we also make purchases of raw materials in that currency but in a lower percentage on the other hand we suffer negative impacts on nonoperating income  expenses every time the rate is devalued as a result of the restatement of our foreign debt to colombian pesos  explained the president of the company javier gutierrez but despite the downward results gutierrez highlighted that the company obtained discoveries in offshore exploration grounds strengthened the transportation division seeking to be more competitive with margins and generated positive ebitda for refinancing additionally they entered the final stretch of the expansion of the cartagena refinery the investment in its presentation of results the company highlighted that the investment plan for this year is us   million and that this is in line with the situation of prices and low returns in the sector they pointed out that this is in line with the strategy of value generation and the focus on production they also indicated that along the same lines they have started a plan to optimize costs and expenses to generate structural savings and economies of scale to face this era of low oil prices which they expect will also hit the financial results of this year corruption scandals regarding the most recent corruption scandals that have affected the company they indicated that they have a policy of zero tolerance for corruption which is why the corresponding complaints have been made to the competent authorities in recent years ecopetrol has focused on strengthening its internal control system of which the ethics and compliance office is a part to prevent detect and punish inappropriate behaviors that violate ethics and corporate governance the board of directors senior management and in general all ecopetrol officials are committed to the frontal fight against corruption  gutierrez concluded in the communication issued through the financial superintendence of colombia william salazar an economics analyst assured that ecopetrols outlook is relatively serious in terms of profits and for the country as well if one takes into account that the company has the largest contribution in revenue to the country the deficit is going to be more delicate than what the government had proposed i dont think the price of oil is going to pick up so that percentage of net income would be lost at the end of the year and the country would face a deficit of about   billion  the expert also explained that the deficit will not be able to be covered if the cut of   billion in the budget and   billion more from the tax reform are taken into account there will be no weight for the postconflict in the coming years the heaviest burden could be borne by the middle class ecopetrol proposes an ordinary dividend of   per share the petroleum board of directors proposes to distribute  of the net profit as an ordinary dividend in that way it would amount to   per share the company does not specify the number of installments in which it will be distributed as it will be decided at the assembly ecopetrols share fell  in the bvc ecopetrols share was the one that fell the most in the colombian stock exchange bvc after presenting its financial results for last year in which it was shown that net profits were they decreased  compared to what was reported in  with a total of   billion the title of the oil company had a negative variation of  and closed at   in addition it was the most traded share during the day with   million according to analysts this devaluation is mainly due to the companys financial results which were below market expectations the profits were quite discouraging the market expected   billion and they came out at   billion so the surprise was quite high the drop was  compared to the previous year explained izhak kempowsky economic analyst of stocks and values experts agree that this negative variation in the stock is marked by the volatility of oil prices that has been seen in recent days according to what was reported by ecopetrol to the superfinanciera the total sales of the oil company reached   billion representing a reduction of  compared to what was reported at the end of  when they were   billion likewise operating profit decreased  from   trillion to   trillion on the ebitda side the drop was  going from   billion to   billion all this for unconsolidated resultsecopetrol will not be privatized nor will unjustified dismissals be approved garzon to stop the announced strike the minister of labor luis eduardo garzon met with the representatives of the union sindical obrera uso to try to find a way out of the crisis in the sector the worst that can happen in this stage is a strike at a time where by promoting employment we end up generating a terrible situation because if production is lowered programs such as familias en accion colombia mayor victim programs because that is financed are affected of oil production said minister garzon for this reason during the meeting the head of the labor ministry responded to the requests of the unions where the two main concerns have to do with an alleged intention of the government to privatize the state oil company ecopetrol according to edwin castano president of the use and the nonrenewal of contracts in the sector in front of ecopetrol minister garzon denied that the government had any intention of privatizing the company and affirmed that a dialogue table will be established to analyze the future of the oil company in conjunction with the ministry of finance and mines and energy and the national department of planning we agree that next week with people from planning finance mines and ourselves we are going to talk with them about where ecopetrol is going they start from the assumption that it is going to be privatized and i have promised to make a defense of the company itself and i think the government is in the same vein said garzon regarding the labor issue the representative of the uso assures that due to the crisis in the sector  contracts have stopped being renewed and that this figure could reach  by the end of the year for which he asked the government for guarantees but minister garzon was emphatic in assuring that it has to be very justified for the portfolio to approve massive cuts because this ministry is not made to promote layoffs if there is a circumstance that shows us that it is inevitable inexorable we look at it but that is not the line of the ministry or the government  however garzon said that due to the fact that the ministry refuses the possibility of massive layoffs we are in a situation that we cannot hide if there are companies that are leaving because the large multinationals do not pay them or because they have extremely high accruals or because they no longer find a fertile stage to develop their production  there are many companies that are small and mediumsized that are obviously looking for the easiest way out which is to terminate the contract i dont continue working here and i take my frets elsewhere there is an attitude of going through the back door i leave i terminate contracts and i do not continue to employ people he said however the senior official indicated that the ministry will continue to work together with companies in the sector and for this he appointed the vice minister of labor relations enrique borda to analyze the situation with the colombian petroleum institute where there are  outsourced workers in the last  years and today it is said that  have to come out and to see to what extent there is justice or not on these issues he explained while the government is committed to the workers the board of directors of the uso will meet tomorrow wednesday to decide whether or not to enter into a cessation of activitiescartagena refinery would start operations in the second half of  says ecopetrol the cartagena refinery reficar modernization project with investments exceeding us   million is more than  complete said pedro rosales ecopetrols executive vice president of refining the refinery would start operations during the second half of  rosales said in a conference call in which the company presented its financial results for  reficar with  units and located on the caribbean sea is key for ecopetrol to achieve the goal of increasing its total refining capacity to  barrels per day once the modernization project is completed the refinery will have a loading capacity of  barrels per day up from  barrels per day in the past with the entry into operation of reficar we would have the capacity to produce all the fuels that the country requires domestically rosales said revealing that  barrels of diesel per day and lower volumes of gasoline would stop being imported the main refinery in colombia is barrancabermeja located in the department of santander which has a production capacity of  barrels per dayecopetrol needs a ceo who knows ecopetrols figures speak for themselves a  drop in net income decrease in consolidated profits during  of   billion losses during the last quarter of last year of us   million  drop in earnings  decrease in revenues and an average production of  barrels that is  barrels less than in  the situation is the worst in many years since the state oil company was listed on the colombian stock exchange the situation that has a lot to do with the international oil scene sadly dismisses javier genaro gutierrez pemberthy a highprofile executive who had known how to lead ecopetrol as the countrys flagship company it is a sad goodbye that is not fair with the work undertaken for several years by the senior executive the low production for example had to do with environmental restrictions and problems with the communities that stopped the production of  barrels per day without counting the subsidiaries production was  barrels a day a strong reduction compared to the previous year when  barrels were extracted in  ecopetrols crude oil basket was sold at us   per barrel while in  it was us   per barrel this will be the scenario that the new president of ecopetrol will have to face in the coming months low prices corruption problems loss of competitiveness and above all the responsibility to remain the goose that lays the golden eggs of the colombian economy it is not enough to emphasize that the national budget depends on about   billion of transfers from the state to the government coffers there is already a cost and expense optimization plan put in place by gutierrez in an attempt to achieve structural savings and economies of scale that allow it to operate profitably under low price scenarios which will continue to affect financial results during  the firm hunts talents egon zeder gave the board of directors the evaluation of the candidates evaluated but it is the members of the board of directors who represent the president who risk their prestige when deciding who will be the new ceo of ecopetrol hopefully they will lean towards an executive who has a lot of experience in managing multinational companies since the state company has a presence in several countries it is listed on the wall street and toronto stock exchanges and you must know the ins and outs of the oil business president santos is playing a valuable card with this appointment that can break the history of the state if there is a bad election the consequences will be very seriousecopetrols financial figures in  hurt on the stock markets this title from january  to yesterday has presented a negative variation of  in the local market while so far in  its devaluation has been  in new york the behavior of the stock has also been negative since from the first month of the previous year until yesterday it had fallen  and during   in toronto so far this year the stock has presented a  fall while from january  until yesterday its variation was also negative and stood at  according to experts ecopetrol in previous years it had not presented negative quarters which implies that the stocks fall is even stronger alejandro reyes director of economic research at ultraburstiles affirmed that the movement of the stock is pressured downwards by the companys costs and by the price of crude oil that closed yesterday at us   rising  what is striking were the high financial costs that the oil company had last year which are associated with ecopetrols debt and what has to reappreciate every quarter at the close of the exchange rate it is important to bear in mind that the impact was quite large between september and the end of december of last year explained reyes for his part izhak kempowsky economic analyst for stocks and securities said that the profits were discouraging the market expected   billion and they came out at   billion so the surprise was quite high the fall was  compared to the previous year  it is important to analyze that since march  this title began to lose value in its price since on the  of that month the share was at   while if we compare that value with that of october  of that same year this already it reached   that is it presented a devaluation of  on the other hand analysts agree that the market should also be prepared so that the results presented by ecopetrol referring to the first quarter of this year are more unfavorable than those of the fourth quarter and those accumulated in  how were the figures  according to what was reported by ecopetrol last monday to the financial superintendency of colombia net profits fell  compared to what was reported in  with a total of   billion total sales of the oil company reached   billion representing a reduction of  compared to the end of the immediately previous year when they were   billion operating profit decreased  from   billion to   billion on the ebitda side the drop was  from   billion to   billion taking this report into account and knowing that the government is dependent on oil revenues mostly from ecopetrol global securities analysts estimate that there would be financing needs of   trillion javier gutierrez president of the company through a video call assured that lower production and growth in costs and expenses were what reduced financial results in  as he stated that the fourth quarter of the previous year was

purchase of contracts with this scenario according to luis ernesto mejia former minister of mines he will have to face several challenges among the main ones are preparing the company for a scenario of low oil prices and working on the operational efficiency of the company with that scenario in addition it will have to move ecopetrol from being a contract administrator to an oil and gas explorer and producer that it is efficient in the exploitation of oil barrels he must also organize a work team that has a good experience  on the other hand edwin castano president of the union sindical obrera uso said that from his point of view echeverry will have to face the termination of the campo rubiales contract for ecopetrol buy back the shares of minority shareholders so that they can return to be  stateowned complete the barrancabermeja refinery modernization project that will bring environmental economic and social benefits to the region and the country in addition it should consider the entry of the company into the retail distribution of fuels and lubricants and the direct operation of the fields that are delivered under delegated administration finally it should end labor outsourcing at ecopetrol since today there are about  contractors  finally alvaro yunes president of fedispetrol told lr that echeverry is a man who is knowledgeable about finances i dont think i have an experience in the sector but it can be learned i am concerned that in these country circumstances suddenly it is not the most suitable to direct the destinies of ecopetrol  this was the selection process for the collection of resumes and qualification of the candidates aptitudes among which camilo marulanda and roberto steiner sampedro also sounded strong the oil company hired a headhunter egon zehnder who carried out a process that it is estimated that it was priced between   million and   million hernando barrero executive director of acipet said that we consider that the process that was carried out for the selection had its foundation and several candidates were recommended and the board with its best criteria selected who they considered had the best profile and the indicated trajectory to to replace gutierrez who left the goal quite high in the company  camilo marulanda will accompany echeverry from the vicepresidency the company also announced that the economist camilo marulanda is the vicepresidential formula that will work hand in hand with echeverry like the president the executive who has been linked to ecopetrol since  is an economist from the universidad de los andes and has a specialization in markets and an mba from the same university in his resume he records work experience at internationa investment intelligence and at procter  gamble opinions alvaro yunes president of fedispretol i cannot refer either well or badly to the former minister he is a man who is knowledgeable about finances i dont think i have an experience in the sector but it can be learned  luis ernesto mejia former minister of mines he has very important credentials he underwent a selection process and he won it surely he does not have all the knowledge in the sector but what he lacks he will acquire the ecopetrol board decided on youth and experience campetrol for the union manager ecopetrols board of directors sent the country a clear message that the company wants renewed blood as well as a new vision the oil company recognizes in echeverry the macroeconomic knowledge and in marulanda its experience in the sector thanks to  years of service to the company between the two they can give a very special dynamic to the immense challenges that ecopetrol has in the future said lizarralde  he added that it is necessary for the president of the company to make quick decisions due to the current situation in the sector while saying that we hope that with the board of directors and the government they will take action as soon as possible on whether the rubiales concession is renewed or not to pacific he assured that this decision is important since the regions and the country need clear and timely information in this regard because we are extremely concerned about what we begin to feel in the areas of activity in relation to the providers that provide services to this company he also pointed out that it is important for echeverry to change the tone in relation to the budget issue as this has been substantially reduced for oil exploration and if we lower investment for this activity we will most likely import crude oil in about six or seven years said the leader in this sense the president of campetrol indicated that today is when all the activities of the chain such as seismic drilling and exploration should be encouraged the most since crude prices are already taking their toll on the national economy colombian exports fell  in the first month of the year it is the worst collapse since september  when they fell  for this reason i call for the new president of ecopetrol to encourage the hydrocarbon industry which contributes  of foreign sales and  of the nations tax revenue  he pointed out he explained that although the industry is not going through one of its best moments this is not dramatic that is why the situation should not be overestimated from  to  we had an average price of a barrel of us   a time when the sector was dynamic from  to date the average was us   today we are at us   therefore ecopetrol must analyze in fact what are the real problems that are definitely affecting the industry and its costs there we also need quick decisions  he concludedthe advice that the experts give juan carlos echeverry for ecopetrol and is that echeverrys headaches appear at a time when the price of crude fluctuates between us   and us   per barrel profit losses of     million in the fourth quarter of  the goal production that fell over  barrels per day an imminent strike and internal problems this is not to mention that the share price continues to fall yesterday the title closed with a variation of  in the colombian stock exchange  in the new york and  in the toronto one however echeverry has not been the only president to take office in lean times so there are business lessons you can take into account andres restrepo londono juan maria rendon luis bernardo florez antonio jose urdinola and isaac yanovich are part of the last  ecopetrol presidents who had to assume with low prices up to us   per barrel and created different strategies to remove float the company among the advice and lessons the plans to support the development of the natural gas market and to establish the export power of hydrocarbons as well as the extension of the gas pipeline network in the country stand out this according to experts will be one of the tasks of the new president for the company to go from being a contract administrator to an oil and gas explorer and producer additionally hernando barrero executive director of acipet advised that ecopetrol should discard the idea of selling its stakes in firms such as isa and eeb and focus on diversifying its portfolio andres duarte director of equities at corficolombiana said that the oil companys share in colombia still does not have a strong base since the company has not announced its medium or longterm management plan and only announced its investment strategies for  it plans to cut a spending of us   million and the approval of us   million and is that although sources told lr that ecopetrol had already shown it internally since last december that is another of the advice left by former presidents such as florez who drew up a roadmap to calculate the impact of their profitability goals former director alberto calderon emphasized his management in international promotion and association contracts luis ernesto mejia former minister of mines and energy advised that this is one of the axes on which they will have to focus since greater openness to possible partnerships with foreign firms especially in technology could bring developments in unconventional fields and reduction of operational costs bruce mac master president of andi advised that this year reficar should go into operation to ease the industry vice president marulanda one of the strategies of former ecopetrol president luis bernardo florez was to make an organizational change and deliver management capabilities to the vice presidents this after the announcement that camilo marulanda who was among the candidates for the presidency will serve in the position complies with the advice given by guillermo sinisterra professor and economist at the javeriana university who said that he has the responsibility company in the head and knows what is right opinions luis ernesto mejia former minister of mines and energy they must understand that a greater openness to possible associations with investors will bring cost reduction and optimization of crude oil hernando barrero executive director of acipet ecopetrol has to maintain the diversification of its portfolio it should not focus only on producing oil at the current pricejuan carlos echeverry is preparing to start work at ecopetrol the new president pledged to exceed targets for oil exploration and exploitation it is an honor and a responsibility accepting it contains the commitment to lead the thousands of workers and officials of the most beloved company of colombians to forge a great future together  echeverry was emphatic that during his tenure he will seek the best rates of return for the companys shareholders and the country in general within the framework of a transparent comprehensive and effective work always efficiently and adjusting costs to international standards i express my greatest feeling of respect and admiration for dr javier gutierrez president of the company for the last seven years who directed it with wisdom vision and determination as a colombian and as a professional i thank you and acknowledge the fundamental transformation of ecopetrol echeverry said in a statement the new management seeks to increase the quality and quantity of the elite exploration team to achieve the goals of oil and gas production in turn he pledged to do what is in his power to redrive the sector after the situation it is going

victim in the case with ecopetrol additionally the company recalled that this matter was discovered thanks to complaints made by the firm in  and that almost a year ago on may   the us courts exonerated it of all responsibility in the facts in this way petrotiger indicated that this recognition by the justice of both countries confirms the good conduct of petrotiger its board of directors and its current administration which immediately denounced the irregularities separated the directors from their positions and more of  people from his circle of trust and they gave full collaboration with the investigations to clarify the facts  finally the company welcomed the progress in this case at the prosecutors office and highlighted the request that the presidency made to all businessmen to report illicit conduct in their companies and strengthen their management against fraud and acts of corruptionto jail a former ecopetrol official for bribing petrotiger the investigation refers to events that occurred in the second half of  when urueta would have issued concepts as a production engineer at ecopetrol that favored the hiring of the multinational petrotiger for which he received about   million it recommended additions of works to induce hiring that ultimately favored the interest of individuals noted the prosecutor in the case who also pointed out that illegal payments were made by the multinational that they generated in this kind of investigation the investigating entity insisted that it is a public servant who accepted money on his behalf or from a third party failing to perform his duties which would make him responsible for the conduct of his own bribery as for the prevaricate it is his responsibility in the issuance of concepts to favor private interests to obtain money that unjustifiably increased his assets for which he was charged with the crime of illicit enrichment in favor of individuals urueta martinez  was at the disposal of the national penitentiary and prison institute inpececopetrol will not extend the campo rubiales exploration contract to pacific pacific said they had planned this decision so they will continue working on the  blocks it has in the country in the next  months ecopetrol also said that it will evaluate different alternatives for the operation of the rubiales field this means for pacific a third of its production and  of its reserves the parties reported in a joint statement that ecopetrol and pacific rubiales energy report that they have agreed not to extend the participation contracts of riesgo rubiales and asociacion piriri that expire in june  ecopetrol will evaluate different alternatives for the operation of the rubiales field  for its part pacific rubiales energy will study the possibility of submitting a proposal to operate this asset  the companies express their interest in continuing to develop business opportunities for the benefit of both parties and the country the statement said the announcement came after the ecopetrol board of directors meeting where the final review and analysis of a technical report was given therefore since july  ecopetrol will follow the gross production of  barrels per day which according to the figures of the state oil company is the highest production of the fields in the country with the announcement pacific will only maintain management of the quifa field from june of next year located in puerto gaitan meta which has a production of  thousand barrels per day in this same sector is campo rubiales the company will maintain its participation with  more fields in the country according to industry calculations from july  the canadian companys production will be  lower and its reserves will be reduced by  rubiales produces around  barrels a dayecopetrol shares will not see a rebound and pacific shares will have additional losses analysts expect that ecopetrols share will open the day today with very slight rallies since for them the projections of production and reserves in the largest field in the country which produces  barrels per day on average were already within the expectations for ecopetrol although the news is positive because it gives greater certainty in the increase in production in  those reserves of campo rubiales were already on the balance sheets so there would not be a significant boost to the title said andres rosas  global securities stock analyst felipe campos director of economic research at alianza valores agrees with this opinion in the balance sheets in the projections and valuations of the company the majority of analysts knew that rubiales was leaving the administration of pacific the benefit that ecopetrol could have was already taken into account by investors  regarding the behavior that the pacific rubiales share will have analysts expect the blow to be harder for it rosas explained that the market had been monitoring the action of the second most important company in the oil sector but with uncertainty about the extension of this contract in pacific there will be a negative behavior of the stock already with the official statement that the contract is no more it would give for there to be an additional decline the expert assured that the behavior of the title in colombia like that of canada always go hand in hand but with respect to the news of the end of the contract the local action will have a stronger blow we would expect a greater discount in colombia than in canada because here the news was not felt so much at the end of friday the shares of both companies so far this year have had falls ecopetrol with a decrease of  and pacific rubiales ecopetrol completes construction of the paramo plant the renewed plant increases the transport capacity of the aforementioned pipeline improves the companys capacity to transport about  barrels per day and benefits the prospects of the oil company since with this implementation it begins to lower its cost scheme which at the moment is so necessary the construction and startup of this plant which had been destroyed in  by a terrorist attack took place between november  and december  during which time  manhours were invested according to the oil company the development of this project was a challenge for the work team due to the irregularities of the terrain for transporting the machinery as well as the low temperatures that reach three degrees celsius and the difficult weather conditions in the area  additionally they point out that for the mobilization of the pumping units and the passage of the trucks it was necessary to reinforce and improve the load capacity of two bridges that are close to the plant guaitara and chamuz in the municipality of puerres therefore the company also explained that resources of   billion were allocated for the rehabilitation and improvement of the access roads between san juan puerres and monopamba all located in the surroundings of the new infrastructure of the company likewise and thanks to the need for reactivation and the time in which the plant had to be completed the stateowned company indicates that employment was created for hundreds of people from the surrounding communities according to the company  local labor quotas were delivered benefiting the same number of families due to staff turnover from the entrance of the plant the operation will now be  hours a day like the other plants of the trasandino pipeline which has a length of  kilometers for the transportation of oil from orito putumayo to the tumaco maritime terminal in this way the company continues to improve the projects with which it had already acquired commitments and which likewise improve the companys costs and profits to understand the importance of the new plant that comes into operation it can be compared with the production of campos like castilla one of the largest in the company and which produces about  average barrels of oil per day cartagena refinery will start this year the cartagena refinery reficar would come into operation in the second half of  which would allow ecopetrol to meet the internal demand for fuels and suspend imports of diesel and gasoline with this it is expected and the additions that are being made until  it is expected that the company will continue to improve the figures that have been affected by the fall of more than  in oil pricesdevelopment plan does not privatize ecopetrol says simon gaviria additionally gaviria stated that the works for the modernization of the barrancabermeja refinery are contemplated in the initiative the uso leaders did not give statements after the meeting but they assured that they will discuss the matter in the afternoonecopetrols production exceeded  barrels per day in january and february  during the first two months of  ecopetrols production not including those of the group companies remained above  barrels of oil equivalent boe  a result that according to the company is mainly explained by the record productions in fields such as castilla and chichimene located in the department of meta and in the la cira infantas field in magdalena medio in january average production was  boed while in february it was  boped with which the company manages to exceed the goal that had been set for this period of  boped in addition the result represents an increase of  thousand barrels per day compared to the average recorded in  of  boped on the other hand the company reported that of the volumes produced in the first two months of the year  was contributed by the orinoquia regional vice presidency which groups the meta and casanare fields  by the central regional vice presidency which brings together the magdalena medio and catatumbo fields  by the south regional vice presidency which concentrates the huila tolima and putumayo fields and the remaining  by the vice presidency of assets with partners which includes assets operated by associates in which ecopetrol has a stake  in addition to the aforementioned fields ecopetrol also highlights the growth in the cantagallo and casabe del magdalena medio fields which together reported a growth of  bopedecopetrol exceeded  barrels per day in the first two months in january the average production was  boed while in february it was  boped this production also manages to exceed the goal that the company had set for this period of  bored and represents an increase of  barrels per day compared to the average recorded in  of  boped additionally another factor that has influenced the results is the increase in production in the chichemene field directly operated by ecopetrol where a record production of  bpd was achieved in january there are currently stable productions around  bpd finally the company reported that of the volumes produced in the first two months of the year  were contributed by the orinoquia regional vice presidency which groups the meta and casanare fields  by the central regional vice presidency which brings together the magdalena medio and catatumbo fields  for the south regional vice presidency which concentrates the huila tolima and putumayo fields and the remaining  by the vice presidency of assets with partners which includes assets operated by associates in which ecopetrol has a stakeecopetrols assembly approves a dividend per share of   and the payment will be in june among the reports that were presented during the assembly it was pointed out that people who bought in the first round of  at   per share have received   per share in  including   this year before the vote the outgoing president of the oil company javier genaro gutierrez said that for this year the company will not reduce production so the goal will be  barrels he said they cut our revenues in half for the oil companies and we have to continue operating said gutierrez adding that last year  barrels of oil a day stopped being produced for reasons external to ecopetrol the meeting began this morning with the intervention of the minister of mines and energy tomas gonzalez estrada at the corferias facilities in bogota who assured that it has been possible to maintain oil production over five months above one million barrels per day we have to keep that production to the maximum he said gonzalez estrada also pointed out that thanks to the efforts made by the company the largest gas discovery in the colombian caribbean was achieved last yearthe rubiales field will increase ecopetrols production by  as of  gutierrez also reassured the shareholders about the decision not to extend the exploitation contract of the rubiales and piriri fields to pacific from july   and clarified that already there is no possibility that another company will take ownership of the barrels the only thing that is being analyzed is that a fee is paid to a company for the operation with regard to the decline of the field which according to a report by the national hydrocarbons agency anh on february  the average production in  fell by  to  barrels per day it indicated that there are fields where the recovery factor it has reached  so the company is studying with these technologies to maintain production in the field and also implement other technology in the future to increase the factor to  and finally extract the maximum that rubiales can give additionally the manager pointed out that the board of directors is still studying who will be in charge of the operation of the field and that this decision is already in the hands of the successor juan carlos echeverry the latter should take into account that the company has not decreased investments in  pilot projects that will allow increasing the companys total recovery factor from  to  by  this means that with an increase of  in the recovery factor would generate an additional  million barrels and by  an additional  million barrels would be expected on the other hand jose francisco arata president of pacific rubiales pointed out that the benefits that the field would have if the operation with the canadian company continues would be among others a higher recovery factor between  and  based on the extractions that are have been made in venezuela and taking into account that the company specializes in heavy crude to finish the topic of the field the president of the company noted that it is investing in eight new pilot projects to improve the extraction of crude oil since the main function of the company at present is to strengthen exploration and production to continue obtaining above of  barrels per day  production and which in turn was the second largest production in history the potential for its part will be in the fields of the llanos that is in chichimene which has  barrels a day of oil and castilla with  bdp the reduction of expenses on the other hand and despite the fact that the budget adjusted to the price levels that contemplates investments for  for us   trillion  less than the one approved in  and the reduction plan of costs and operating expenses for us   million the company indicated that the reduction of operating and administration expenses will be made in crude oil purchases of  diluent purchases in  subsoil maintenance in   operating and administrative expenses  association services  and others  it was also highlighted that since last year the company undertook the cost optimization plan a reduction of   million in the budget has been achieved among the other austerity measures that have been adopted are restrictions on travel per diem advertising sponsorships service contracts have been renegotiated drilling civil works and there are other optimization initiatives in the processes of purchasing goods and services additionally there are other measures taking into account that prices have not stabilized with reduction of fixed costs and expenses of up to  and revision of commercial strategies with optimization of up to  the assembly also discussed various points on which minority shareholders had opinions such as the construction of the barrancabermeja refinery the second and third phases of the bicentenario pipeline and the fall in the companys share from about   to   before that the price of oil fell  respect for barrancabermeja pedro rosales vice president of refining the company pointed out that it is a project of great dimension in which ecopetrol proposes that it be done in the most appropriate way so that up to now there are advances in engineering and adaptation of activities but the investment decision due to the great magnitude of the investment it demands has to be postponed since the first need is to have cartagena operating to ensure that the human resource is available in addition in the current need of the company it is necessary to look at the return on investment so now efforts are used to have cash that is why the refinery is a great investment but it takes time to pay off secondly compared to the second and third phases of the bicentennial pipeline gutierrez pointed out that the delivery for  of the first phase has already been completed which was the stipulated one and that the second and third are still being analyzed finally compared to the fall in the share that yesterday closed at   with an increase of  it was also due to the outflow of capital from colombia and emerging economies due to changes in monetary policy in the united states shareholders approved capitalization the proposal made by javier gutierrez to capitalize the occasional reserves was approved and it remains like this the nominal value of the share will go from   to   however this will not affect the market value of the stock the authorized capital of the oil company will go from   billion to   billion in the same way the subscribed capital and the paid capital that will increase in both cases from   billion to   billion opinion gonzalo restrepo chairman of the board of directors of ecopetrol in the petrotiger case i was impressed by the degree of attention that the company has paid to these events however it is very difficult to stop this from happening  pedro rosales vice president of refining now the barrancabermeja refinery does not have the possibility of returning the investment quickly which is what the company needs so we have to wait tomas gonzalez minister of mines and energy thanks to the great efforts that the company has made last year the largest gas discovery in the colombian caribbean was achievedecopetrol will deliver dividends of   to shareholders the governments proposal was that  of the profits will be delivered to be distributed that is   billion at the price that was given for each purchased share and of those resources also deliver to the public treasury the figure that ended up being granted ecopetrol arrived at this proposal based on its net profit which constituted regulatory reserves of   million released the reserves of previous validity of   billion with which   billion were made available to the company this money will be distributed as follows establish reserves for unrealized company profits in  and previous years for   billion for new exploration reserves of   trillion and have reserves for future investments of   trillion the remaining   trillion was then proposed for the payment of taxed ordinary dividends although the first alternative for the payment of dividends to minority shareholders presented by ecopetrol was to deliver the resources in a single installment in september  the representative of the minority shareholders before the board of directors of ecopetrol roberto steiner requested that dividends will be paid in june of this year this proposal was accepted by the shareholders one of the initiatives within the assembly was that the dividends corresponding to minority shareholders be distributed accordingly while those of the government were used for investment however this alternative was not approved the majority shareholder would then have four installments to be made three of them before the end of  and the last installment would be delivered in may of next year according to margarita obregon ecopetrol general secretary the dividend that the company has distributed is among the highest paid by companies in colombia ecopetrol is in  in third place among colombian companies  the evolution of the distribution of profits has been over  since  the company has decreed dividends since  for more than   billion however the time of low oil prices and the lack of liquidity meant that the net profit from which the resources to pay dividends are obtained had a reduction of almost  going from   billion in  to     billion for  this is how the difference between these two years was close to   billion less the   billion that was delivered would correspond to having distributed all the assets  with the international situation if ecopetrol continues with this policy the company will be unviable  the situation is totally unsustainable he said the outgoing president javier genaro gutierrez and it is that in financial results net income decreased by   trillion going from   trillion in  to   trillion in  with a difference of  especially due to the effects of the oil price at this point foreign sales moved from   billion the year before to   billion last year on the other hand national sales rose from   billion in  to   billion in  last year sales costs incurred to bring the product to market increased by   billion   selling costs increased less than inflation increased  explained gutierrez of these fixed costs everything related to the transportation of hydrocarbons and services increased by   trillion  while variable costs decreased by   million  the opinion roberto steiner representative of minority shareholders ecopetrol the company can make an effort in its cash to pay dividends from minority shareholders in june and not in septemberthe barrels that gutierrez left to ecopetrol those of gutierrez were eight years of a radical transformation of the largest company in the country and one of the main sources for government investment since the nation owns  percent under his baton oil production proven reserves and crude oil transportation practically doubled and there is more the companys equity grew  times and went from turning the government  trillion pesos to  trillion see graphs likewise ecopetrol went from a single owner the nation to  thousand minority partners with the largest share issue in the history of the colombian stock exchange and with the simplicity recognized by his collaborators and the entitys board of directors see opinions on that growth path in which he directed one of the largest oil companies in latin america he prefers to say ecopetrols successes are not individual  they are all collective  but history repeats itself just as it managed to democratize ownership and lead interconectado electrica sa isa to be one of the main energy transporters in the region which managed  of the  years that it was in that company also with a state majority leaves ecopetrol as a solid multilatina and with enough fuel to face an adverse environment of low international oil prices and new growth pillars regardless of figures results and situations repeated in the media in this dialogue with el colombiano it is clear which are those three priceless barrels that he bequeathed to ecopetrol humility a lot of faith and a passion until his last day of work thus he responded a few minutes before the tribute of his collaborators were you expecting ecopetrols retirement or did you think you still had things to do i think the cycles are being fulfilled somehow the stage on the goals and objectives that we set for ourselves in  was already closing and the need for some adjustments in the strategic plan was seen i think it is a good time for a change  to preside over ecopetrol should you be an expert in hydrocarbons as many have suggested i do not think so without a doubt you must study know but above all you must have good judgment management skills know how to form a team and always be willing to learn what is your inheritance to the successor all those people and team with great talent sure that they are going to fall in love with this ecopetrol and its people as it happened to me after what was forged in isa and now with ecopetrol you are like the reformer the transformer of companies  laughter i am just a dreamer and i make people dream and make those dreams come true no more but it is the same people at ecopetrol who doing different things achieve those dreams not me  you are the provocateur  laughs thats right i am the motivator of the people but also the filing cabinet for all the papers he has in the office  laughter indeed i keep newspapers magazines documents but thank goodness everything is at hand on the computer and many in the head i must confess that i like to have these evidences on paper  what is in the heart and in the boxes you end up taking very few papers and much more the memories the affection of the people in these days i read something about alexander the great and his testament i do not know if reality or story which marked me he asked that at his death they put him in the coffin with his hands on the outside so that people would realize that one arrives and is goes emptyhanded  from what has been achieved what satisfaction do you have the biggest one is that after that harsh tragedy in dosquebradas risaralda on december   pipeline rupture due to a natural movement of the earth that left  deaths and  injured the day of the launch of the book huellas de esperanza february  which included the comprehensive intervention i was able to see peoples expressions there showing with them that ties can be rebuilt after the loss of loved ones and such difficult moments  lets go back to the beginning to  what did ecopetrol do the democratization achieved in isa  was what opened the door for me to join ecopetrol that first year i dedicated myself with the entire team to achieve capitalization the other thing that brought me was putting together the strategic plan the roadmap and getting people to think about reaching a million barrels clean barrels a commitment to life avoiding accidents and incidents this is how the companys growth expansion and internationalization process started  what was brought from isa to ecopetrol each one has its peculiarities but i believe that everything that has to do with values and ethics the issue of corporate governance relations with investors and the bases of the strategy to achieve growth and is it better to handle kilowatts or barrels of oil everyone has their emotions i have really enjoyed those two worlds in which i have been fortunate to work  what lessons did ecopetrol teach you undoubtedly i learned a lot from this industry and having joined a great team i was impressed by their response to crisis situations and difficulties and to keep this company growing no matter what the circumstances i learned how just doing things well impacts entire regions and the lives of many people  but his collaborators tell me that they learned to work  percent  laughs he plays and i think that is the result of desire and enthusiasm the best thing that can happen to you is that you like the work you do because it is enjoying life when you put on love you feel like it and if people get that everything works better thats the key  and transcending borders ecopetrol is already a multinational  they are fundamental bets in the united states peru and brazil the most important thing has been with ecopetrol america inc which started as an exploratory embryo today it is a seam of growth findings have already been made and a production program is being consolidated which today is  barrels per day and for  it is expected to reach  barrels  did you want to find a site like cusiana or cupiagua there are at least two relevant achievements  gas in deep waters of the colombian caribbean in alliance with petrobras brazil and repsol spain and that of the  block in meta with talisman which if it is not of the magnitude of a cusiana in the future may have a similar evolution  what made you gray at ecopetrol perhaps the years and some concerns but as we say in antioquia the procession goes inside ecopetrol is a complex company and you have to learn to handle those ballots that appear every day  have universities already flirted with you to share their knowledge not until now but undoubtedly i would like to return to academic environments as when i was young when i had the opportunity to be a teacher and it was very enriching meanwhile i am going to enjoy the family more catch up on readings he likes biographies and listen to music he enjoys everything from classical to danceable  what is your final message for ordinary shareholders i tell you that ecopetrol is a solid company with an excellent work team and very good assets with great opportunities to grow in production exploration and to continue improving transportation and refining businesses as up to now what is experienced today with the price of the action starts from understanding that there are some price cycles and you must have a little patience i have no doubt that there will be times of growth and the opportunity to recover investments and make profits ecopetrol guarantees the supply of liquefied petroleum gas for apriljune thus on march  the company assigned lpg to the market for the period between april and june based on the regulation and methodology established by creg and the circular of march  where

the thousands of workers of the company and also expressed his respect and admiration for gutierrez who directed ecopetrol for the last eight years echeverry has held positions as executive director

well as having been a consultant and commentator economic as well as having advised several governments and companies the new president of ecopetrol was a member of the companys board of directorsecheverry arrived at ecopetrol with increases in the action the ecopetrol stock closed on the local stock exchange with a positive variation of  to   in the new york market it rose  to trade at us   and in toronto its price rose  and ended the day at  canadian dollars us   according to stock market analysts despite the fact that the market had already discounted the arrival of echeverry to the presidency if the title should be followed up while waiting for the reactions generated by their decisions in the stock prices the market will have to allow time for coupling so that it becomes familiar and executes the policies it plans to apply said andres rosas strategy analyst at global securites rosas added that the market will be waiting for announcements on specific measures regarding the policy of cost and expense cuts to face the current situation and on the fulfillment of production goals as well as the entry into operation of the refinery of cartagena which is projected for september for his part omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores told lr that it should be noted that the local stock market had a positive rally as a result of the negative employment data that were delivered on friday and against which generated an inverse relationship and the calm that brought the less expansionary speech of the fed two weeks ago this he said generates a fall in the dollar and that an increase in the price of oil which hits stocks such as ecopetrol but despite yesterdays good results the stock has not had a good year on wall street between january  and the last day it fell  in the case of the colombian stock market and the toronto stock exchange there is growth so far in  with variations of  and  respectively the movements in this action cannot be seen without the context given by oil prices which at the close of the markets were at us   the wti with an increase of  and at us   the brent an increase of  according to international analysts this move has to do with the announcement by saudi arabia the worlds largest oil producer to increase the prices of its sales to asia this would be the second monthly rise which also hits the price of the dollar in addition they said that it was the second largest increase in the price of a barrel in the year after last january  it reached a variation of  opinions omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores the local stock market had a positive rally ecopetrols behavior is influenced by the fall in the price of the dollar and the increase in the price of oil  andres rosas strategy analyst at global securities we attribute the rise in ecopetrols share to an increase of  in a barrel of oil and the   appreciation that the dollar has sufferedoffshore gulf of mexico and core fields ecopetrols priorities this is a business in which you have to invest many times in dry fields but with one that is a producer many of those investments are paid in a situation like this priority must be given to investments that create value offshore in colombia the gulf of mexico and central fields those are ecopetrols priorities he indicated regarding the offshore fields in colombia the president of ecopetrol explained that during his splicing process the ceo of shell told him that one of his priorities is in the colombian caribbean and recalled that the orca  well was considered as the discovery largest in latin america additionally regarding the core fields in colombia echeverry said that ecopetrol has more than  fields and in  it produces  of its oil getting the oil in these wells costs up to us   we have marginal fields that cost us   but they are few the truth is that we have a lot of margin although a barrel at us   hits us hard the idea is to extract barrels with value we have to prepare to be a solid company with barrels between us   and us   we will leave the marginal fields to other companies and we will keep the core fields  regarding the issue of the cartagena refinery reficar echeverry explained that his priority is to get the refinery up and running beyond the cost overruns that the project brought with it as minister of finance i was one of the biggest critics of reficars cost overruns but my priority is to turn on the refinery and put it to produce value this can generate up to us   million per month he said speaking about labor issues and the claims of the unions echeverry was forceful in assuring that there have been no massive layoffs but the expiration of contracts for personnel outside ecopetrol and when asked about the salaries of the companys executives he former minister said that ecopetrol pays the necessary salaries to hire and retain the best possible people finally echeverry explained that cuts in investments of   billion have already been made that the company already has a  strategic plan ready and was categorical in stating that fracking is part of the future of the oil industry and that therefore one cannot be a fundamentalist when talking about this technologydirector of public credit leaves office assumes ecopetrol subsidiary vicepresidency it was not possible to immediately know who will replace janna who had served as the countrys financial chief since february  in the coming days janna will assume the position of financial vice president of cenit the transportation and hydrocarbons company of the stateowned ecopetrol they said sources from the ministry of finance and the oil company who asked to keep their names in reserve janna is a professional and a master in economics from the universidad de los andes and a phd in economics from northwestern university the executive has served as vice presidentchief of sovereign risk for the americas at goldman sachs advisor to the ministry of finance and public an economist in the economic and market research area for latin america at citibank new york and as a specialist in financial stability at the central bank of colombiain two weeks the ecopetrol strategic plan is out which the market is waiting for echeverry said that in a couple of weeks the final report that was made with the american consulting firm boston consulting group will be delivered and that it has been consolidating with the board of directors for more than six months see offshore gulf of mexico and core fields ecopetrols priorities in this plan the manager added that the restructuring of the vice presidencies is not being considered as had been rumored and instead the document is focused more than on an administrative restructuring in creating the new focus of the company in this the first is exploration and how to make that exploration produce new discoveries the second focus is production since here we know that we have worldclass competition three transportation which we have already advanced and is already very profitable and fourth refining which now enters cartagena doubling its capacity and barrancabermeja which is in the pipeline these are the four focuses of the plan  according to analyst diego franco from asesoria e inversiones the company will have to be quite demanding on these points since despite the exploration issue which is fundamental for the market what is being demanded of the state one is that it be explored in areas that generate positive results that is that increase the drilling success rate of the company since the market will be more and more above each peso that the company spends in the same way he adds that another of the focuses that would improve the valuation of the oil company in the stock exchanges where it has a presence are the new discoveries and the movements it makes in mexico regarding this echeverry commented that the company will focus on continuing to explore in colombian territory offshore and mainly the caribbean coast and indeed the gulf of mexico where there is already a presence and studies for exploration are being carried out in addition in terms of savings this year the austerity plan has already generated a drop in expenses by   billion which will be permanent within the company on the other hand regarding the resounding sale of the remaining  of the company that has been approved by congress the manager commented that although it is a matter of the board of directors he has not heard anything about it and has not been raised with the idea opinion with which several market analysts agree who when consulted comment that the hypothesis was discarded some time ago and that if it were to occur it would be taken negatively for this reason from now on the company aims to extract investment resources from internally generated income and from debt in equal percentages within the strategy it is also established that ecopetrol will not directly operate the more than  fields that it is in charge of since  of the production is only  where the company will be focused therefore the remaining wells which are smaller will be developed by other companies that are more agile and increase their production regarding reserves the president pointed out that the best way to generate them in addition to finding them is by extracting from mature fields a strategy that has worked very well for ecopetrol with secondary recovery techniques so we are going to transfer that strategy to the exploration so that it contributes to the increase in reserves and we are also going to strengthen our team both in bogota and in houston there we have a company called ecopetrol america with the idea of attracting human capital with  and  years of exploration experience  likewise he pointed out that offshore exploration and near uraba will be aggressively attacked see ecopetrol exceeded  barrels per day in the first two months regarding taxes which was one of the great complaints of the outgoing president of the company echeverry commented that for the moment the administration seeks to produce profits before taxes and already the subject afterwards work will be done in conjunction with the oil industry to make colombia attractive in the short and long term finally the president is still in the process of joining so he did not refer to the expected centralization of the more than  headquarters of the company or to the new markets but he did comment that in the commercial area there are many benefits and that one is the blends that are very attractive in asia and that are more profitable for ecopetrol so now they are already recovering more dollars in margin for selling more to asia than to america new technologies and the cartagena refinery the president pointed out that the new technologies are good and the point is not whether they should be used or not but how to do it to guarantee that they are clean that they generate wellbeing and that they are efficient so in this matter if these criteria are applied they could be used as they do around the world the profitability of the refinery on the other hand will be high since it will double its refining capacity before we added us   in value per refined barrel now we are going to add us   the refinery may be able to generate up to us   million per month in turnover  diego francos opinion advisory and investment analyst the company will have to be quite demanding in the plan since the market is demanding that it be explored in areas that generate positive resultsecopetrol from gutierrez to echeverry its been a month since the board of directors of ecopetrol appointed former minister of finance juan carlos echeverry to the presidency of the most important company in colombia designation made from the casa de narino that has been received with many reservations by experts in the oil market and that has not been perceived in the companys share movements and there are many expectations about the management of the former minister since he lacks corporate experience and knowledge of the sector his appointment was known on march  and took office on monday april  after a long month of training by the outgoing ceo javier genaro gutierrez pemberthy beyond the fact that the former minister is the media promoter of the term jam that he said that with his illfated  tax reform he was going to make the rich cry or that he was screwed up with his econometric analysis of what the colombian economy was larger than argentina we cannot expect any other destination that ecopetrol does very well under his administration because it is not a secret for anyone that it is not only the company that pays the most taxes that it contributes the most to the state coffers  but rather the one that generates and invests the most jobs in very disadvantaged areas of the country in short it is imperative that echeverry does very well in his time through the joint venture since we cannot forget that it is the determining issuing company in the secondary market and that half a million colombians between natural and legal persons have securities in the company it is urgent for the market that echeverry unveils the strategic plan that the company in gutierrezs time contracted with the private consulting firm boston consulting group in which the longterm roadmap of the colombian oil company is outlined it is key to tell shareholders if the company maintains its production forecasts if it will maintain its investments in the refineries if its structure of vice presidents will continue in times of lean times it is necessary to know what your exploration plan is in colombian territory or in neighboring countries but the most important thing of all is to know what you think of the sale of  approved several years ago by the congress of the republic there are many earrings that echeverry has who must go from the anecdotal and trivial to show his caste as ceo of one of the  most important companies in forbes magazine gutierrez was responsible for managing the fat cows of ecopetrol while echeverry will have to do the same with the skinny ones however in times of crisis real changes can be brought forward in the companiesfall in price of the ecopetrol title reduced the number of shareholders in the bvc this was pointed out by jaime humberto lopez president of the association of colombian stock brokers asobolsa who told lr that it went from having  investors through the colombian stock exchange bvc to  lopez added that we must continue working to ensure that small investors are in the collective investment funds fic as he affirmed that this is the business of the future how many shareholders do you have in colombia and what number do you expect to reach today we have around  shareholders in colombia and before they were more or less  which means that there was a significant reduction when ecopetrols stock started to fall many people decided to get out that was a mistake this title had attracted more than  people the phenomenon of stocks is volatile now there are ways of being shareholders indirectly through the collective investment funds fic this is a product that both trustees and commission agents are developing and we think that this will meet the need for shareholders how many shareholders do you hope to reach i wish there were more shareholders in colombia we prefer that the small ones are investors of collective investment funds because we have suppliers that cost us money so we pass that cost on to these shareholders who are worth as much as the dividends they earn so it is not profitable the colcap has shown good figures in recent days is this a good sign for the results of the first quarter i hope so because there is a reality and that is that stocks are cheap so investors already know that the share price in colombia is attractive so it is important that they begin to react has the movement of the dollar affected the commission agents we did not expect the dollar so high and that has generated a lot of concern our activity has to do with the abundance of the dollar which is why we have been victims of this fact what are the challenges of the stock market the main challenge is to think about innovation and new products the idea is to work with what we have to give more turns to the business status of broker fees the fees charged by brokerage firms have not grown significantly in at least the last seven years jaime humberto lopez president of asobolsa explained that the commissions have been maintained since the investors in a certain way have set their conditions the volume has increased but not these rates in this sense i do not believe that they will grow much this year perhaps they will have an increase because the market will react taking into account the situation but surely it will not be a high percentage he said the opinion guillermo sinisterra professor of economics at the universidad javeriana there are other alternatives to equities the stock market has many substitutes fixed income and the international market ecopetrol has had to pay the bills of its international partners similarly in a case of association of the palagua field operated by texas petroleum company the state oil company has had to assume expenses of   million to recover from cumulative environmental impacts the control body reported that it made nine fiscal findings for   million in this audit and in total the cgr determined  administrative findings  with disciplinary scope in this way the control body established that ecopetrol did not have the necessary foresight to receive the association fields so after the deliveries it had to contract several companies to recover the wells finally a production contract for the palaguacaipal field was found among others where ecopetrol and union temporal ijp allocated   million to acquire  meters of pipe that has not been used which led to the update of the plan of environmental management required by anla however the company indicated through a statement from the financial superintendency that it presented the reports and evidence that demonstrate that its actions in the aforementioned cases did not detract from the companys assets and were executed in strict compliance with colombian legislationecopetrols tax and investment commission among the  issues that have been in existence for  years in  as now a commission was established to study how to get the country out of the fiscal hole it was in and looking at the press records of march and april of that year it is found that this highlevel group was trying to that public spending be reduced that there be penalties for tax evaders that the gasoline tax be created and that a temporary surcharge be made on income and wealth taxes as an image that repeats itself today there is also a commission of tax experts and several of the elements proposed in  are included in the recommendations that international organizations have made to the country this year and some of them such as temporary surcharges to taxes or the promise to cut spending are part of the decisions and laws that the government has adopted in the last six months the former minister of finance roberto junguito explains that the fiscal problem at that time was similar to that of now although he points out that at that time inflation and the balance of payments problem were much worse although it is true that the cpi did not reach the  in  that it reached in  the internal inconveniences derived from international affairs return to the ring  years later at that time explains junguito in a  banco de la republica br document the price of coffee had been falling continuously since  which led to a sharp deterioration in the external sector today the villain is no longer agricultural but mining and the  drop in oil prices that has been occurring since the end of last year caused oil exports to drop  in all of  and  if the first two months of  are compared with the same period of the previous year as now the price of the dollar was high and president guillermo leon valencia promised incentives to attract more tourists to the country for the codirector of br adolfo meisel this is normal because economies move in cycles and he argues that colombia is dependent on the exploitation of basic resources due to their abundance however it recognizes that there are problems such as infrastructure that should not be recurring for that  years ago the then candidate carlos lleras restrepo grandfather of vice president german vargas lleras praised the progress of the instituto de credito territorial in financing  homes in seven

what must be done to once again be the number one company in latin america how to raise the drilling success rate we want to go back to becoming a company that finds oil we and the other companies in the region have had a lower success rate than we aspire to so what we start to do is have a new doctrine of exploration that involves new people substantially expand the amount of human capital that

becoming insolvent how many exploration contractors have you not extended contracts to we are in a period in which oil companies throughout the world have stressed cash because the price fell by half so with the same barrels we produce half the dollars and the fundamental thing in these periods is the cash that is generated by one internally or provided by the banks so for now its time to adjust i think the calculation may be exaggerated but it is striking in our case we have not canceled specific contracts we have let expiring contracts fade and contracts that we were going to do for development we postponed them they were not canceled but postponed of those that have been allowed to wither how many are there many were related to reficar and since it is already at   ecopetrol was clear that all those contracts were ending others of those were development of fields but curiously in the plains in chichimene and castilla we have been doing much more development so that these contracts have been maintained or increased in that area also in santander on our part there is no cancellation policy we are renegotiating and that is also a request from the company that will affect the cash how is the export basket in terms of the mix will they seek like pacific to increase vasconia crude we have in castillachichimene about  barrels so the idea is to improve the recovery there in the same way as last year in chichimene where we went from  to  barrels per day regarding the second question the strategies are common so yes one of the plans is the construction of the new headquarters to centralize what would the investment be and where would it be located with the price in half i dont know how to think about making buildings it is completely ruled out when it was high where was it planned they told me that the place where the headquarters complex is now has a very nice lot but in a company with prices of us   it is not a priority in the gulf of mexico there are two wells that produce  barrels a day what is the potential how are the barrels distributed we have  barrels today and for next year we expect to be at  the most important thing with shell to be able to get more barrels is to connect to the fields near them because they are the ones with the pipes so i was talking to the president of shell to leave us reasonable rates how is exploration in mexico going like the entire industry we are waiting for something very important that may happen there and we are prequalified for the first round but we do not really have any projects yet in the gulf we have had discoveries we just have four more fields for the future when would the orca  well go into production and what investment are you planning there we already know that there is gas the operator is petrobras and we are in talks with them for the second orca  appraisal well we hope that this will happen throughout this year but there is no official estimate yet according to wood mackienzi it is the largest hydrocarbon discovery in latin america last year and the important thing is that it showed that there are hydrocarbons offshore we do not have the numbers yet and based on that the investments will be defined later orca  is the first step how much is being invested to explore offshore we are now drilling a field in the southern colombian caribbean and also outside the country the exploration budget for this year is close to us   million just as it is less than  with a portfolio approach we have optimized it but i trust the team out there we have a very experienced person who has a new doctrine and what we are building is promising we would like to have more money we hope it is more and the focus is definitely offshore the profile juan carlos echeverry is an economist

losses would be recorded again for the last half of last year however this profit figure turned out to be very positive under current conditions additionally it is important to highlight the management of crude oil production since the results were influenced by the rise in this figure between january and march in the first quarter of  a total volume of  kboed thousands of barrels of oil equivalent was reached a figure  higher than that of the first and last quarter of  however the subsidiaries managed to increase production close to  which would indicate one of the factors that lacks more management  says diego franco valoralta broker who added that in the same way this result is positive since with low prices ecopetrol achieved a important task of making a profit even with sales that decreased by about  among the achievements is refining where there was a growth of  that is to say that despite the situation they were more profitable  this being the case the management of the new administration seems to be bearing fruit since the companys cost reduction plan based on fewer interventions to wells improvement in maintenance routines and equipment reliability and replacement of the equipment  of electricity generation with diesel ended up influencing the results the cost incurred for sales was reduced by  from   billion in the first quarter of  to   billion in  the decrease in the costs of purchases of crude oil gas and products due to lower prices  as well as lower fixed costs due to optimizations in the maintenance plan and contracted services are the main explanations of the behavior  said the president of the company juan carlos echeverry finally according to andres rosas an analyst at global securities the market is still attentive to the  strategic plan since with regard to profits they were expected to be flat in terms of margins successes in exploration of the company for the company it is important to highlight that in exploration the success of  drilled by hocol was reported which is expected to strengthen the development of gas sources on the atlantic coast likewise progress was made in the drilling of kronos and calasu in the southern part of the offshore caribbean operated in association with anadarko   finally ecopetrol drilled four boundary wells among which nueva  and nueva  stand out with which the potential of block  is

operating performance camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones obviously the results are much lower than those of the first half of  but with the current situation they are very acceptable for the companyecopetrols profits in the first quarter of the year fell  and reached   million according to the company low oil prices affected its revenues which went from   billion in  to   billion

three months of  the results of the oil company were announced in accordance with the international financial reporting standards ifrsecopetrol share rose  after delivery of financial results for andres rosas strategy analyst at global securites this shows that the profit data is the first one that many investors look at and the market had high expectations that the company would report losses again so the   saved the issue  for his part omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores indicated that the earnings result continues to show that the company is not doing well and the longterm analysis may even reflect an impact on the dividend for  it is a difficult subject because the results of   million of net profit is not much you have to look at it in the long term which is expected to be of ecopetrols profit by the end of the year because no matter how well it will do it will make   billion with this the dividend will fall below   per share which would generate a downward pressure on ecopetrols share he explained regarding the possibility that the first quarter results augur an acceptable year for the company rosas indicated that this may occur depending on the comparison made if you look against the fourth quarter of  there will be a recovery since the price of oil has stabilized around us   per barrel now if you look against the same period of the previous

equivalent per day kboed that is  corresponds to direct production by the company and is  higher than that achieved in the same period in  for the company this performance is this is mainly explained by the entry of production facilities in the castilla and chichimene fields which also achieved record productions in castilla a figure of over  kbpd was reached in february while in chichimene a production record of  kbpd was achieved in january with this the company points out that the oil complex made up of the castilla and chichemene fields in meta become the main hydrocarbon production area in the country extracting about  of the national production finally regarding the production of the associated companies  kboed were extracted  less than what was achieved in the first quarter of

production between  and  annually likewise it will focus on the production of efficient barrels and will carry out a comprehensive program to increase the recovery factor see video ecopetrols investment in exploration focused on the sea it will seek to increase production annually between  and  on average with a view to exceeding approximately  equivalent daily barrels in  seeking an ebitda per barrel greater than us   in a scenario where the price of brent crude is between us   and us   per barrel the company said in a statement the company expects to incorporate  billion barrels of oil equivalent by  in proven reserves the strategy according to the company will be based on the production of efficient clean and valuable barrels that generate benefits for shareholders and other stakeholders  as well as all colombians the perspective towards  will be to seek to double compared to the end of  the return on capital employed  the other point is financial discipline in which they will focus on investments with high returns moderate debt maintenance of credit rating divestment of nonstrategic assets austerity in purchases optimization of procurement and supply and opportunity in payments to suppliers  read ecopetrols financial figures in  hurt the stock markets at this point the company pointed out that the estimated annual investments in the next five years will be us   million and will continue with divestment plans in nonstrategic assets such as those announced in eeb and isa among others ecopetrol pointed out that since the beginning of this year it began a transformation plan to achieve annual savings of around us   billion in the  period this plan contemplates profound transformations within the company both in the business segments as well as in project management technology relationship with the environment and active portfolio management the company said these with the axes of the strategy harmonious development of the four key segments profitable growth in exploration and production and maximization of efficiency in transportation and refining exploration new exploratory doctrine focused on basins with great potential such as the offshore areas of colombia and the gulf of mexico that contributes to the continuous and sufficient increase of reserves production prioritization of efficient barrels without a volumetric limit generating value based on the increase in the recovery factor the unique knowledge of the colombian environment and a highly developed resource base efficiency and sustainability in transportation and refining aggressive companywide transformation program to structurally increase efficiency and reduce costs production of clean fuels for colombia consistent with the environment financial discipline investments with high profitability moderate debt maintenance of credit rating divestment of nonstrategic assets austerity in purchases optimization of procurement and supply and opportunity in payments to suppliers labor wellbeing and social peace achievement of a work environment that promotes personal and professional advancement in harmony with union organizations and with a positive contribution to the development of the communities and other interest groups where we operate physical personal and infrastructure security compliance with international hse standards protection of our staff against intimidation and the infrastructure against aggression cultural change based on the principles of integrity collaboration and creativity and on the requirement of compliance with the code of ethics by all ecopetrol employees and workersthe five focuses of ecopetrol to reinvent itself and reach  with production of  barrels the current focus of the company is the generation of value over simple volumetric figures said the president of the company juan carlos echeverry this is why a great growth in production is not expected and it is no longer projected to reach a million barrels but to  on average per day but looking for the ebitda per barrel to be us   offshore exploration in the sustainability strategy that the company seeks the areas with the greatest projection will be explored thus focusing with a staff of  years of experience on six offshore wells in colombia four or five in the gulf of mexico and brazil this based on the knowledge of the potential that these places have for alejandro martinez former president of acp this is a very successful strategy since for example in mexico it is known that it is a basin that has shown to have high probabilities of success thus it is expected to rationalize the investment having between  and  drilling per year in addition to rationalizing the exploration capex with investments of us   to us   million by  with this the company expects to add  million barrels of proven reserves  production with value for the company this point is fundamental and it is its strategic focus since although they do not expect large growth in volume an average annual growth of  to  they do expect it to be profitable this being the case for every   that is invested to extract a barrel about   will return to the box for rafael guzman technical vice president of the company this goal of  barrels will be achieved by increasing the recovery factor above the  average in all fields the main recovery and the infill technique will be the focus until  and from then on the secondary and tertiary recovery techniques will be the focus of the company for this reason the investment destined to exploration will be us   million on average per year which will favor the technologies to extract more crude  however for diego franco a broker from valoralta this is a very conservative strategy highly related to oil prices however this could be a commercial strategy seeking that if crude prices increase the market will be surprised  begin to recover investments in transportation the company will begin to recover the investments that have been made in the construction of oil pipelines and infrastructure which will not only generate income but also a large decrease in costs for tomas rueda president of cenit we will continue to create cash to be selfsufficient and the investments of us   million in   and of us   million and us   million for  will be only to complete ongoing projects and maintenance of the assets refining and structural changes for the company another focus is the reduction of costs based especially on being more efficient with the use of energy lowering maintenance costs and taking advantage of the entrance of the cartagena refinery and the transportation infrastructure thus the company seeks to reduce us   million in five years that will become permanent favoring the cash register additionally it is expected that  of the financing will come from private income and that only  of indebtedness seeking to reach  which will also continue to disinvest in nonstrategic assets the opinions juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol we are in an aggressive program of transformation of the company to be able to compete in the current conditionsecopetrols new roadmap for  ecopetrol revealed its roadmap for the next five years focused on eight fundamental axes it is the first time that senior management has presented a clear position on what the future of the company will be the pillars of this strategy go back a long way and were painted by an external consulting firm he calls the first axis harmonious development of the four key segments profitable growth in exploration and production and maximizing efficiency in transportation and refining second exploration focused on basins with great potential such as offshore areas of colombia and the gulf of mexico that contribute to the continuous and sufficient increase of reserves production prioritization of efficient barrels without a volumetric limit generating value based on the recovery is the fourth point announced by the company in a press release the fifth axis is efficiency and sustainability in transportation and refining which consists of redesigning the company under efficiency and reducing costs the sixth point has to do with financial discipline consisting of profitable investments moderate debt maintenance of credit rating divestment of nonstrategic assets austerity in purchases optimization of procurement and supply and opportunity in payments to suppliers it is followed by labor welfare and social peace based on harmony with trade union organizations and positive contribution to community development and other interest groups the last axis of the new navigation chart wants a cultural change based on the principles of integrity collaboration and creativity and on the requirement of compliance with the code of ethics by all ecopetrol employees and workers in the words of its new ceo juan carlos echeverry the company will seek to increase annual production between  and  on average with a view to exceeding  barrels per day equivalent in  seeking an ebitda per barrel of more than us   in a scenario of brent crude price between us   and us   per barrel  it is clear that its divestment plans in nonstrategic assets began with those announced in eeb and isa among others for the first time in its recent history the company publicly presents a strategy that becomes a good message to the half million legal entities that have shares in the mixed oil company the prices of colombian crude in the international market are rebounding and the lean period of the last year will allow ecopetrol to find a better way into the future for the good of the national finances and of the holders of its shares ecopetrols new roadmap is timely and was overdue to be presented so that players would have a clearer map of where the company is goingecopetrol has all the credentials to participate in ronda uno de mexico the socalled round  has already taken place and here the areas that were to continue to be under pemexs operation were established however round  which is the first of multiple rounds to be organized by the cnh national hydrocarbons commission and which presented opportunities to obtain shallow water rights in  blocks  exploratory blocks and  blocks in production is under development thus the preclassification of this stage where investment

managed to increase their income although not their profits and have won the title of kings in billing they are ecopetrol in oil drummond in mines and epm in energy the achievement is meritorious because added to the contraction of the sector in general factors emerged that did not help to improve the situation one of them was the fall in the prices of minerals since in the period in which coal gold and nickel were priced at high prices operations began in several new mines in the world particularly in australia and indonesia and the existing ones significantly expanded their production giving rise to an oversupply which together with the falling demand from china and the united states the largest consumers led to a reduction in prices between  and  this has left companies in the extractive industry in a place where if they do not increase their competitiveness and lower their production costs they exit the market in fact according to the latest projections of the mining compass  of the countrys companies will reduce their expansions and  will reduce them indicating among other aspects that they do not feel great support from the government that prices will continue to be at the same rate low and that there are major flaws in legal stability especially due to the continuous increase in taxation which according to experts has led to the large mining companies having felt a drop in foreign investment and a decrease in their remittances parent companies on the other hand companies explain that royalties and taxes in colombia are considerably high when compared to the indices of the region which slows down competitiveness proof of this is a study by the former minister of mines guillermo perry in which he pointed out that in the case of coal if a company produces more than three million tons it pays  in royalties in the country while in argentina it is pays  in brazil  in chile between  and  depending on the volume of sales and not of production and in peru between  and  however two of the  companies that billed the most last year and which are also within the group of the first  with the highest revenues in  belong to the mining sector these are drummond and carbones del cerrejon occupying positions  and  respectively the operating income of the first company was   billion with a negative variation of  in relation to  while those of the second were   trillion presenting a negative variation of  compared to  after four years the oil companies enjoyed prices above us   per barrel  was a year bittersweet since since july prices began to plummet rapidly and there was no way to stop them this being the case and in just six months the hydrocarbon companies lost half of their income so the large gains that had been made in the first months were erased leaving a last period of losses only in ecopetrol at the end of  the net profit was   trillion  less than in  even so it continues to occupy the number one position in the ranking of the  companies with the highest income in the country  followed by terpel with   million in profit and a decrease of  compared to  with this outlook the companies action plan was to start an aggressive crash program based on cost reduction especially in the area destined to exploration programs this situation deteriorated as prices continued to fall reaching us   per barrel at a near parity between wti and brent which evidenced a negative effect on the liquidity of oil companies proof of this is that in the first four months of  only nine exploratory wells were drilled which represented a drop of  compared to the same period in  when  wells had been drilled as for seismic  kilometers have been executed a fall of  thus during the first quarter of  the fob value of exports decreased  versus the same period of  while the volume increased  in line with the performance of production which companies have tried to maintain above a million barrels colombia has managed to diversify its commercial partners in particular between  and  when chinas participation in colombian crude sales increased from  to  that of india from  to  and that of spain from  to   even so the oil companies continue to be leaders in business matters weighing  in the industry said francisco lloreda president of the acp energy sector the public services sector achieved  of gdp in  according to dane a sector in which the national association of public services and communications companies andesco indicated that in electrical energy the coverage is close to   in interconnected areas the challenge is the incorporation of alternative energies and the definitive introduction of electric transport systems at the private and public services level said gustavo galvis andescos executive president in the ranking of the largest companies in the sector are epm electricaribe esp and codensa esp with revenues of   billion   billion and   billion government measures to create dynamism at the head of the ministry of mines and energy has been the work of creating tools that help the sector in the crisis especially when oil income has seriously affected the state coffers this is how the national hydrocarbons agency anh was allowed to give the companies the freedom to postpone contracts and investments the   billion figures were ecopetrols operating income which ranked first   billion were terpels operating income which ranked second opinions francisco jose lloreda president of the acp colombia has managed to diversify its commercial partners particularly between  and  gustavo galvis executive president of andesco the current challenge is to incorporate alternative energy and use electric transportecopetrols  exploration includes  pilot projects thus max torres the companys vice president of exploration pointed out that the idea is to deliver contingent barrels that replace the companys reserves since for an oil company to be sustainable it must replace at least  of the barrels it produces in the year this being the case and with current conditions the manager estimates that the company should carry out at least  exploratory operations a year to achieve a  rate by  additionally according to the company these explorations must be in different countries wells and play concepts bedrock reservoir trap etc so that currently  of the groups portfolio is in the gulf of mexico  blocks and  with direct operation  in colombia  blocks with  in direct operation and  in brazil two directly operated blocks and one in association within  it is also that for each barrel produced us   is allocated to investment to explore also in terms of production as is already known the goal is incremental oil but it is intended within  that the company becomes a leader in asset development with the implementation of secondary and tertiary recovery projects in addition to the already known infill technique of primary recovery where there is shortterm potential explained hector manosalva vice president of development and production in this way close to   million have already been invested to evaluate research related to improved recovery production and unconventional deposits in addition of the   million for  that will be invested in six projects for castilla valle medio del magdalena yarigui and catatumbo thus in   more projects would enter the production process of which  are for water injection  for improved water six for gas and three for thermal recovery for the former minister of mines luis ernesto mejia the strategy of increasing recovery factors is totally rational and necessary since it is the most efficient way to increase production and reserves in the short term  is aggressive versus  today but achievable however in the long term we have to look at the basics that is explore explore and explore  and he added that for both strategies recovery and exploration factor a better investment environment is needed both in fiscal terms as well as

court irregularities were committed in the first and second instance rulings by the judges after  workers sued the company for alleged breaches of collective bargaining agreements we believe that

of cucuta taken by three magistrates two of them in favor and one that except by vote  affirmed the president of the chamber judge clara cecilia duenas for the court there were inconsistencies related to the servers in this case since they ruled on a reason that had not been requested by the plaintiffs without taking into account the allegations and exceptions proposed by the defendant without elaborating on further reasoning as happened with the court the court concludes that the aforementioned order of first instance was the result of the judgment of the judge not of the evidentiary and legal reasoning that was due to it in accordance with the cited norms points out the sentence faced with the alleged irregularities the labor chamber forwarded copies to the office of the attorney

refining company in south korea becomes an important buyer of colombian oil since for the second time in less than eight months it acquires crude from ecopetrol the asian company has a  thousand barrel  day capacity refinery suitable for processing heavy and intermediate crude and from its refinery in daesan south korea produces and distributes petroleum and petrochemical products in the local market and exports to china japan southeast asia australia and new zealand for the company the continuous purchases of castilla crude by hyundai reflect the continuous growth in demand for crude oil by asian refiners in the face of expansion of refining capacity and strategic storage in the same way they denote the interest of both europe and asia to diversify import sources in the face of certain instability in the supply from the middle east and north africa finally it is worth noting that during the first quarter of  ecopetrols exports represented  of the companys total sales and between january and march of this year exports to destinations other than the us gulf coast were maintained above  levels similar to those of the same period in  and a significant advance compared to the  achieved in ecopetrol parex and shell are the companies authorized to use the fracking technique however due to the situation and the high costs required the only company in the country that would be willing and prepared to carry out the use of this technology is ecopetrol la petrolera during the coflu  cempo  congress which will be held in the other week it will have one of its professionals specialized in unconventional fields jorge italo bahamon explaining the use of this controversial technique and when the state oil company will be interested in starting work ecopetrol sells to south korea on the other hand and within ecopetrols strategy of diversifying its partners in asia the company signed a new memorandum of understanding with the south korean firm hyundai oilbank for the sale of one million barrels of castilla crude whose shipment is scheduled for july from the port of covenas in this way hyundai oilbank the third largest refining company in south

gulf coast remained above ecopetrol alerted for impersonation to get a job once again the company invites people to refrain from negotiating delivering money goods and services to people who seek to obtain profit through the fraudulent use of the ecopetrol name the company highlighted while invited to denounce this kind of acts the company also denounced that false mass calls for up to  jobs are being created through social networks specialized in job offers or professional connections which adds to the identity theft of managers and officials in order to commit scams with false requests for goods and services to local companies on behalf of the oil company the company recalls that neither ecopetrol nor its contractor companies charge for the intermediation of a selection process said the oil company while recalling that the president of the company does not sign contracts for the provision of services or purchase of goods and reiterates that all the information related to purchasing issues is published in a timely manner on the website  likewise he stated that the company does not establish agreements covenants or alliances with natural or legal persons for their intermediation or on behalf of ecopetrol in contracting processes the following are the communication channels with ecopetrol the telephone lines to communicate with the company are  switch   attention line

after a  drop in this sense the end of the period set to buy shares and have the right to the dividend decreed at the shareholders meeting that took place in march is one of the main reasons for its title to present a significant drop it should be noted that ecopetrols share last friday also closed lower presenting a  devaluation which made it accumulate a negative variation of  in the yearat ecopetrol there are no massive layoffs mintrabajo what ecopetrol has done is to stop hiring indirectly employability has dropped but that does not mean that there are massive layoffs obviously we are facing different situations i want to send a very clear message at ecopetrol there are no massive layoffs what there is is that they are not renewing contracts for temporary workers or workers from fixed hiring systems garzon reported the head of the labor portfolio said that they are talking with the oil company to discuss how much it can affect peoples employment because from the low price of crude investment in employment and especially in exploration will be greatly affected  despite the exploitation being proceeding normally on the other hand garzon said that they are working with all sectors affected by massive layoffs either due to low incomes or by laws it refers to cases such as those of the balance of powers reform that the superior council of the judiciary eliminated and therefore the workers of the very soon extinct entity will have to be relocated or the antismuggling law that would affect small merchants we are going to work with all those who are affected by the social situation there are oil workers who are affected by the price or the departure of oil companies from the country we are also going to do it with people who are affected by the elimination of the judiciary we have also done it with ponque ramo in the same way to the extent that there is smuggling employment the economy industry and commerce are also affected and illegality prevails said the minister in that sense garzon said that in this semester lowering the unemployment rate will be necessary for the ministry since situations like that of cucuta in which unemployment is at  higher than the national index have to change finally he said that the impact on employment caused by the latest attacks on the pipelines has not been given the importance the issues that have to do with the war have come but the social intangibles have not been measured all kinds of attacks are reprehensible but these attacks affect the poor the issue of attacking the oil industry what it does is confront the possibility of investment that not only affects social policy even more it unfortunately contributes to the issue of employment he saidecopetrol needs to increase efficiency in heavy crude oils currently heavy crude represents more than half of the countrys oil production and ecopetrol data show that the proportion of conventional crude sweet or light will decrease in the next  years from  to  and from   to  while the total of unconventional heavy crude will increase from  to  of total production for this reason according to the union despite the fact that the exploitation potential of these resources is great in the country since there are reserves of  million barrels equivalent there are considerable challenges in infrastructure technology human talent and supplies the high viscosity and density of this crude oil requires additional thermal and chemical treatments for its effective extraction which despite the technological advances that have already taken place still leaves a recovery factor on a world average of around  when in conventional wells is  said jose luis langer campetrols sector analyst in addition although in the past the use of naphtha allowed ecopetrol to improve the production of heavy crude oils such as castilla blend from  to  barrels per day for the apiayporvenir pipeline this strategy continues to be inefficient compared to the unconventional exploitation potential that it has this potential which according to the study occurs both in the reserves concentrated in the llanos magdalena medio and putumayo basin especially in the rubiales apiay ombu castilla san fernando teca nare and jazmin fields  as in the fields of foreign companies that have the experience and innovation and are working on hybrid technologies in pipeline transportation lubricated flow and emulsionsin one installment ecopetrol transfers   million in dividends to its minority shareholders the payment per share will be   and according to the company a shareholder who has a package of  shares will receive   in a single cash while that of the nation   billion the majority shareholder will be drawn in  installments as of october    adding to all shareholders the dividends to be distributed by ecopetrol will total   trillion as a result of the distribution of  of the profits obtained in  for the oil company it is important to note that the people who bought ecopetrol shares in  when the first issuance was made they have already received   in dividends including this year which means that they will have already recovered  of their investment ecopetrol also reminds shareholders that if dividends are not claimed they will not generate any type of return between the date set for payment and the date the shareholder decides to collect them the payment of dividends is made through your direct depositor that is the stock brokerage company according to the form you have chosen credit to your bank account or payment in cash or check additionally in a press release the company reported that the risk rating agency fitch ratings maintained ecopetrols foreign and local currency rating at bbb and bbb  respectively likewise the credit agency reaffirmed the national longterm rating at aaa col and the national shortterm rating at   col all ratings maintain their stable outlook according to fitch ecopetrols ratings reflect its solid financial profile and improved production levels ecopetrols recently revised growth strategy and associated capital investments are considered adequate for the creditworthiness of the company ecopetrol is expected to maintain a financial and credit profile consistent with the assigned ratings ecopetrol minority shareholders begin to receive   million from today it should be remembered that the meeting at its meeting on march  approved the distribution of an ordinary dividend of   per share minority investors will receive this dividend in a single installment however so far the stock has not been affected since so far it has risen  to  new attack against ecopetrol infrastructure pollutes rivers in narino according to the oil company the attack caused the pipeline to break and the oil spill over the pianulpi stream which supplies the guisa river and this in turn to the mira river that feeds the tumaco aqueduct at the time of the attack the pipeline was operating and pumping was immediately suspended so far the company has installed five barriers to contain the spill one of them at the aqueduct intake and the other four in the gualtal pinde llorente and vaquerio villages company crews with workers and equipment have also been deployed to attend to this new contingency and prevent the stain from reaching the mira rivercost of producing a barrel at ecopetrol is us   the second highest in the region thus when comparing stateowned companies in the region ecopetrol ranks second in lifting costs per barrel with us   in first place is petroamazonas with us   and in third place petrobras with us   the first reason that explains the lack of efficiency is that there is a deficit in transportation infrastructure which leads to several trips being made by tank car which increases costs up to three times additionally the roads in these areas are not of great relevance so for example in the eastern plains they can only mobilize crews and drills between december and april as the heavy rains the rest of the year prevent access he explains the acp report in the second instance environmental procedures not only take about  months three times longer than in the united kingdom twice as long as in brazil and up to seven times what mexicans take but also the cost of processing to build a well production can be between   million and   billion there are even analysts who assure that the estimate is timid since it is necessary to add up the costs of processing permits for forest use and water concessions  furthermore in the case of mature fields the cost of treating each barrel of water exceeds us   and can reach up to us   finally the costs of relations with the communities last year meant that it stopped producing  barrels of oil which according to the national hydrocarbons agency anh were losses of us   million a dayecopetrol places an  bond for us   million colombian oil company ecopetrol on tuesday placed a us   billion  bond with a yield of  or  basis points over comparable us treasury papers ifr a thomson reuters financial information service published on tuesday ecopetrol announced that it will issue us   billion  bonds with this move the company seeks capital to make investments the news agency said ecopetrol would sell the securities to obtain yields of about  which would be above us treasury bonds that would have the same maturity said a person familiar with the negotiation who is not authorized to speak on the subject and asked not to be identified said the publication in addition he stressed that according to the information reported by the united states regulators the banks credit suisse ag and hsbc holdings would be working on the sale recently the rating agency fitch ratings indicated that it maintained ecopetrols foreign and local currency rating at bbb and bbb  respectively additionally in the case of the national longterm and shortterm rating the rating agency also kept them at aaa col and   col ecopetrols ratings reflect its solid financial profile and improved production levels ecopetrols recently revised growth strategy and associated capital investments are considered adequate for the creditworthiness of the company ecopetrol is expected to maintain a financial and credit profile consistent with the assigned ratings fitch said in the report that was replicated in a statement from the oil companyecopetrol grupo bolivar nutresa and exito believe in music as csr among the companies that lead the support of these foundations either with money or by providing some type of goods and services are ecopetrol cine colombia gas natural fenosa the ministry of culture grupo bolivar the foreign ministry nutresa gases de occidente grupo exito promigas banco de bogota and others which have the common goal of providing new life opportunities to the countrys children and youth we see a very important social background because the children who are part of the different musical orchestras are not on the streets or linked in bad steps they also know about music which can be a life project for them said the conductor of the batuta orchestras juan pablo valencia precisely one of the foundations that leads musical projects in colombia is batuta which since  has been working on music promotion throughout the country and invests between   and   million annually which are destined

musical training music for reconciliation the border plan and the strengthening of the network of orchestras of which the initiatives that are handled throughout the country are deployed such as the orchestras choirs projects on the borders of venezuela brazil ecuador and more another of the leading entities in these projects is the bolivar davivienda foundation which has its support in the young philharmonic of colombia where it manages an investment of   billion and is supported mainly by the bolivar group the ministry of culture the foreign ministry  rcn semana magazine and the federation of national coffee growers for fernando cortes mcallister director of the foundation the most important thing is that the children see in these programs new possibilities for progress and they have as an example some people who left the foundation and have succeeded or have won scholarships to study in the outside in cali about  children participate in the peace notes foundation programs directed by gloria guzman who says that in july  new members will join notes of peace was born in the bellavista neighborhood where there were children in a condition of vulnerability due to violence that is why they study half a day that is complemented by college studies capturing all the free space that children and young people have said guzman  for its part the exito foundation will invest   million for musical initiation programs since its biggest bet is focused on nutrition the important thing for us is the development that children have at a young age in discipline teamwork and knowing how to listen said the director of the german jaramillo foundation in the eight musical programs that are run in medellin pereira and armenia there are about  children under the age of  who are at an appropriate age to start their first notions of sensitivity to the world said the director among the companies that invest in the foundation grupo exito is the one that contributes the most however they have strategic alliances with the sinfonica de antioquia which supports them with experts and teachers rhythm is not just for children not all foundations are focused on children and young people the fosbo foundation that works with the bogota symphony orchestra has about  people linked to the project in its program our focus is not dedicated to the child population because we believe that there are already several entities that work with this type of public said the executive director of fosbo adam zajac according to the official website of the foundation the sponsors for  were lufthansa grodco s en c and the united states embassy who were interested in the  projects of the foundation that works only in the city of bogota opinions fernando cortes mcallister director of the

environmental and social damage in four departments of the country and that have been attributed to the groups outside the law the companys workers regardless of payroll demand the immediate cessation of attacks that put the lives of direct officials contractors and people from the communities that work and live around the operations of the industry in norte de santander narino at risk  putumayo and arauca  says the statement it also insists that ecopetrol and the uso consider these acts that threaten the civilian population especially vulnerable communities unacceptable they impede access to essential public services such as water they violate the right to life work and free movement and they affect the environment in areas that are recognized as being some of the richest in biodiversity

ecopetrol and the other two oil companies that are traded on the stock market pacific rubiales and canacol are feeling the rigors of the increase in the dollar   at the close of the working day all the actions were in negative territory he added at  am ecopetrols share recovered and its average price was   on june  it fell to  ecopetrol suspended pumping and activated a contingency plan in orito in this sense he assured that technicians from the oil company wait for the army to examine the area and rule out the presence of other explosive devices to begin repair and cleaning work additionally he assured that the spilled hydrocarbon was deposited in two containment points previously located by ecopetrol as a contingency measure for another attack in this sector thus avoiding affecting the acae river and guamuez river the situation was reported to the relevant local authorities corpoamazonia and the municipal council for risk and disaster management so that in coordinated work normality can be restored in the area for its part corpoamazonia announced that it will visit the site to make an initial assessment of the environmental impacts but they are waiting for the public force to secure the areaecopetrol workers await due to changes in structure as reported by the company what it is doing is not cutting personnel in the same way that there are no massive layoffs but the presidency gave the order that due to the fall in oil prices and the cut in state finances the areas would have to make several adjustments to make the structures lighter that is the departments would be simplified to leave only the people who were necessary thus there have been terminations of contracts for third and fourth level managers and other workers without the socalled just cause according to edwin castano president of the union sindical obrera uso most of these cases occur in the south of the country we do not know what the reason is what they do is deliver very laconic statements where they are thanked for their time in the company and a dismissal without just cause he said however these have not been the only workers who have left the company according to several firstline managers that is to say from the companys vice presidencies their contracts have also been terminated or they have been transferred some having been with the company for about  years according to the oil company this is something that normally happens when a new administration enters there are changes in managers and people arrive with whom the president juan carlos echeverry wants to work for castano although he considers that a new administration is well liked the organization still does not know the purposes for which they are being done which leads to various speculations that the company is being given a political tinge among the executives who have been fired are ayde mar ramirez the companys director of labor relations in addition the social management department ended so maria tonneli also retired other movements which occurred on the same day were the departure of engineer pedro rosales who was vice president of the refinery and lasted  years at the state company and the retirement of federico maya vice president at reficar finally the departure of andres pavia who was director of industrial security occurred according to the company for pension reasons today there are people in charge but the hiring process that echeverry will decide at the time he sees fit is underwayattacks against oil infrastructure in putumayo and narino are rejected by ecopetrol once the incident occurred ecopetrol together with the military forces activated the contingency plans to ensure the entry of the technicians in charge of carrying out the respective repairs ecopetrol regretted these new attacks with which  have already been completed against its oil infrastructure so far this year which not only affect the environment and impede the development of oil activities the company saidecopetrol and epm awaiting board approval to close the invercolsa business according to the information that became known the idea that the oil company has and that it has analyzed the best option to carry out the sale is to make an interadministrative agreement with the other state company to sell the shares this administrative agreement is an exception that is made in article  of law  of  which governs the processes of these sales and indicates that the share transfer that is carried out between state bodies does not conform to the procedure provided in this law but only the current administrative contracting rules will be applied  in this way what ecopetrol carried out was a kind of round where it called the state companies that might be interested in the shares and offered them of these the only one that remained and that seems to be analyzing the proposal very seriously including the purchase of the disputed shares is epm that when contacted by lr preferred not to comment yet however according to jose roberto acosta professor at cesa this operation would be wonderful for the paisa company since due to the companys portfolio the assets in which invercolsa invests would strengthen them in the supply of gas it is good to remember that within the stock portfolio of the company for sale are investments in companies such as alcanos metrogas and gases del caribe among others additionally there would be another benefit from selling the stake in this way and not putting it in the long current disposal process as occurred with eeb and isa which took about three years an administrative agreement would expedite the sale and in this way ecopetrol would have the resources more quickly it is estimated that under this mechanism it would take only three to four months to close the deal finally the valuation of the company which is close to us   million in books will be the result of the process carried out by the investment banks that will accompany the process control bonus and shares of fernando londono another mess that is solved with the interadministrative sale is that of the shares in dispute in the fernando londono case currently the constitutional court has already issued two rulings in favor of ecopetrol and it would be close to ending but the process could last more than a year so if the shares are put up for sale by law  the process would require two stages and by not putting  ecopetrol would lose the control premium which is an additional  or  that epm would pay for having more than  participation and that would be included in the current agreement opinions jose roberto acosta professor of the cesa for epm it would be a monona and a wonderful agreement since they would strengthen services of which they are market leaders diego franco corredor de varolta everything that for ecopetrol is not a strategic asset and is sold the market sees it with good eyes more than it could have a very good price luis

ecopetrol lost  spots on the fortune list of the  most valuable companies according to the data exposed by fortune ecopetrols fall on the list is mainly due to the  drop that the company has had in its revenues in the last year and the  drop in its profits in the global ranking the first place was occupied by wallmart which kept the position occupied in  mainly due to strengths such as its large number of stores in the united states and its ability to compete for prices the second place was taken by sinopec group of china and the third place went to the royal dutch shellecopetrol denounces

the country and that area with the completion of the contract the royalties generated by these fields will go from  to  of basic production as established by law the companies explained in a joint statement these fields will be the last to which the contract ends this year but the markets and workers of pacific rubiales remain attentive to the decisions of the ecopetrol board of directors on who will carry out the operations in campo rubiales which will expire the contract on june  of the following year and where splicing works have already been carried out between the companies it is good to remember that all these fields are considered mature which is why they have had several declines in their production however if ecopetrol begins to use techniques such as horizontal hydraulic

crossing a  sheet of water the well reached the target at  meters below mean sea level where a net gasbearing sand interval of between  to  meters  to  feet whose technical parameters are being evaluated by the integrated teams of anadarko and ecopetrol we are pleased to make this important announcement with our partner anadarko the kronos discovery adds to the one made last december in the  well located in deep waters of the tayrona block off the coast of la guajira where we are partners of petrobras repsol and statoil  said the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry likewise he highlighted that these results are of great relevance and confirm the potential of the colombian caribbean oil system in a wide area and are aligned with ecopetrols new strategy in which one of the focuses is exploration in marine basins of high potential in  the ecopetrolanadarko consortium began exploration of the southern sector of the colombian caribbean in the fuerte norte fuerte sur   and purple angel blocks anadarko is one of the most recognized companies in the world for its experience in the exploration of hydrocarbons and the execution of projects in deep and ultradeep waters it is currently developing the largest seismic campaign in the history of the colombian caribbean with an area of more than  thousand square kilometers once the activities in  are completed the bolette dolphin a stateoftheart drilling equipment used in this operation will move to the fuerte norte block to continue drilling the  well located  kilometers northeast of kronos for now kronos  continues to be drilled to reach a deeper target to determine possible new resultscerrejon and ecopetrol increase capital for technology at ecopetrol for example the budget accumulated in the last  years in technological investments was close to us   million while the economic benefits leveraged by the application of innovative solutions reached us   million explained nestor fernando saavedra vice president of innovation and technology of ecopetrol for its part cerrejon this year alone an investment of approximately us   million is estimated said roberto junguito president of cerrejon although it does not have a unified figure for its investment it maintains that it contemplates both economic physical and human resources that allow it to promote innovation aimed at optimizing processes a few years ago none of these companies would have thought that the technology would advance so far until the extraction processes would become easier faster and safer thus technology allows experimenting with new forms of exploration and production which in addition to reducing operating costs gives the possibility of increasing productivity levels although according to francisco lloreda president of acp there is no consolidated statement of how much colombian companies invest in innovation and technology it is clear that many see their future more prosperous thanks to them it is the parent companies that make these investments thus ecopetrol seeks in investments to add value to the business chain through the management of industrial assets knowledge innovation and technology in  ecopetrol proposed a new extraction technology for the country which consisted of injecting hot air below the fields an innovation that allowed it to increase its production capacity as the oil comes out more liquid to the surface in  the budget executed by the company was us   and in  the investment was us   million according to saavedra the company has planned alliances to accelerate the incorporation of technologies as well as to advance in the development and adaptation of smart field technologies reservoir modeling with geophysical and advanced computing techniques technologies for integrated field operation among others thus oil and mining companies continue to bet on new forms of exploitation that allow them to save costs research is the boom of companies investment in innovation is translated into research and development projects as well as specialized technical assistance where technological support during the drilling of exploratory wells technological solutions for treatment and transportation stands out of heavy crude oil energy integration in fields specialized technical assistance for well stimulation and sand control among others the opinions nestor fernando saavedra vice innovation and tech ecopetrol increasing the recovery factor is the most important strength that ecopetrol develops roberto junguito president cerrejon we make investments to maintain our operation and achieve optimization of resourcesthe ecopetrol building in the icp piedecuesta cost more than   million the structure cost about   million and generated more than  direct and indirect jobs in the region this work houses the colombian petroleum institute icp according to the architect liliana valencia giraldo a professional in the icps maintenance and infrastructure area the design and construction implemented the norms standards and sustainability philosophies required to achieve an infrastructure that allows operating safely and efficiently among the buildings characteristics are explosionproof equipment in classified areas together with a precise control and monitoring system designed to reduce energy consumption to the maximum and maintain air purity for the comfort and wellbeing of the personnel the structure also has a helipad on the roof whose design verified by real testing allows landings and takeoffs without major problems due to vibration and noise the roof has passable green spaces of about  square meters which according to the company reduce the heat generated by the sun on the roof of the maintenance block which optimizes energy consumption the internal lighting is activated and deactivated by motion sensors allowing real and effective energy savings for its part the rainwater drainage system stores up to  cubic meters of the liquid which will serve to supply water to the sanitation services the multipurpose building includes a sample reception center for ecopetrol and its subsidiaries workshops for the maintenance of equipment associated with research within the laboratories storage warehouses for hydrocarbon samples and their derivatives cold rooms and conference rooms with cutting edge technology the construction had a multidisciplinary team in areas such as civil electrical mechanical instrumentation and control engineering the technology of the multipurpose structure the planning of the building was done using bim building information modeling technology the different specialists of the work team have shared data worked from that data performed preconstruction analysis simulation and used these results to anticipate the solution to problems that may arise in the work in addition there was a  to  compensation for tree fellingecopetrol makes the first sale of two million barrels of crude oil to japan according to the company the cargo will be dispatched from the port of covenas in the second half of august and should arrive approximately  days later at port kiire in southern japan the japanese company jx nippon is an oil company that belongs to the jx holdings group which is engaged in the refining and marketing of oil and petrochemical products as well as the import and sale of gas and coal the supply of electricity and the manufacture and commercialization of solar energy cells and storage batteries for ecopetrol reaching the japanese market is a great opportunity since this export can open the door to a future constant agreement to supply heavy crude directly to the jx holdings group especially when it is in high demand because it has a refining capacity of  million barrels per day in seven refineries to reach this purchase agreement jx nippon was in talks with ecopetrol throughout the first half of this this is in addition to the sale of a month ago that the company made for one million barrels to south koreawhat to expect from ecopetrol in the second quarter analysts agreed that for the months of april may and june growth will not be important due to the attacks on the oil infrastructure and the slight increase in the value of a barrel of oil however they were positive with the results after three years for jose david lopez director of strategy and economic analysis at valoralta asesorias e inversiones the second quarter of  will continue to be in the doldrums for ecopetrol it must be remembered that in the same period last year the price of brent was located at us   it currently stands at us   average so there is a considerable decrease  the expert ventured to give figures and calculated that the oil company will have profits close to   billion in the second quarter he recalled that for the three months of  the item was   billion a drop of  in one year was calculated the first quarter of this year gave profits of   million with a barrel of oil at approximately   he added daniel escobar director of the strategy department of global securities has a profit calculation similar to that of lopez the profits will be   billion the factors that play in favor will be the wealth tax which they already put in the first period also that there was an increase in the price of oil of   for his part juan felipe pinzon strategy and markets analyst at profesionales de bolsa assured that they are expecting a slight recovery in the aforementioned time this in relation to what was registered in the first three months of  the above said pinzon taking into account the recovery in crude prices between april and june which escobar also mentioned the barrel went on average from us   to us   increasing  despite the slight rebound pinzon believes that the results will be weak the constant attacks that the infrastructure has suffered at the hands of the guerrilla groups will also have their responsibility in the weakness of the figures in general  will be a very weak year for ecopetrol and it will show significantly lower income compared to  he said for shareholders who are concerned about the situation of the stock experts say that it is not the best time to sell since the title is at egg price yesterday for example it closed at   according to the strategy and markets analyst at profesionales de bolsa the stock could be located in the next few days at   and at the end of the year at   if brent continues to rise the investments made in ecopetrol are for the long term i recommend to shareholders not to sell because for  a share could be seen at    the projection of the recovery of the stock in three years would be based on the fact that this is the same time that economic cycles last which go through boom depression and recovery the highest price of the share was   in  the oil companys share is far from the good run that it went through three years ago when in may  it reached its highest price of   although the forecast for  looks good it would not reach even   the history of the share also shows that the minimum value of the share was   in january  a year marked by the global economic crisis the price of the first issue was   and that same day it reached   the opinions juan felipe pinzon strategy and markets analyst of stock market professionals the investments made in ecopetrol are for the long term i recommend to shareholders not to sell because by the end of  a share of   could be seen  jose david lopez director of strategy and economic analysis at valoralta the firm is going to have profits close to   billion in the second quarter it must be remembered that for the same period in  the item was   billion ecopetrol started the renovation of barrancabermeja the objective is to do a complete maintenance for one month of the unit to achieve a sixyear running cycle and thus reach its maximum load capacity and update its main equipment to receive heavier crude oils as the company explains this will not affect work or production the importance of this unit is that it represents  of the refinerys crude load as reported by ecopetrol the contracting firm in charge of executing these works committed to a strict schedule we have defined logistics selection and training strategies for human talent as well as the incorporation of technological solutions that aim to comply with the  mechanical days said a spokesperson for the turnarounds company in charge of executing the shutdown the scope of the works to be carried out includes the general maintenance of seven towers change of  tons of pipe and the wiring and control system of the unit the stop has been scheduled following ecopetrols processes and standards with a setup that included strategies for the delivery of equipment erection of scaffolding installation of trays and polycables delivery of work permits prestart security cleaning of equipment and training to operators among others  explained orlando diaz general manager of the barrancabermeja refinery first sale to japan in line with the strategy of diversifying the destination of products and entering asian markets ecopetrol will make its first shipment of crude oil to japan after closing a negotiation with the japanese company jx nippon which acquired  million crude castilla to supply its refineries the cargo will be dispatched from the port of covenas in the second half of august and should arrive approximately  days later at port kiire in southern japan according to the schedule for ecopetrol reaching the japanese market is a great opportunity since this export can open the door to a future constant agreement to supply heavy crude directly to the jx holdings group the complete modernization was postponed it is good to remember that the president of the state company juan carlos echeverry explained that the complete modernization project was going to be postponed and it was also going to be carried out in parts since the situation did not allow the company to carry out these operations however he pointed out that it was absolutely necessary for barranca to adapt to refine heavier crudes ensuring profitability and value generation in the medium and long term as part of the companys strategy for ecopetrol announced that the water in the municipality of ocana was free of crude oil through a statement the ecopetrol company reported that today at  am the results of the samples taken by the uis at the intake of the aqueduct that supplies ocana were known the results showed that the water which in the next few days would reach the homes of this population is suitable for human consumption and that there is no presence of hydrocarbons the mayor of ocana jesus antonio sanchez confirmed the information sent by ecopetrol on his twitter account listen today there will be two more samples and then it will be the municipal risk management council which decides when the intake will open on the other hand the oil company affirmed that  tank trucks have been supplied to transport more than two million liters of water from the algodonal river at the point known as la trituradora to the espo sa water treatment plant with two more tank trucks drinking water is supplied to the health network the prison and other highpriority institutionsecopetrols profit in the second quarter fell  and reached   trillion ecopetrols sales revenue during this period decreased  from   billion in  to   billion between april and june the company explained that this is due to a lower price of the grupo empresarial crude oil basket which subtracted   million from the total the devaluation of the exchange rate with which total revenues improved by   million and higher sales volumes mainly in crude oil exported due to the greater availability of the transportation system during  oil production in the second quarter reached  barrels equivalent per day in line with the goal of  barrels equivalent per day announced for  and with an increase of  compared to production in the second quarter of  reported the company ebitda decreased  to   trillion and the ebitda margin was  compared to  in the second quarter of  ecopetrols president juan carlos echeverri highlighted the decrease in costs in this period the company disciplinedly continues its cost adjustment program in different areas a program that sees its efforts materialize in   million saved these savings are mainly derived from renegotiations with contractors which have meant the strengthening of our longterm relationships and the understanding on the part of our allies that these circumstances call for extraordinary actions as well as a mutual commitment to mitigate the effects of this scenario of falling prices sales and recovery of the price of a barrel raised ecopetrols profit to   billion this on the one hand is a good surprise to the market which was expecting the companys earnings to be below   trillion for camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones the figures are positive since they are explained to a greater extent by an improvement in the level of sales and a large reduction in costs however there is still very worrying data on production exploration and company debt in sales exports increased  to  barrels of oil equivalent due to higher foreign sales to japan and the east coast of the us fuel oil sales to asia also increased bringing total sales to totaled   trillion surpassing those of the first quarter on the side of cost reduction in which the president of the company juan carlos echeverry rescued the decrease in   million silva pointed out that it is positive although some amounts are missing that could alleviate the burden on the company in addition he indicated that he is concerned that within the  decrease in operating expenses the  drop in exploration expenses is mainly observed due to less seismic activity and fewer drilling campaigns what caused that no activity was carried out in the period it is a worrying data because the future of the oil companies depends on the generation of reserves and at this moment ecopetrol does not have more he said a comment with which several experts in the sector agree who explain that companies should immediately start exploring since what has not been sown cannot be collected even more so when tougher periods are forecast for the company starting in the following semester when the attacks on infrastructure will possibly be affected to a greater extent and when the result of a new drop in the barrel of oil will be felt finally production during the second quarter of  showed an increase of  compared to the same period of  and stood at  barrels of oil equivalent per day market analysts did not see this as a great success for the company since compared to the first half of the year and in turn compared to the end of  there has been a downward trend that is worrying even more so when  investments of the company us   million are destined to increase production the greatest defense against falling prices increase in debt and the recovery factor for analysts the increase in the companys debt is worrying especially at this time and they hope that not only will no more issues be made but that in the next delivery of profits the government will have the company takes into account more than the nation and a percentage is distributed more in line with the situation faced with the recovery factor it is expected that the advances of the new pilots will be known and begin to give results opinions juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol in financial matters we had a better quarter due to the fact that the prices of crude oil and products showed an increasing trend along with the exchange rateecopetrol expects the cartagena refinery to operate at one hundred percent in march  the entry into operation of the cartagena refinery reficar is considered by analysts and government officials as a driving factor in their growth forecasts for the fourth largest economy in latin america which faces a slowdown as a result of the fall in oil prices we expect to have the refinery at one hundred percent by march at the latest beginning sometime in the third quarter that is yet to be defined said juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol in a conference call with investors once the modernization project is completed with investments exceeding us   billion the  refinery located on the caribbean sea will have a loading capacity of  barrels per day up from  barrels per day in the past with the entry into operation of reficar colombia is expected to reduce its imports of diesel and gasoline the main refinery in colombia is barrancabermeja located in the department of santander which has a production capacity of  barrels per dayis a new ecopetrol lawsuit brewing against pacific rubiales in this case the new problem and for which ecopetrol would be analyzing taking measures is based on a  document from the comptrollers office which states that the state company would be detrimental for receiving the barrels in kind and not in money the entity in the notice it delivered to ecopetrol explained that the fiscal detriment would be for a preliminary value of us   million and that although pacific has been delivering the barrels to ecopetrol these should be valued or recalculated at market prices corresponding to the dates on which they were generated  thus and according to sources close to lr the companies have had several meetings in order to reach an agreement for pacific to pay the prices owed for this crude and ecopetrol to benefit from the contract however and despite the fact that ecopetrol did not comment when consulted sources close to the process indicate that the state company would already be analyzing various actions if an agreement was not reached among these a lawsuit against the canadianecopetrol launches corporate vice president of strategy and finance among her functions suarez will be in charge of complying with the relevant information in front of the financial superintendence of colombia and international markets as well as integrating planning

reported in the budget   million the company has   million that have already shown impacts but in order to reach the proposed goal of   trillion and achieve the remaining   million the oil company has five main actions the first is through the result of vit negotiations with which   million will be saved projected savings from supply strategies of   million potential savings reported not closed for   million projected savings of   million from nonnegotiated contracts and finally    million that will be the result of negotiations of energy contracts which will have an immediate impact finally echeverry explained that the reductions will be made throughout the companys production chain which will make each segment more competitiveecopetrol authorized the creation of a subsidiary to manage the offshore free zones according to a statement from the oil company the subsidiary seeks to develop offshore activities in colombia which the company currently has as operator and nonoperator and take advantage of the benefits of decree  by which conditions and requirements are established for the declaration of the existence of permanent offshore free zones  so far this is the first step to create this company after this happens authorization will be requested from the national hydrocarbons agency anh to assign the contractual position of ecopetrol sa in offshore exploration and production contracts in the blocks in which it is an operator and a nonoperatorwith a new subsidiary ecopetrol seeks to exploit free zones the idea of the company is to take advantage of the benefits of the free zone decree that was issued in december of the previous year  so that the capital and investments that are being made in these places are more efficient according to the oil company statement the subsidiary seeks to develop offshore activities in colombia which the company currently has as operator and nonoperator such as kronos orca calasu and new wells near la guajira and thus take advantage of the benefits of decree  which establishes conditions and requirements for the declaration of the existence of permanent offshore free zones  the next steps for the oil company will be to establish the conditions of this new company following this authorization will be requested from the national hydrocarbons agency anh to assign ecopetrols contractual position in offshore exploration and production contracts in the blocks in which it is an operator and a nonoperator according to the company in these times it is necessary to make the limited resources that companies in the sector have viable in the best way possible to develop deposits that are  times more expensive under these conditions in addition to advancing the evaluation and delimitation wells of the discoveries that have already been made offshore in the decree in addition to tax incentives it is also established that free zones can be created without the need for closures in offshore territories to exploit hydrocarbons after obtaining the respective contract for the area assigned by anh furthermore for gustavo lorenzo tax director of ey colombia frank regimes allow investors to enter capital goods for oil exploitation without tariffs or vat have a reduced rental rate of  among others thus for the colombian case it is interesting because the normal rental rate can be reduced by  plus a cree rate and a cree surcharge obviously reducing this tax burden is interesting he said with this ecopetrol hopes to boost investments in these areas which can represent important resources for the national economy turning into an invaluable opportunity to generate income and jobsecopetrols share hit a new low and traded below its issue price at this time the share of the oil company is at   and presents a decrease in its trading price of  compared to the close of the day on friday which was   the highest price registered on the day was   and the lowest was   the volume traded is   millionecopetrol and jx nippon establish an alliance to explore an offshore block in brazil it is good to remember that the colombian stateowned company had the exclusive rights to the block that had been awarded to it in round  of the national oil gas and biofuels agency of brazil anp in may  but now in the search to reduce the risks and improve investments ecopetrol is looking for partners to continue exploring the commercial agreement which is in the process of being approved by the anp establishes that jx nippon will join the exploration of the area with a  stake both for exploratory investments and for resources that could be discovered in this way ecopetrol will keep  of the interests and will continue as operator this alliance with jx nippon is in line with our new strategy that seeks to position ourselves as a panamerican company with growing offshore exploration in colombia the gulf of mexico and brazil at the same time that we diversify risk by allying with class companies worldwide said the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry finally ecopetrol explained that jx nippon is a company with interests in north america the north sea malaysia and vietnam with great knowledge in exploration which will allow it to design in the best way the  square kilometer seismic acquisition program of the block block  is in the first phase of the fiveyear exploratory period in brazil ecopetrol also participates in block  in the ceara basin in association with chevron the operating company with a  stake and in block  in the potiguar basinecopetrol establishes an alliance for an offshore block in brazil it is good to remember that the colombian state company had the exclusive rights to the block that had been awarded to it in round  of the national agency for oil gas and biofuels of brazil anp in may  but now with the price situation in order to reduce risks ecopetrol decided to choose a partner to make these investments the agreement which is in the process of being approved by the anp establishes that jx nippon will join the exploration with a  stake both for exploratory investments and for resources that could be discovered in this way ecopetrol will keep  of the interests and will continue as operator this alliance is in line with our new strategy that seeks to position ourselves as a panamerican company with growing offshore exploration in colombia the gulf of mexico and brazil while diversifying risk by allying with worldclass companies said the president juan carlos echeverryecopetrol enabled two tanks in covenas the investment to carry out this first part of the project is   million and was made in the development of the intervention project for the crude transportation system between the ayacucho station in cesar and the port of covenas in sucre in addition before the end of this year another two tanks will come into operation in the same maritime terminal with which the company will be able to store up to  million barrels of crude there the total investment in the placement of the four tanks reaches   million in addition the firm calculated that the region in which these adjustments are being developed has benefited from the creation of  direct and indirect jobs related to the initiative to locate the new storage tanks ecopetrol explained that it was necessary to dismantle four tanks built more than  years ago with a capacity of  barrels each and instead build the four new ones in addition to the facilities and adjustments necessary for their correct operation thanks to these new adjustments the covenas maritime terminal is now able to support the cartagena facilities in the production of fuel oil this according to the oil firm translates into process optimization and therefore in greater economic benefits for cenit and ecopetrol proof of this optimization is that since these adjustments began to be put into operation in march of this year up to two monthly shipments of low viscosity fuel oil have been exported of  barrels each these new exports represent  of ecopetrols sales abroad and its main markets have been singapore europe and the united states where the product is being used to carry out the manufacture of fuels that are used in the operation of appliances and marine vehicles profitability over volume company philosophy faced with the fall in international oil prices ecopetrols technical vice president rafael guzman explained during the xvi oil and gas congress that the companys new philosophy is to set its production goals in terms of profitability of the projects and not in volumes produced now we must focus on creating value selecting the best projects to invest in producing profitable barrels emphasizing sustainability through the incorporation of reserves he saidecopetrols production could fall by up to  in the first half of  in fact it is expected that in the first half of  according to calculations by some oil unions production could decrease between  and  due to the decline in some fields  however according to ecopetrols strategy this was already contemplated since efficient barrels will be prioritized above the volumetric level so the key to a good or bad  will be in cost reduction now the situation will be temporary and with a strong investment by the company in increasing the recovery factor which they expect to improve  that is to reach  the recovery of the volume will take place for the second half of the year  for camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones it will then be essential for the company that production costs continue to be reduced at the price of a barrel since in this way with more efficient barrels the profit from the sale of each one will generate what is no longer received due to production so far the company has reduced production costs between  and  which has allowed it to generate buffers in much broader savings explained diego franco a financial analyst however for alejandro martinez founder of amv consultants in order for this to continue in  the measures that the government integrates of a fundamental tax nature will be essential to help reduce operating costs in the country since with the current measures although they are positive there continues to be strong pressure on companies now in terms of refining the news is waiting for the timetable for reficars entry to be fulfilled according to ecopetrol it has a startup of  and would start in march which would allow costs to be reduced by an additional  after the first quarter in addition it will allow the country to stop imports of acpm which currently represent about  of total consumption in the same way it would stop the imports that have had to be made of gasoline due to the cessation of activities of the refinery for a year and all the fuel that the country demands would be produced again which would also increase income finally in terms of exploration despite the strategy of alliances to explore offshore and in other countries which has allowed ecopetrol to manage risk levels and have more comfortable cash flows it is still waiting for that the associations take place within the country which according to the president of the state juan carlos echeverry would begin the next few months thus and if the expected changes occur stock brokers expect that the share by the end of  could be between   and   administrative changes and dividends so far the new leadership of ecopetrol and its board of directors have been well liked by shareholders however they are still waiting for changes to be made within their positions it is good to remember that with the resignation of gonzalo restrepo the independent members of the board are jorge gabino pinzon luis fernando ramirez carlos cure cure joaquin moreno horacio ferreira representative of producer departments and roberto steiner representative of minority shareholders faced with dividends it is also planned for  that the participation it delivers will be reduced according to comments from some executives opinions alejandro martinez founding partner of amv consultores ecopetrol is doing what all the oil companies are doing and it is correct now it is essential that the government take the necessary tax measures  ruben dario lizarralde president of campetrol whoever evaluates the investment observes that offshore exploration will obtain results within  years and without onshore ecopetrol remains without reserves in the medium termecopetrol may bid for brazilian blocks the national petroleum agency assured that  companies were admitted to participate in the bid for oil exploration this process will be done in october in addition the agency informed that the selected companies are from  other countries where british petroleum stands out exxonmobil and the brazilian petrobras in total  blocks will be offered in  sectorsnational government approves sale of ecopetrol shares in isa currently ecopetrols shareholding in isa amounts to  ordinary shares which is equivalent to  of the subscribed and paid shares the price per share for the first stage of the program aimed at recipients of special conditions will be   per share as stipulated in the decree that approves the disposal program the government also confirmed that the proceeds from the sale will be used for ecopetrols general corporate purposes including financing its investment planmarulanda and linares two imminent changes in the leadership of ecopetrol likewise it was learned that the governments candidate for the constitutional court is alejandro linares who serves as ecopetrols legal vice president although the communications management had denied to lr that these changes were going to take place at the top of the company the rumors of both exits are very strong it is even said that marulanda is one of the main candidates to lead the avianca airline and it is speculated that linares is only waiting for a nod from the government to resign and join the shortlist with these two changes there would already be nine main executives of the firm who have changed their position since the arrival of juan carlos echeverry at present the only thing missing is the completion of the hiring process for the new vice president of refining a position held by pedro rosales navarro and in which today as manager is orlando diaz montoya manager of the barrancabermeja refinery among the other changes that were made was the merger of the financial vice presidency with that of strategy and growth which was in charge of maria fernanda suarez consequently magda masonalva will continue to support the strengthening of the supply processes while adriana echeverri migrated to ecopetrol america a subsidiary located in houston united states the vice presidency of compliance was also created the area in charge of auditing and ethics this department is led by juliana alban who was previously in the attorney generals office engineer jaime bocanegra remained in the vicepresidency of transport and logistics who was previously in the vicepresidency of sustainable development a position held today by eduardo uribe who was vice minister of the environment in chess of ecopetrol would exchange for the government this executive will leave the oil company at the end of october after being with the firm for about  years according to ecopetrol the second to leave would be alejandro linares current legal vice president of the company who could be the governments candidate for a position in the high court the official would only be waiting for a signal from the palace to present his resignation and launch himself into the magistracy both exits have been heard for some months even from the moment in which juan carlos echeverry was appointed as the maximum head of the company as lr learned camilo marulanda presented echeverry with the resignation letter and it is also said that he is one of the main candidates to direct the avianca airline after fabio villegas retired two months ago from said entity but it also sounds like taking over the reins of the cartagena refinery regarding this ecopetrol had already assured lr that it was only a rumor marulanda as executive vice president was aware of several projects and subsidiaries including reficar but that company has its president and he would not be in his charge they said from the state company alvaro younes president of fedispetrol assured that marulanda would not be too big to take over the refinery although he warned that any

axes of ecopetrols strategy to increase reserves and production over the next few years  stated the president of the company juan carlos echeverry  the state company recalled that the cirainfantas is the oldest field in colombia it started its production in  within the socalled de mares concession whose reversal gave rise to ecopetrol in  it currently has  active wells of which  are producing and  inject water to increase the pressure in the reservoir and extract more crude in august ecopetrol already achieved a savings goal of   billion under this premise the goal that juan carlos echeverry president of the state company set for his officials this year was to exceed   billion however the goal was already achieved in august and now the new ceiling will exceed   billion in savings this was achieved as explained by the companys vice president of operation and development hector manosalva being more selective when choosing the projects to be executed emphasizing generating greater value as opposed to higher volume and the temporary suspension of projects with savings marginal in addition according to the executive ecopetrol has been developing a strategy to optimize its production costs that is beginning to pay off with the investment resources this allows us to maintain production levels at  barrels per day on average and contribute  production wells to the campaign of which  remain to be drilled which will allow us to meet the goal for  the strategy also includes the temporary suspension of contracts with suppliers that did not meet the price reduction criteria and the creation of an efficiency transformation program with personnel dedicated exclusively to increasing efficiency finally the incorporation of partners to make other assets technically and financially viable will take place in these months as echeverry had already reported  would have an environmental license in october the  well which has been considered one of the most important discoveries in the country in recent months currently produces  barrels per day in production tests and is awaiting of the environmental license to develop it according to hector manosalva vice president of

projections have also been decisive in this income said sol beatriz arango vice president of sustainability at grupo nutresa ecopetrol for its part recognizes that this index in the country has generated a certain competitiveness at the national level so that local companies challenge the issue of sustainability since in the end that is what will give visibility at the national level

measurement annually sends a questionnaire to companies to assess sustainability indices the interested company responds and attaches the corresponding evidences and supports to later send it to the international organization after a month of analysis robecosam delivers the numerical results of said measurement to each of the companies participating in the study in which a general score and a specific score are obtained for the different dimensions and determining evaluation criteria in the index opinions sol beatriz arango vice president of sustainability of grupo nutresa the

the number of shareholders from the moment of issuance until today there has been a stampede of natural investors of more than  which is a reflection of the economic situation in the country and the adverse circumstances of the companies said diego franco financial analyst and stockbroker according to information from the colombian stock exchange avianca made a share issue in  with an awarded amount of   million and a total of  million shares the price of each security was   back then but yesterday that same value closed at   reflecting a fall of    when this issuer hit the market it was going through a financial recovery which is why it was attractive to shareholders however the figures have not taken off in their entirety since  profits have been declining particularly in the first half of this year where there was a strong drop said orlando santiago jacome manager of fenix valor the expert added that this airline has borrowed heavily in dollars for operational reasons such as the renewal of the aircraft fleet it is a debt that is growing due to the current devaluation even if the income they receive in pesos remains fixed in the case of ecopetrol the main reason is the drop in oil prices the issuance of shares was made in  for an awarded amount of   billion and more than  million species each for an amount of   yesterday the title of the oil company closed at   a decrease of    crude prices have strongly hit the value of the share to this is added that reserves are not showing a substantial increase commented specialist franco on the other hand there is carvajal empaques which issued shares in  for an awarded amount of   million in more than  million titles with an individual value of   currently the species is worth   which represents a decrease of    this is because when the company went public it did so with the aim of reducing debt this is called destroying value and it has been reflected since then because they continue to show losses explained jacome those that have been valued among the species that have increased in value since their respective issuance is that of grupo sura which went from worth   in  to about   today this has to do according to experts with the acquisition of profitable companies there is also the title of banco davivienda which was at   and now reaches   for analysts this positive behavior is due to the fact that this entity is a dynamic player in the financial sector in the country and its penetration in the central american market oil yesterday registered its lowest price in history ecopetrols

most traded share yesterday with an amount of   million and a unit value of   grupo argos also stood out with a negotiation amount of   million the colcap index closed at  units with a decrease of  opinions orlando santiago jacome manager of fenix valor ecopetrol came to be considered a bubble in terms of action it was overvalued what happens today is that that bubble burst and in addition oil prices fell  diego franco stockbroker if you evaluate the number of shareholders from the moment of issuance until today there has been a clear stampede of natural investors of more than the second sale of ecopetrol shares in eeb began in this new stage the objective is to publicly offer in the country and abroad the shares that were not acquired by the recipients during the first stage which took place between may and july of this year said sale offer will be made through the equilibrium price auction mechanism and will be made before the beginning of the negotiation of the ordinary round of shares of the colombian stock exchange which is scheduled for october  this in accordance with the provisions of the organizations share disposal regulations according to the results that ecopetrol announced from the first sale of its shareholding in eeb   million shares of   each were offered of which  million were sued with valid acceptances for a joint amount of   million at that time the president of eeb stated that the participation of the solidarity sector demonstrates the confidence of investors in the company supported by the solidity of its finances and its growth projectsecopetrol inaugurated a well that will supply water to the tumaco community together with the mayor of the municipality and the navy the work was inaugurated that is part of the plan launched by the oil company after the attacks against the transandino pipeline that left tumaco without water for  days in the testing process the company lasted  days and with more than  manhours of work without interruptions it was possible to finish the drilling of the deep water well on the land of the municipalitys drinking water treatment plant which will serve as alternative source of supply for future emergenciesecopetrol will generate at least us   million more with peace additionally the costs of the repairs that the company has had to enter have been   million which according to the company could have generated  megaschools or  social housing under this panorama and observing fields that are not currently profitable juan carlos echeverry explained that peace would be a great contribution to the oil of the future because it will allow the development of areas that today have security problems that is the exploration and exploitation of departments such as vichada or areas such as the caguanputumayo basin that currently only represent  of national production could increase and this is essential because more than what is known where there would be recoverable oil resources of  million barrels and gas of  giga cubic feet experts point out that more exploration would surprise in fact according to humberto calderon verti president of the oil company with the most exposure in the area vetra the prospective area with the most immediate future is that and that is where we have to look at how to encourage exploration in the same way the minister of mines and energy tomas gonzalez explained it explaining that in addition to the increase in production from the caguanputumayo basin the nations income would increase the attacks on the oil infrastructure greatly affected production in recent months for july the losses were around  barrels a negative impact that we estimate at   million less taxes   million less in dividends that ecopetrol contributes and   million less in royalties that are not going to be received and that are vital for the financing of social programs this shows once again the costs of the conflict and the importance of the peace process  now facing the period while the agreements are signed we must be careful since according to eduardo borda medina executive director of trust it cannot be ruled out that new attacks are carried out in the course of a dynamic of indiscipline search for internal positions or even frank divisions in the insurgency phenomena typical of transitions such as the one registered in the country today  finally according to the most recent study by cerac in addition to the removal of obstacles that impede economic and social development the generation of livestock profits and the valuation of financial assets will be created with peace the victims of the attacks on the other hand the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry explained that the real victims are the most vulnerable people and ecosystems therefore so far in  without counting the volume of the last attack on the ota more than  barrels of crude oil have been spilled due to  attacks on the countrys oil infrastructure that affected rivers wetlands and fertile lands according to the minister of environment and sustainable development gabriel vallejo the environmental wounds left by this disaster will take more than a decade to repair the opinion juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol peace would be a great contribution to the oil of the future because it would allow the development of areas that today have security problemsecopetrols share hit new historical lows today reaching a price of   according to analysts ecopetrol has been affected by the volatility in oil prices as they assure that it has also been a generalized behavior in the stock market ecopetrol was in  at a price of   i believe that in the short term it will regain that value said jose david lopez valoraltas director of economic research at  in the morning the title of the oil company fell  at a price of  ecopetrol and the national university analyze destabilization in wells in the words of the project leader abel naranjo professor of the department of processes and energy of the faculty of mines when a well is drilled the rocks are altered in their stress state and this alteration can damage the oil fields  and he adds what we are looking for is to study the response that the formations that cross the well may have and see if this response may represent any risk for drilling the project aims to carry out geomechanical studies in some oil wells located in casanare and the caribbean sea to minimize possible complications when drilling and thus avoid the economic consequences of destabilizing a well as well as the loss of information  we may be talking about several dozen million dollars lost by not taking into account the response of the reservoir during drilling naranjo points out the study began in july this year and is scheduled to be completed in six months additionally the national university will hold a technology transfer course with ecopetrol personnel to instruct the company on geomechanical training and share the knowledge acquired on the destabilization of the wells a matter that according to the project leader it is a specialized issue that has become very important at the university we have been working on this issue for  years so there is an important knowledge and experience curve  from professor naranjos perspective it is very important for the university to work on projects that are directly applicable that provide solutions to practical problems and the industry often does not have the time to investigate these problems the expert concludes the university wins academically because its professors and students acquire more knowledge about these issues and the company wins because it can solve real problems that is the motivation to work on joint projects  opinions abel naranjo professor of the department of processes and energy of the faculty of mines national university the university and the industry have a relationship that has become very strong lately the academy makes its academic and scientific contribution and the company its economic and technical contribution changes in ecopetrol continue with the reorganization of shares in pipelines the idea of the company is to consolidate the transportation segment in cenit the process as reported by the company will be done in parts first a subsidiary company with  of the shares called sento will be consolidated which will later be absorbed by cenit these movements are in addition to the projects in which the company expanded ocensa transportation the expansion of san fernando  monterrey and costa norte  galan in addition to the completion of the covenas maritime terminal which increased storage capacity by  million barrels the optimization of these processes in addition to greater economic benefits for cenit and ecopetrol allow exports to be increased especially those directed to singapore and europe additionally yesterday began the first phase of the offer of the participation in interconectado electrica isa which will end on november  and with which it is expected to raise   million which will be added to the   billion that it expects to collect from the sale of the shares of empresa de energia de bogota eeb of which  has already been sold now in terms of sales the asian market has gained importance for ecopetrol and this is demonstrated by the participation in sales to that region while in  exports to asia only represented  today they are close to  and new markets continue to be explored  in terms of exploration the new strategy does not have a fixed percentage of success rate however the purpose of the strategy is to keep the reserve replacement rate above  and by  the goal is to reach accumulated contingent resources of  million barrels of oil equivalent which are those that will guarantee the growth of future production in terms of production where value is prioritized over volume ecopetrol will focus its activity on the fields that generate value as effectively set out in the strategy in this sense in the face of small fields the company is making an evaluation of those that do not comply with this premise which would be offered to potential interested parties in the first or second quarter of  prior approval of the conditions by part of the board of directors  explained the officials now in front of the improved recovery plans with which it is expected to increase production  pilots are being carried out in the main fields  of these with pressure increases and  with crude production increases also in an agreement with stanford university research and development of improved recovery for heavy crude oil and the application of  technology infill drilling water injection and asp is being carried out cost reduction reaches   trillion in terms of costs where the company has already achieved its  goal of   trillion and increased it to   trillion the greatest effort comes at a time when the price international crude oil had a new relapse to less than us   per barrel the greatest efforts have been in drilling well drilling time has been reduced for example in castilla it was reduced from  to  days and that is lower costs more modern drills are also being brought in with greater efficiency opinions hector manosalva vice president of ecopetrol production the strategy to optimize costs is beginning to pay off lifting costs have decreased and that allows maintaining production levels juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol the exploration strategy begins to give positive results like kronos and orca which opened the new exploratory frontier in the caribbean sea and its development will take place in ecopetrol signed an agreement with parex for the development of the aguas blancas field investments for the first phase which would take three years will be for us   million and would be assumed by parex at this stage the money will be used for drilling wells and for the development of a secondary recovery pilot if successful total investments could amount to us   million and  will be in charge of parex and  by ecopetrol the agreement would allow the recovery of  million barrels of light crude oil and increase the production of that field to  barrels per day in  aguas blancas was discovered in  and registers to date an accumulated production of about one million barrels of light crude  degrees apiecopetrol will deliver information per icp case in november likewise it pointed out that in the case of the contracts with alg ingenieros limitada ecopetrol identified the deviations and filed the complaints and lawsuits of the case in  and  before judicial authorities prosecutors office and administrative contentious court and control entities in addition it reported that a lawsuit filed before the administrative court of bolivar is being processed before the council of state requesting the timely settlement of the contract and the recognition of the costs assumed for equipment leasing   million and for transportation equipment   million regarding the varichem case ecopetrol filed the complaints and recovered all the monies from activities not executed by the contractor due to deviations in  finally it indicated that the location studies of a butterfly farm in neomundo were already endorsed by the environmental authority  after the executors of the convention center acquired the commitment to move the butterfly park after affecting its completionecopetrol seeks to increase participation in exploration areas in brazil the oil market timing is not favorable but the auction for exploration rights for oil and gas areas to be held later wednesday in brazil has interesting assets clark told reporters brazil will hold its first oil exploration rights auction in two years a kind of referendum on the willingness of investors to bet on a country whose industry and economy are under severe pressureecopetrol needs another try with empresa de energia de bogota as explained the second stage of the disposal and award program which was offering  million shares at a price of   per unit was declared void which leaves the oil company with three additional attempts to close the sale  it is good to remember that in the first stage which by law obliges companies to offer shares to the solidarity sector ecopetrol managed to sell  million shares that is about  of the shares it placed in a principle for sale for an amount of   million the president of eeb ricardo roa barragan assured that the results are understandable given the volatility that the markets are experiencing which makes investors have a prudent attitude before making any new investment decision with this ecopetrol is trying to obtain cash to be more efficient in what it knows how to do which is to produce and find oil as explained by its president juan carlos echeverry who is also seeking a direct negotiation with epm for the sale of invercolsa ecopetrol and preferential bancolombia the most moved shares on the bvc in its most recent report the financial superintendency of colombia sfc indicated that between june  and september  ecopetrols species presented an average volume of transactions of   and a frequency of  moved per month this is followed by the preferred title of bancolombia with an average of   and  transactions per month in the third position is the avianca holdings preferential which presented an average of   and  operations per month grupo aval ranked fourth with   on average and a frequency per month of  operations the top five is closed by grupo argos which had   and  operations it is important to highlight that for the average of operations in money the total value of the operations carried out for each share was taken into account divided by the number of operations carried out during the period considered diego franco stockbroker explained that these averages they are due to the relationship that assets have between operators of the same group where operations are carried out among themselves and that increases in the second period  he also highlighted that stocks in the financial and construction sectors are the ones that have performed the best during the year due to their strength and number of flows which makes them stable despite the slowdown jose david lopez valoralta analyst pointed out that this average volume in the case of bancolombia is due to the fact that its value was close to that of issuance which is why it generated a greater appetite on the part of investors in the case of cement companies he pointed out that these figures are related to the financial results presented by the species which is why they are among the most recommended to invest in the stock market sale of eeb shares on the other hand last friday october   the auction by xstream for the sale of the shares of empresa de energia de bogota saesp eeb owned by ecopetrol sa was declared void after this failed

appreciation was isagen which rose  to   this species was followed by construcciones el condor which rose  to   and isa which ended with an increase of  to   on the other hand the species that fell the most were pacific which fell  to   bancolombbia which fell  to   and avianca fell  to   opinions jose david lopez valoralta analyst these marketability averages are associated with the good financial results of the companies and the attractive prices they have presented in recent weeks diego franco analyst and stock market expert this behavior in the shares is associated with the crossovers between operators and the stability of the financial and construction sectors so far this yearecopetrols share falls  and is trading below   on the colombian stock exchange at this time on the colombian stock exchange bvc ecopetrols species is one of those that devalues the most and falls  to   for its part the preferred share of avianca holdings is the one that falls the most with  to   this drop is due to the fact that the company will pay shares in the next few days and it entered an exdividend period finally the colcap the main index of the bvc fell  and stood at  unitspdvsa petrobras and ecopetrol in the eye of the hurricane due to internal corruption scandals it is the same medium it is the same journalists it is the same approach it is the same string of lies said ramirez about what was published by the north american newspaper a scandal surrounds this and two other of the most important oil companies in brazil and colombia in the case of pdvsa it was learned that the dea and the fbi are seeking to establish whether ramirez and salazar used the company as a means to obtain bribes of up to us   million for those who wish to enter into a business with the venezuelan and it is that apparently the company would be in something more than a matter of bribes according to the same american newspaper pdvsa would have laundered through the private bank of andorra about us   billion from the black market of foreign currency and even drug trafficking for the political scientist and international relations expert ruben sanchez what is happening in venezuela seems to be a time bomb when corruption and impunity come together they affect the institutions something similar happened with petrobras a brazilian state company that produced  million barrels a day in  the company seems to see things more complicated in a scandal that affected ministers and political associates of president dilma rousseff and former president luis inacio lula da silva the federal police of that country found a deficit of us   billion in the coffers of the institution in addition to a series of events involving former members of the company in the bribery scheme after the scandal petrobras closed  with historic losses of us   billion if brazils gdp falls two points as has been said it will not only be due to the corruption and bribery scandals by petrobras it must be taken into account that behind there is an entire economic phenomenon that drives poor results said giovanni reyes an expert in international relations at the universidad del rosario the brazilian congress blamed dishonest employees and suppliers for the acts and the comptroller general of that country valdir simao assured that his entity is drawing up a map to have greater vigilance over the countrys companies finally ecopetrol since  has experienced a similar situation that year some officials of the petrotiger company bribed ecopetrol employees to avoid penalties for breaches of contracts between the two entities as has been known the petrotiger company may have lost up to us   million due to the scandal with ecopetrol the firm reportedly had to cut its budget by   and lay off at least  employees for catherine pereira director of the international business program at the university of la sabana the issue is more due to economic consequences that are not so serious and not because investor confidence is going to sink in such a way that companies enter a period of financial crisis its more of a reputation issue pdvsa petrobras and ecopetrol failed to comply with something essential to be consistent with their business and state policies there obviously there is a loss of confidence which is very difficult to recover said pereira in the three related cases there have already been dismissals resignations and dismissals furthermore at least ten implicated are on the verge of going to jail pemexs past with hewlettpackard in april  as reported by the united states securities commission hewlettpackard mexico paid more than us   million in commissions to obtain a software business with the mexican state oil company at the time the us authorities revealed that the director of operations of pemex at that time raul livas elizondo as director of the consulting firm that ultimately signed the contract with hewlettpackard would have received us   for the final agreement through a entity under its control the us authorities assured that in  the hewlettpackard sales team began negotiations with pemex for amounts of us   million opinions ruben sanchez political scientist and international relations expert when corruption and impunity come together it is very difficult to do something in these cases economic problems can be healed the difficult thing is to restore confidence  giovanni reyes international relations expert at the universidad del rosario the brazilian or venezuelan economy will not be affected only by scandals here there are very difficult economic situations that complicate things more  catherine pereira director of international business universidad de la sabana the big problem with all this is that a whole series of disincentives are beginning to be generated that do not allow foreigners to focus on those involvedecopetrol will assume the operation of campo rubiales from june   ecopetrol informs that by decision of its board of directors once the participation contracts of riesgo rubiales and asociacion piriri are concluded on june   it will assume the operation from the rubiales

assume responsibility for this exploitation area located in puerto gaitan goal the president of the cinmipetrol council alejandro martinez highlighted that this field has an important production between  and  barrels it will increase its levels and reserves for ecopetrol which will be a challenge now with the low price he explained despite this ecopetrol assured that it will continue working with pacific on activities and initiatives with the aim of seeking operational infrastructure and social responsibility optimizations in the production areas of the eastern plains one of the factors that the company took into account was the fact that ecopetrol has experience in operating fields that produce heavy crude such is the case in castilla also in meta in addition sources from the oil company pointed out that from july of next year royalties for campo rubiales will go from  to  it should be remembered that pacifics commitment is that as the price of oil recovers production levels will be reviewed and it will be decided whether or not to resume exploration activity as the firm decided to give priority to projects that generate higher profitability given market conditions ronald pantin ceo of pacific ep told lr in an interview that although campo rubiales once represented nearly  of its net reserves for pacific it currently represents less than  we multiplied production by  going from  barrels per day in  to  barrels in august  when the production record was reached he recalled he also stated that the techniques implemented in the oil field made campo rubiales the jewel in the crown that it became in fact pantin indicated that the company has the assets the knowledge and the track record to replace most of the net production when the contract ends in  we have a diversified portfolio of assets with  blocks in seven countries which which represents a proven and probable  reserve base certified as of december   of  million barrels  the operation that pacific had been carrying out was based on the deep knowledge they have in fields in venezuela i trust that ecopetrol has the knowledge and maintains high levels of production martinez said finally the colombian oil company took advantage of the statement to congratulate its canadian counterpart for their work in the oil field and the years of working together opinion alejandro martinez chairman of

contracts which were held with perenco oil and gas colombia and gran tierra energy respectively the future renegotiation of about  contracts that expire between  and  are in check thus those who are calmer for the moment are the producers of the fields that are considered small which in this case are the majority with a production of less than  barrels per day but the tension remains on the main fields that expire between now and  and that today generate about  barrels per day and expect to increase production to double in the following years thus in addition to rubiales piriri tauramena santana chaparral and espinal which expire in  and which already belong to ecopetrol for the following years come recetor in  piedemonte in  nare in  and boqueron in  this not counting the quifa contract from pacific ep which has a longer life until  and which for the moment has no desire to begin its renegotiation for these cases ecopetrol has already started the independent analysis of the proposals and if there is greater value for the company in not extending that will be the decision the company explained with this outlook the oil company that has shown the greatest interest in continuing to operate and increase its production in the nare contract is mansarovar energy a multinational that belongs  to the chinese company sinopec and  to the indian state company ongc videsh the latter with six additional independent exploration fields in colombia that would begin to generate in the coming years for them it is essential to achieve the renegotiation of this contract quickly which today operates  for ecopetrol and  for mansarovar since it is necessary to start analyzing the investment plan for the coming years if the contract is renewed we would make substantial investments to follow the companys objective which is to double the production we have outside the country in the next three or four years  explained sudhir sharma exploration director at ongc videsh who added that colombia is an important focus since in addition to the fact that the operating environment has improved a lot the tax regime is friendly and has an immense potential for hydrocarbons especially offshore in the caribbean finally the manager of the company that owns mansarovar pointed out that the company is the jewel in the crown since it has a profitability of  which should be taken into account since in the country this figure is far below but it clarifies that until the extension is assured it will be difficult to make the investment technology and pilot project in chichimene despite the failed negotiations of other companies mansarovar has an advantage to achieve the negotiation and it is ecopetrols interest in its technology this since the indian company invests a large part of its capital in innovation and has the best recovery and production projects for heavy crude additionally the chichimene pilot project in which air injection is being used is based on air injection technology for the production of heavy crude from ongcs mehsana field if the expected results are achieved this could increase the recovery factor above  the same situation occurs with the jazmin and nare sur fields with the continuous steam injection project which can reach a recovery factor of  by  opinions sudhir sharma director of exploration at ongc videsh our goal is to double the companys production outside the country which today is  barrels so we plan substantial investments for nare  lv dapeng director of the culture department of sinopec group clearly the first factor in choosing a project is profitability but it is also necessary to look at how the government and communities cooperate in these casesgrupo argos ecopetrol pacific and drummond preserve flora and fauna the environmental authorities have set themselves the objective of preserving the areas where fauna and flora find their habitat in this work companies such as grupo argos ecopetrol pacific exploration  production and drummond have put a grain of sand to help the conservation of species giving them the right place to guarantee their preservation and in this way help reduce the crimes of its trafficking or destruction grupo argos led in  investments of about   million for initiatives in terms of culture social and ecological projects in this last aspect the antioquia firm gave   million to the medellin botanical garden for the remodeling of spaces research conservation and promotion of the native flora two of the companies that are part of the groups parent company situm and sator led more specific initiatives in this regard last year on the one hand situm invested   million in the construction of an ornamental and forest nursery likewise sator reforested  hectares in which native species were also found in the companys social responsibility report on what was done in  the company confirmed that one of its pillars was the sustainable environmental development of the country the company reported that it is highlighted that during  the organization joined the ceo water mandate of the united nations to deepen its commitment to water conservation and signed an agreement with unhabitat to promote the implementation of the new urban agenda world ecopetrol on the other hand reported a couple of months ago on the delivery of  hectares for the protection of water sources the project which was carried out in the municipality of paez in boyaca was also led by the regional autonomous corporation of the department the initiative sought to take care of a waterproducing area in which a large amount of  emissions are also captured the plan also manages to preserve some of the most representative spices of the place for the specialist in environmental law at the universidad del rosario gloria amparo rodriguez although what these companies manage to do in terms of protection of fauna and flora is redeemable many times it does not seem to be enough or necessary what is needed here is a relationship of transparency between what companies benefit from the exploitation of land and the way they are compensating for it many times it is not proportional  another of the oil companies that has been concerned about this aspect in the country is pacific exploration  production the firm delivered  hectares this year in the vicinity of puerto gaitan the company has been leading the campo rubiales vivero program for some time which seeks to preserve the land intervened on account of oil exploration vivero de campo rubiales produced  species in  enough to reforest about  hectares this project in addition to helping the environment has managed to generate about  permanent jobs on this point cecilia lopez former minister of the environment pointed out that although companies are leading important projects to mitigate a bit the blow of the operations they lead it is necessary for the state to establish stronger public policies on what companies should do  here it is not a matter of companies replacing the duty of the national government to safeguard flora and fauna it is a matter of establishing clear measures for companies to comply with and carry out their projects finally the american drummond has been leading several environmental plans in colombia the company that is an expert in the exploitation and processing of coal received harsh sanctions from the national government in  after learning about the illegal dumping of coal the operations led to the suspension of operations in santa marta currently drummond has reported the conservation of animal species on the land where it operates the company recently reported that it has safeguarded  animals including snakes red monkeys whitefaced monkeys and tigrillos the company has confirmed that it has a team of specialized environmentalists who capture and relocate the animals found in the exploration areas led by the company in the most favorable habitat this initiative is contemplated in a social project where drummond has invested   million for populations in its area of influence nutresa makes its contribution in medellin in  the leading food company in colombia nutresa donated a property from colcafe within the pact for the forests of antioquia for conservation in the municipality of jardin the initiative sought at the time to promote the conservation of the flora of the place in addition to promoting research and education on the care of the species that inhabit this part of antioquia several species of magnolias one of the most primitive groups of flowering plants in the world have been found on this site of which the majority are threatened with extinction opinions cecilia lopez former environment minister it is not about companies replacing what the national government should do parameters have to be set so that companies are responsible  gloria amparo rodriguez director of environmental law u rosario what private companies do is rescued but likewise they must be clear about the damage they do and the reparation they must leadin the coming months ecopetrol will evaluate its ecogsai technology currently the field is working on the design of an air injection pilot that could increase crude oil barrels substantially in this case and unlike other air injection projects that have been implemented in the industry in the last  years ecopetrols technology registered with the superintendency of industry and commerce sic as ecogsai has several peculiarities among the most outstanding is the design of special wells the way in which the combustion front will propagate in the reservoir taking advantage of the gravitational force and the geometric configurations of the wells and their design to favor the process the company explained this pilot began to develop in its experimental stage since  and entered the construction stage in  to date the technological test has not yet begun so the company has not explained what the total investment in the development of the technology will be  but he commented that he is finetuning details to start the pilot who will show the evaluation in the coming months regarding the implementation in the field the company depends on the results of the pilot both technical and economic evaluation finally as part of this pilot the air injection laboratory was built in the icp one of the few in the world with which it is intended to study all the variables before applying it in the fieldecopetrol completed a plant that will reduce its transportation costs the plant which will have a capacity to process  barrels of oil per day was built in a year and a half in addition the technology it applies is called ecodesf which was developed by the colombian petroleum institute icp finally the company explained that the deasphalting plant will enable the extraction of heavy and extraheavy crude reserves and will reduce diluent consumption from  to we feel that ecopetrol is being driven to wither says uso how is this event that you have in bogota the uso  years ago within the framework of a negotiation process between ecopetrol and the uso established the first national assembly for peace today in a process of negotiation with the company we will hold the second national assembly for peace we are convening the uso the national university for the government the ministry of labor and the union sindical obrera ecopetrol is the economic sponsor of the event it is an event of the workers for colombia and the conclusions that come out of here plus those of the regional events that we did go to havana cuba we believe that it is a very important space for peacebuilding for the workers but also for the colombian people one imagines that minister luis eduardo garzon who was also an active member of the unionism at the time is going to be very important in that dialogue that will take place in those days in the assembly how has been the treatment that you have felt from the ministry the contribution of the national government the high commissioner for peace president juan manuel santos and especially minister luis eduardo garzon has been very positive who has been an ally of this call for it to be carried out at the national level and to give it the finalization  but we believe that this national assembly for peace should not die here on november  on the contrary we believe that it is a scenario where basically the proposals of the colombian people are given where three very critical issues are taken and that have been peacebuilding in these regional events and we believe that the participation of the ministry of education has been very positive i work in this call we are facing a difficult oil situation how do you see that the international price of oil has hit them directly into the pockets of oil workers yes of course indeed all this world situation that is felt today in the arab countries in the organization of petroleum exporting countries undoubtedly hits a country that depends on oil the finances of this country in part and the sector that contributes almost  points to gdp we have felt the blow workers above all due to the loss of almost  jobs nationwide in addition we also feel that the first colombian company such as ecopetrol is leading to a withering for today or tomorrow to be privatized we believe that this will set a stage on the issue of peace we are going to place the real situation of ecopetrol of the high indebtedness of the high dividends that have been delivered in the last seven years of the dismemberment process that the company has suffered in several subsidiaries and subsidiaries of what today is handled in paradises prosecutors it is an issue where we have to sit down and tell the colombian people that today the first company that has sustained the national economy is under threat how do you see the appointment of juan carlos echeverry then between president echeverry and the uso since there have been very few meetings we have had we have put a nationalist and sovereign position in defense of the first company of colombians but is there little space then we have told you that we have construction proposals between the parties there are proposals where today the company has a cash problem due to the high indebtedness it has in dollars the liabilities that exceed   billion which is almost  of the equity value of the company company there is an important issue these days and it is the governments negotiation to reach an agreement on the minimum issue but last year we have the experience that it was not achieved so easily and additionally this year we have the problem of inflation how do you see the figure what would you propose for those tables that are going to be held and what would be your point of view regarding the increase in the  minimum wage well the national governments projection at that time was at  and i think this is going to almost double to  and the governments income from the oil sector will fall significantly which is going to be around   billion this year year but next year is going to be much more difficult i believe that here we must rearrange the economy we must invite all colombians to consume their own products that are made here to give it dynamism even give incentives to the industry in the oil sector i believe that even we it is time to look at the whole issue of the tax exemptions that have been given to them the gabelas that have been given to the oil companies but that have not translated into benefits for the colombian stateecopetrol recorded profits of   million in the third quarter of the year the industry continued in a complex environment given the lower oil prices and the consequent adjustments in investments costs and expenses observed in the oil and gas companies ecopetrol has also responded to the challenges imposed by the attacks on the oil infrastructure the el nino phenomenon the closure of the border with venezuela and the devaluation of the exchange rate commented juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol he added that the company has been reinventing itself to face this new reality through the transformation program contained in the  strategy and that the implementation of the transformation program manages to increase efficiency in a structural way and strengthens an organizational culture based on in the principles of integrity collaboration and creativity the production of the business group in the first nine months of the year reached  kbped thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day increased by  kbped compared to the same period in ecopetrol registers a net profit of   billion until september the industry continued in a complex environment given the lower oil prices and the consequent adjustments in investments costs and expenses observed in the oil and gas companies ecopetrol additionally has responded to the challenges imposed by the attacks on the oil infrastructure the el nino phenomenon the closure of the border with venezuela and the devaluation  commented juan carlos echeverry president of the company regarding ebitda the firm registered   billion in addition the companys production in the first nine months of the year reached  kbped thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day a figure that shows that it increased by nine kbped compared to the third quarter of  the company has it has been reinventing itself to face this new reality through the transformation program contained in the  strategy the implementation of the transformation program manages to increase efficiency in a structural way and strengthens an organizational culture based on the principles of integrity collaboration and creativity  added echeverry ecopetrol achieved budgetary savings in the order of   trillion in september exceeding the initial goal of   trillion defined for  amounts that reflect both structural savings and savings from the rationalization of some activities carried out by the firm this positive result is due according to information provided by the firm to the reduction in production costs  barrel that have been made in addition the company has set itself a new challenge to achieve   trillion in budget savings in  seeking to cushion part of the effect of a lower international price of crude oil through efficiencies and lower costs of services purchases oil services and maintenance among the companys achievements during this third quarter the generation of value for shareholders through the rotation of the asset portfolio stands out culminating the first stage of the sale of its shareholding in the empresa de energia de bogota of which obtained resources for   million also the opening of the first round of the sale process of interconectado electrica sa regarding refining echeverry highlighted that on october  the new cartagena refinery fulfilled a key milestone in its ignition and startup process with the introduction of hydrocarbons to the crude unit the first shipment of refined products will take place in november this is the first step for the sequential entry of the  plants that make up the new cartagena refinery capable of producing clean fuels that meet the highest environmental standards in international markets  emphasized the president of the oil company on the other hand in transportation the storage of crude oil in covenas was consolidated with two tanks of  barrels capacity each which came into operation in the fourth quarter of  and in september in order to verify the performance of transportation systems with higher viscosity crude oil a test was carried out on the pipelines that transport heavy crude for export according to the company the test result was successful which will allow reducing diluent consumption in  among the negative figures is the  drop in production compared to the second quarter of  and the price of the basket of crude oil which fell  however their results are positive compared to other firms that are part of this sector that according to orlando santiago jacome an analyst at fenix valor are showing losses due to the current economic situation of attacks on infrastructure and devaluation both those that are engaged in exploration as well as production and marketing business opportunities in magdalena medio in the magdalena medio area ecopetrol also has business opportunities specifically with occidental andina llc oxy for the development of a pilot project if successful according to company information up to  million barrels of crude could be added to the companys reserves in the la cirainfantas field and in addition to that and with the canadian company parex resources in the aguas blancas field another pilot will be carried out that aims to recover  million barrels of light crude therefore ecopetrol expects better results in the future the opinions juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol ecopetrol has responded to the challenges imposed by the attacks on the oil infrastructure the el nino phenomenon and the devaluationecopetrol will receive more than   billion for breach of contract the plaintiff estimated that ecopetrol was not delivered what corresponded to it in accordance with the established contract that is  of the crude production obtained in the stage of extensive production tests carried out in the exploration period in said area the chamber explained that the private company at the time of signing the contract knew the clauses and the obligations and rights derived from it so in application of the principle of good faith it had to report its nonconformities request clarifications make the reservations of the case and propose new formulas or the redesign of the contract or the offer to balance the situation that they considered was irregular however the company was silent and only when ecopetrol demanded compliance with the obligation did it express its disagreement and refrained from delivering the corresponding percentage said attitude the ruling indicates is contrary to contractual good faith which is objective in nature and requires that the conduct of each of the parties in each contractual stage precontractual contractual and postcontractual consults and addresses itself to satisfy the interest expected by his counterpart from the beginning of the business relationship  additionally the private entity unilaterally interpreted the clauses of the contract and determined that the distribution and reimbursement of the corresponding percentage to ecopetrol should be done as agreed for the exploitation and not for the stage of extensive production tests as it was more favorable to its interests the chamber points out that the execution of a certain contract or legal business of a state nature is totally unacceptable for the contractor in his capacity as collaborator to unilaterally interpret the clauses initially agreed upon to the detriment of the interests of the administration since in that hypothesis he would be breaching in essence what was agreed and with this would be violating the principle of objective good faith that should govern every contract or legal business of a state nature  for this reason the entity is condemned to pay ecopetrol the amount corresponding to the barrels of oil that have not been compensated and which at prices of the time correspond to more than   millionecopetrol america won the award of four blocks to explore in texas according to the company of the four blocks three were won in a consortium with anadarko and another the company owns  of the rights and investments the results were made official by the bureau of ocean energy management boem a united states government entity and the companies offers had been presented last august in the round that was held in new

blocks   and  in consortium with anadarko the combined economic offer is us   millionannual investment goal in ecopetrol is us   million on average juan carlos echeverry president of the oil company explained that it is necessary to reinvent itself to compete in the world with other oil companies when you sell a product that a year ago was worth us   a barrel and today is worth us   this represents a huge challenge and you have to adapt to these new circumstances for this reason the company has already begun to cut production costs without affecting profits the idea is to bet on exploration and continue working on improved production and recovery if fields decline in  we must improve exploration we want to be a panamerican company based in colombia  reduction in investment between  and  investment fell  that is it was adjusted to us   million it is necessary to invest in profitable projects and protect the cash you have to save money and be very careful said echeverry reduction in costs and expenses regarding the cost of the lifting it was reduced per barrel to us   when it was previously at us   in part this is due to the devaluation but also to the cost cutting that has been made said the director of the state oil company the cost of transportation went from us   per barrel to us   we are looking for a way to make barrels profitable said the president and the price of refining went from us   to us   per barrel we are doing what needs to be done in terms of lowering costs we are one of the four oil companies that are making a profit echeverry assured international context oil prices have fallen due to the production of russia saudi arabia and the fact that china is growing very fast we have a global phenomenon that has pulled our share price down and it will take three or four months for the market to recover echeverry said finally despite the lean cows that ecopetrol is going through the president was optimistic about the future although he did not predict how much the action would be in the medium and long termecopetrols share hit historical lows of   yesterday on the bvc orlando santiago manager and analyst at fenix valor pointed out that this is due to the fact that opec will meet on december  to talk precisely about oil prices so that a cut in production could have a positive impact on prices however the international market expects them to maintain their production levels which are  of world oil which is why the prices of the other producers of the raw material in the world do not increase  for its part the most important drop of the day was registered by pacific exploration  production with a negative variation of  to   in turn the title of bancolombia was located with  to a close of   and the top three was

ecopetrol announced that the first stage of sale of the shares of interconectado electrica saesp owned by ecopetrol sa aimed at the recipients of special conditions and in which   ordinary shares were

colombian stock exchange the stock with the highest appreciation on the trading day is pacific with a rise of  to   for its part colcap the bvcs main index registers a devaluation of  to  units the same behavior presents the colir that presents a fall of  to  units while the colsc rises  to  pointsthe three reasons why ecopetrol is at historical lows on the bvc diego franco stockbroker indicated that the price of oil is one of the main drivers of the behavior of ecopetrols share on the other hand despite the fact that the state company has generated positive results the market has tired of the oil company in other words investors are seeing the opportunity in other papers that are not exposed to the external market so they have preferred to rotate to go and look for these types of options  in addition the expert said that opecs announcement to maintain production at  barrels per day of crude with the reentry of indonesia will cause the price of fuels to seek lower levels the message is that opec by itself will not be the one that makes the price of crude rise and the message for the united states is that the price war continues and that the organization is going to drop it until it is necessary franco pointed out he stressed that the share will be exposed to a greater drop in its price but indicated that those who sell ecopetrol are very few people because the volumes traded are very low david villan an equity analyst at adcap agreed that opecs announcement not to reduce its production did not give oil relief to react upward which hurts the colombian oil company because the production costs of light and heavy crude are close to us   per barrel due to the price of diluents and other variables if one imagines a barrel of ecopetrol at us   the price of wti at us   and brent at us   we are at an equilibrium level where the pressure of nonoperating expenses must be discounted it is evident that ecopetrol exports most of its production there should be an exchange rate relief but this does not compensate for what the oil price implies at that level said villan the expert explained that the market sees that there is little expectation of growth but a decrease in production because it is necessary to maintain investments that has pushed the stock down to historic levels however for next year the operation of the cartagena refinery reficar and campo rubiales is expected to be positive in the middle of the year to increase production and reduce expenses for diluents and other necessary elements colcap lost  yesterday according to the colombian stock exchange bvc the colcap index lost  to  units and already registers a negative variation of  so far this year among the shares that presented the greatest devaluation is the preferential bbva colombia with a fall of  to   on the other hand banco de occidente was the action that stood out in yesterdays session by rising  to   finally the most traded share was ecopetrol with   millionecopetrols share continues to fall and at this time it is trading at   for its part isa is the species that presents the greatest devaluation with  to   followed by canacol which depreciates  to   on the other hand only three shares show appreciations on the day preferential grupo argos rises  to   in second place is corficolombiana additional dividend with a positive variation of  to   and finally the colcap at this time is in negative territory with a devaluation of  to  unitsdespite the drop in ecopetrols share price this is not the time to sell for agustin vera director of quantitative strategies global securities shortterm speculators should bear in mind that small oil producers in the united states are in trouble second the target positions in new york fell by about  million barrels which indicates that large traders have a bearish expectation for the price of crude in addition he added that the impacts of the drop in crude prices during  will take their toll on the annual results of companies in this sector for this reason the first quarter should not be so favorable for next year we expect a moderation in world production of about  million barrels which would lead crude oil to stabilize in the area of us   and us   per barrel on average under this scenario we consider that this sector  specifically ecopetrol and canacol  could only improve as of the third quarter of  after the semiannual meeting of opec where we expect an increase in the production goal from  million to  million barrels per day vera stressed taking into account the above if the investment is shortterm and it is among your plans to sell it is better to do it as soon as possible because greater falls in the price of crude oil are expected which would affect the price of the shares of the oil companies world level in addition it is estimated that the value of the dividend could be between   and   in  but if on the contrary the investment is longterm with an investment perspective of  to  years the price of the company is very cheap this is considering that the company is executing a cost reduction plan that has worked since the international drop in the price of oil has not been directly reflected in the balance sheets experts hope that in the long term cost savings will be seen and that the company will benefit from campo rubiales own production and the stabilization of barrel prices between us   and us   jose david lopez an analyst at valoralta agreed that it is time to maintain the positions because due to the dividend payment they have already recovered their investment in ecopetrol in addition he noted that the results will be positive if you want to buy shares at this time for six months it is not the best option but if you think about it for a few more years it is a great opportunity red monday for the oil sector in colombia on monday international oil prices registered downward pressure which took the reference barrel wti and brent to sixyear lows ecopetrol shares fell  to   two other oil companies also posted sharp falls pacific exploration and production corporation lost  to   and canacol energy ended at   losing  the opinion agustin vera director of quantitative strategies gsc to make the decision to exit ecopetrol it must be taken into account whether the investment is long or short termthe shares of ecopetrol and canacol would be replenished in the second semester of  diego franco stockbroker pointed out that for  oil will improve in the second semester for which a good performance of canacol and ecopetrol is expected with regard to the state company franco explained that a positive horizon is expected because its action has been punished despite the positive financial statements ecopetrol so far this year has already fallen close to  this if one takes into account that at the beginning of the year the share was trading at   and on the last day of the week it had a minimum closing price of   in this context the entry into operation of the cartagena refinery and the recovery of the rubiales field are aspects that will weigh in the valuation of ecopetrols share next year despite this david villan equity analyst at the adcap colombia commission agent indicated that in the state company the issue of expenses which have been cut is a factor that influences behavior because it has not allowed earnings are what was expected despite generating positive earnings the lower investments have made the scenario of new discoveries almost nil so no growth in production is expected  in the case of canacol franco said that the prospects are good because the company could consolidate itself as a gas producer in addition to that canacol is one of the few shares on the colombian stock exchange bvc that presents a positive variation so far this year with  this species at the beginning of  was located at a value of   and last wednesday at   villan stressed that the company has made positive decisions such as the migration from oil production to gas which has been agreed because while crude prices fall gas prices have not been affected in addition the company made announcements to double gas production with contracts that it will start selling at the beginning of  which will imply better revenues and expectations they have covered oil prices so that to a certain extent the fall in prices does not affect them the analyst pointed out for its part pacific already accumulates a negative variation of around  since its price at the beginning of the year was   and on december  it was   and franco indicated that  looks more complex due to structural financial and maturity of bonds  finally villan explained that the drop in pacifics share price was due to the drop in the sale of the company and the loss of the rubiales field which represented  of production pacific stock continues to free fall on the bvc during yesterdays session on the colombian stock exchange bvc the pacific stock continued in a dramatic decline it was once again the most undervalued stock in the market with a drop of  to   for its part bancolombia stood out on the day for being the most valued species of

the most traded with   million this was followed by a preferential bancolombia with   million opinions david villan adcap variable income analyst the behavior of the price has influenced the value of the oil shares listed on the bvc but corporate factors have been decisive diego franco stockbroker and economics expert  will be a challenging year for the three companies but the outlook for pacific offers more obstacles to overcome the future of the canadian will depend on that ecopetrol reduced its investment plan  to us   billion for  with these investments the business group expects to maintain a daily production of  barrels of oil equivalent additionally the investment budget is aligned with the new corporate strategy and responds to the challenging situation of the international oil market therefore the budgeted investments for  are  lower than those planned for  of the total investment approved for the ecopetrol group for us   billion us   billion will be invested in ecopetrol projects directly and us   billion in projects of affiliate and subsidiary companies in addition  of the investments will be made in colombia and  abroadoil at us   caused ecopetrols investment plan to decrease  according to diego franco an analyst at the stock market this investment figure for  us   billion does not surprise many since companies are rewarding the efforts made to remain in that survival mode even more so knowing that oil can reach us   us   per barrel in the first quarter of the following year according to ecopetrol it was time to redo the plan that had been presented in may of this year according to the  strategy and where investments of us   billion were expected since this strategy had planned a barrel at us   that apparently will not arrive next year  the largest investment continues to be in production with us   million  less than in  investments in transportation will decrease by  and are destined to the expansion of installed capacity the amount that increased was exploration  us   million this cautious plan is very valuable since really what companies face in the short term is the rule of surviving trying to endure and not compromising flows until oil stabilizes at us   us   in the second quarter of  where perhaps the company will have already achieved cuts that make new investments profitable explained felipe campos head of research at alianza valores now it does not stop worrying that despite the fact that investments are focused on the generation of barrels  of the total production in  will fall  in ecopetrol sa when before it was expected to increase between  and  annually to reach  barrels in  and this was the main figure that generated a  drop in the stock yesterday closing at   however the market rescued ecopetrol from being conservative since in recent years it has preferred to surprise than disappoint franco explained adding that the stock is expected to stabilize in the next two weeks similarly there is concern about plans to increase reserves by  billion barrels of oil equivalent since to reach this goal investments of us   to us   million were expected and which in reality this year will be us   million especially focused on offshore development wells and with zero investments in unconventionals in this sense analysts likewise point out that this is a safe strategy since those who have invested more thinking that it is cheaper to explore now have been wrong campos said now according to francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association in addition to the fall in prices the environment public order and delays in procedures continue to make investments difficult in refining and transportation investments of us   million are expected with a  drop cost reduction and recovery factor the plan also includes savings of us   million that like production can increase as variables such as reduction of service costs renegotiation of rates restructuring of contracts and administrative expenses are adjusted  in addition companies are attentive to the governments tax reform and that it could ease the cash to make investments finally recovery programs remain on the table with improvements in reserves that could be seen in  opinions felipe campos director of research at alianza valores the companies know that the worst part of the crisis is coming in the first quarter of  so what they face in the short term is the rule of survival  diego franco stock broker the idea is to direct investment to a more efficient gas production and to evaluate small discoveries the best thing is that it is less ambitious but it can be fulfilled ecopetrols board of directors approves the purchase of shares for   million according to its president juan carlos echeverri the transaction will be effective within eight business days following the approval date it also argued that it is an operation unrelated to speculationecopetrol hits historic lows on the colombian stock exchange it should be noted that this species began to decline since last december  when it was quoted at   in addition on the  of the same month the oil company reached what until today was its minimum since the issue which was   on the other hand the bvc indices are in negative territory colcap lost  to  while the colsc falls  to  points finally the tecnoglass share which debuted today in the colombian stock market is the one that values the most at   rising ecopetrol completed  patents in the oil industry this year of the patents obtained the previous year eight were granted by the superintendency of industry and commerce of colombia and one by the national institute for the defense of competition and the protection of intellectual property of peru according to the company the patents were granted for the biodiesel stabilization process the development of modular equipment for crude oil production and treatment facilities technology to counteract fuel theft to a device for scaling up the improved recovery process in hydrocarbon production fields to the treatment of sodas spent in refining processes to three devices for various operating processes and to a safe lifting system for elements on poles  thus these nine patents are added to the  patent applications for new technologies in colombia and another five based abroad made by the oil company several developed with the support of the colombian petroleum instituteecopetrol stock broke the   floor at this time the stock of the oil company is the third that loses the most in the bvc after pacific and caracol with a fall of  and is trading at   despite this the oil companys papers are the second most traded of the day surpassed only by those of isagen since they have moved   billionecopetrol rejected blockades that occurred today at facilities in bogota now within the reasons of the uso it seeks to reject the arbitrary and unjustified measures that the ecopetrol administration is taking which affect in an integral way the socioeconomic reality of the regions which today due to the decisions of the national government led by the then minister of finance today president of the company juan carlos echeverri the resources of the royalties were taken from them in  and satisfied them with the false promise of the oil investment portfolio until   they explained additionally they made a strong criticism of the decrease in the wages of workers who earn about   million since according to their accounts they would end up receiving   which means that they are below the average of similar companies in the sector but they recalled that for the reduction of costs that the company seeks and that is necessary for the sustainability of the company the high costs of labor and contractual intermediation in the company should be reviewed this would be a more effective and efficient measure than curtailing rights and affecting the dignity of workers they explained in a statement for the moment the company only sent a communication stating that it will keep open the spaces for constructive dialogue with the uso in normal working conditions but that they reject the facts presented today in the main building of ecopetrol since this affects normal performance of the company that is already going through one of its most complicated momentsthis is how ecopetrol works with a barrel of crude at us   today with oil at us   per barrel and in just one year it lost  due to the excess supply in the markets the situation is very difficult and what the nation will receive will be below    billion that were delivered in  therefore the million dollar question is how the company that operated with oil at us   works today and which projects are no longer profitable for having prices below us   value at which the price could be fluctuating in the nearest future diego franco an analyst at the stock market commented regarding this value that the odds are in favor of prices below us   and even us   in the first half of  this taking into account the entry of iran which could occur this week and the continuing slowdown in the chinese economy this being the case what is clear is that with a barrel at us   or even if it continues to fall many projects are going to be in difficulty even more so in colombia where more than  of crude oil is heavy and requires higher income explained francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp it is for this reason that ecopetrol is currently analyzing the more than  fields it has in the country in order to see where it can lower costs and make them profitable as explained by the company each field has its peculiarities so the analysis is field by field to see what can be done to save costs in each one the purpose is to avoid closing them as much as possible since that has enormous consequences for the company and the regions  similarly he pointed out that the idea is to find different alternatives by field that is if there are n number of wells in field x  the idea is to see if some can be closed or others optimized without closing the entire field this being the case and after completing the study the company will decide which ones cannot be followed or how they will be optimized however alejandro martinez cofounder of amv consultores recalls that in colombia our operating cost is between us   and us   per barrel for light crude that is the least expensive so in the extra heavy and especially in the unconventional and offshore new projects may not be viable now you have to understand that this would be to sign new contracts there the companies would not do it but to drill wells that are already subject to commitments they will surely do so  under this panorama the difference of the company of us   per barrel can be noticed since even coffee or tea is charged the red is free but for the rest of the drinks there are some dispensers that work with coins with this they hope to continue to maximize savings and thus make projects that were not profitable before all in order to be able to say that we are prepared for prices of up to us   faced with the investment plan which was announced in december would be us   billion the idea is to maintain it but freeze it that is employees were asked to update purchases and hiring justifying almost every day to the last peso in this way the company is freeing up resources and as prices increase if they do more cash is also delivered and it is that according to ecopetrol employees this became the companys flagship word which is doing everything possible not to lay off personnel or reduce salaries in fact its president juan carlos echeverry explained that to ensure continuity of employment salary tables were adjusted for activities not typical of the industry such as cleaning services surveillance cafeteria etc for new contracts but he added that in the same way these salaries are located in a privileged position only surpassed by  of the countrys companies in general these types of activities are compensated with a minimum salary while ecopetrol recognizes an average of  more than that said an official other savings to exceed the us   million goal since the instruction is to protect the box the company is not doing any remodeling and it is controlling printing expenses with the implementation of a system that keeps track of sheets regarding travel expenses reductions of  figure as of september were achieved that is savings of   million likewise in electric power nine contracts were renegotiated and consumption was reduced generating savings of   million in tank car transportation one of the highest costs   million have been saved sep with the renegotiation of  contracts opinions alejandro martinez cofounder of amv consultores ecopetrol has a great advantage due to its amount of assets also enters reficar now despite the effort in costs this has a limit  francisco jose lloreda president of the acp companies are doing what they can to compensate but the reality is that the costs of operating in the country are still highmoodys downgraded ecopetrols rating to  and put it on review in its explanation the agency indicated that ecopetrol has suffered a lot from the drop in oil prices and given the oil outlook it is expected that the stateowned companys cash flow and its credit metrics will continue to be affected increasing its credit risk additionally moodys indicated that the weakness in the companys cash generation together with limited financing possibilities will limit ecopetrols possibilities to meet its investments to maintain reserves and productionecopetrol stock fell  after moodys downgrade yesterday in addition to crude that fell to us   per barrel a price that it had not seen since  the rating firm moodys investor services informed the market that it had lowered ecopetrols rating to  from  with that the stock lost  and was the one that had the strongest fall during the trading day according to the rating agency the reduction in the note is due to the fact that the downward pressures of the international oil price will continue to negatively affect the companys cash flow and credit generation metrics which increases its credit risk  in line with that moodys analysis indicated that the companys weak cash generation coupled with limited financing possibilities will weaken ecopetrols ability to meet its planned investments to maintain reserves and production in addition the rating agency indicated that this new ecopetrol rating is under review thus opening the door for further reductions to the companys rating given these doubts about its cash generation the state company highlighted in a statement that the company undertook a transformation plan that reduced costs by   trillion in  ecopetrol is tackling new efficiency and savings initiatives for  to which added that despite the effects that the drop in oil prices has generated on most oil companies moodys highlights in its report the efforts made by ecopetrol to improve operating efficiencies and adjust its investment plan with in order to protect liquidity it highlights that ecopetrol has no material debt maturing in the next two years  in addition to this in the statement issued after learning of moodys decision ecopetrol stated that the company ecopetrol confirms that it will continue efforts to reduce costs and protect cash generation amid the current international price situation of the oil alexander figueroa analyst at afin comisionista de bolsa pointed out that the downgrading of the state oil company is a clear reflection of the behavior of the price of oil that is directly correlated with the variables that influence the performance of the company it took a while for the rating to drop and its the same thing that happened to pacific  the analyst also pointed out that if the price of crude continues to fall lower ratings could be seen however he stressed that everything will be in the hands of the rating firm and the perspectives it finds since it is the one that ultimately has the methodology and knows the variables of the oil company for his part wilson tovar head of economic research at stocks and securities pointed out that due to the companys income levels related to the drop in the price of crude this was predictable the company has a transversal relationship with the behavior of crude oil and it was normal for this to happen he said finally the analyst warned that this downgrade in the ratings of oil companies is something that can become common due to different estimates of oil prices and because there are forecasters such as standard chartered who estimate that a barrel of crude can reach us   despite this tovar said confidence that the oil company will fulfill its obligations has not been lost pacific the one that gained the most during the day during the first session of the week of the colombian stock exchange bvc the pacific ep share was the best performer rising  and closing with a price of   the second in the list of increases was the preferential one of grupo aval although it only managed to climb  on the other hand the ecopetrol share which was the one that fell the most  and was followed by isagen with a drop of  the colcap index closed at  units which implied a decline of  opinions wilson tovar head of economic research the ecopetrol issue responds to a temporary and global problem but trust in the company is not lost tomorrow more falls are expected in the price  alexander figueroa analyst at afin the downgrading of the oil company is a clear reflection of the behavior of the price of oil which is correlated with the income of the companyecopetrol rejects the uso blockade at the cartagena refinery as explained by the company this stoppage and cessation of activities has affected the changeover of shifts internal mobility and the normal development of activities with the consequences that this generates in the operation of this industrial complex that has not yet begun its operation complete faced with the facts ecopetrol explained that the union leaders of the national board and the uso subdirective have obstructed the entry of the operators who had shifts from  am  pm and  pm yesterday  and  am today with this the scheduled workers did not attend their work sites at the time the oil company activated the contingency plan to guarantee the operation of the refinery finally ecopetrol and several economic associations in the country reiterate the call for dialogue and agreement to resolve differences and for de facto actions to cease they also pointed out that union leaders must take into consideration the difficult situation the industry is going through with a barrel of crude around us  to maintain the balance sheets ecopetrol will have to divest more according to analysts firstly and if the barrel continues at us   it will be necessary for the oil company to reduce its production since  of the crude it extracts is heavy and has a balance point between us     per barrel for this reason they point out that the decision to cut production is key for the company since it will have to consider the impact on transportation earnings estimated at  of  ebitda additionally they point out that if a barrel of brent continues below us   the drop in ebitda could be close to us   or us   million compared to the ebitda for the third quarter of  which was us   million for this reason the recommendation of the experts if ecopetrol wants to keep its balance sheets positive is a greater cut in the investment plan which went from us   million to us   million and an increase in the savings goal in operation as they explain investments in colombia with current prices are not attractive and ecopetrol needs to raise more than us   million in  in divestments new debt and refinanced debt to keep cash at that amount finally the researsh team explained that with this situation it is very likely that strong changes will come for shareholders since as their bonds have been falling  the adjustment could be a drop in the dividend or the deferral of payment to their majority shareholder  in this way that money could be used as cash to maintain current operations that generate production and to increase exploration since without reservations the future situation could be more complicated in this way the company will be able to maintain responsible balances in the first half of the year which will feel the movements of crude oil more strongly and it will be able to recover for the second half of  when a rebound of the barrel of oil is expected to around us   or us   depending on the average forecasts of market analystsis it worth investing   million in shares of the ecopetrol firm despite this experts consider that the shares of the state company are a good investment because thanks to low oil prices their value is even below that of the book titles   according to the report of the colombian stock exchange of january  and in an investment horizon of two years the expectation is that these papers are trading up to   which would give a nominal return of about  in  months so if you had   million you could buy at fridays closing price  shares of the oil company and after a couple of years if the titles reached just   you would have   million the manager and cofounder of valora inversiones camilo silva indicated that the days when the shares of the oil company were at   are over although he stressed that it is possible to think that the firm will reach   driven by the confidence generated by the plan reduction of the companys expenses and an eventual rebound in crude oil prices in addition silva stressed that if the news that the oil company will not pay dividends this year the market would see the investment in the shares of the oil company with even better eyes still silva was emphatic in pointing out that the shares of the oil company are an investment over a medium time horizon and that if your intention is to obtain high returns in a year or less it is best to consider other investment options for his part global securities analyst agustin vera is not so optimistic about the possibility that ecopetrol shares will reach   but he did indicate that the papers may reach   due to the austerity plan in which it is immersed the oil company will help improve the companys numbers in the medium term in addition to that vera explained that from  the valuation of the firms securities would be close to  this year  will be the lowest in which we expect an appreciation of  or  for the next years we see appreciations of   he indicated in addition to the confidence generated by the investment plan there are two elements that generate peace of mind in the company and which was mentioned by moodys in the statement in which it reported the downgrade of the companys rating the first of these is that ecopetrol is a state company which implies that the government could eventually cover it and that it does not have debts with maturities of less than two years which would not additionally affect the outlook for cash flow from the company finally it should be remembered that these recommendations are not made only by local experts since a little over a month ago on december  deutsche bank changed its recommendation on ecopetrol from withhold to buy because they consider that the current price of the shares discounts problems such as the lack of growth of the company or the cut of the dividend while other factors such as the entry into operation of reficar or the return of campo rubiales will be positive elements market does not lose confidence in the oil company last week the rating agency moodys lowered ecopetrols score from  to  due to the problems that the company is having with the fall in oil prices even with that the agency highlighted the efforts that the oil company is making to reduce costs and the fact that it does not have debt maturities with less than two years the head of economic research at alianza valores wilson tovar explained that the downgrade in the companys rating was foreseeable and that the market continued to maintain confidence in the company the opinion agustin vera analyst of global securities the measures that ecopetrol took to reduce costs could improve the results of the company in the next two or three yearspacific ep and ecopetrol the shares that fell the most on the bvc thus the one that fell the most on the day was the pacific exploration  production stock which fell  and closed at   the second on the list of firms with the greatest setbacks was ecopetrol whose papers lost  and around four in the afternoon they were trading at   the podium of the shares that fell the most was completed by mancemento with a drop of  and a final price of   it should be remembered that yesterday the price of oil both brent and wti fell to the floor of us   per barrel which is why the prices of the shares of oil companies fell on the side of the shares that gained the most on the day the first place went to the nondividend share of corficolombiana whose price shot up  to   despite this gain the transactions of these titles barely moved  shares throughout the day amounting to just   million and were the fifth least traded shares on the stock market yesterday the second stock that stood out the most in yesterdays session was that of banco de occidente which had a rise of  to   and a volume of   million this species moved  shares during the entire session the podium was completed by promigas which had a rise of  to   in  shares and a volume of   million the species with the highest trading volume was ecopetrol with   million this asset moved  million shares bancolombia preferential with   million and a negative change in its price from  to   also stood out in this regard the third most traded was the icolcap species with   million with a negative change in its price from  to   in addition it traded  shares for its part the colcap index fell  to  units so far this year the stock market indicator registers a negative variation of  according to the bvc the colsc liquidity index fell  to  units and the colir fell  on the day to  pointsecopetrol constitutes a company for offshore operations this constitution allows to take advantage of the tax tariff and other benefits provided in decree  of  modified by  of  through which the conditions and requirements for the declaration of the existence of permanent offshore free zones are established the company explained in a statement the operation was carried out through hocol petroleum limited a  subsidiary of ecopetrol after the approval given by the board of directors of the parent company the new subsidiary has an authorized capital of   billion and a subscribed capital of   million it should be remembered that the rating agency moodys investors service reduced ecopetrols rating from  to  and put its outlook under review which means that it maintains its investment gradeecopetrols board of directors approved to start the process of disposal of propilco as explained by the company the resources from the sale will be used to strengthen the exploration and production businesses which are the focus of the company said disposal process will be carried out as pertinent in accordance with the provisions of law  of  which implies that ecopetrol sa must process and obtain the corresponding approval from the national government they statedsp changes ecopetrols outlook from stable to negative with this both agencies left the rating of the oil company in a bad way and with some possibilities of losing the investment grade the only agency that has not yet lowered ecopetrols rating is fitch which maintains it at bbbthe agency standard  poors lowered the outlook on ecopetrols rating it should be remembered that recently the rating agency moodys had lowered ecopetrols rating to  from  due to the problems the company is having to generate cash due to the drop in international oil prices thus only fitch ratings has kept the rating of the oil company stable despite this bad news for ecopetrol it was not all disappointment for colombia in terms of rating agencies as jpmorgan raised the weight of colombian debt in its emerging markets index after lowering brazil from its embi ig indicator with this the country gained  percentage points in the weighting of the index and reached  from  with this it is expected that more dollars will enter the colombian market through foreign portfolio investmentecopetrol and avianca low issue price diego franco a stockbroker explained that the situation of the shares has two messages the first of them is that for the ordinary investor the fact of seeing that in the market below its emission generates distrust because the investor is he makes the idea that if he had invested in the stocks that they promoted so much he would be losing money right now the second is that the investor must be clear that it is a situation that is giving him a historic opportunity in colombia to invest agustin vera director of quantitative strategies at global seurities assured that after  the country began to see better economic growth numbers and the international perception improved since there were decreases in inflation reduction in unemployment so the stock indexes were growing above  with expectations of longterm economic behavior people were willing to pay several times the book value of the companies as longterm valuations of this kind were expected which generated a great boom in emissions and in a market where foreign investment had arrived in  vera pointed out among these actions is the case of ecopetrol one of the most important companies for the country this company made its first share issue in  when it issued  million shares worth   each at the end of the session it awarded   million there is no doubt that it was a promising company and that in subsequent years it was one of the most profitable in the country with very attractive returns for its investors however at present despite the fact that there is still a lot of confidence in the company the situation that happens is not favorable since its action has been greatly affected by the fall in oil prices since at this moment it is below its issue price and is traded at a value close to   this means that the asset has lost about  of course if we compare it with the issue of  when the price was   the share has fallen around  it should be noted that the market foresees a longterm recovery and that it reaches an average of   thanks to the measures it is taking such as cutting costs franco pointed out that in the case of ecopetrol it had two issues and the fact of seeing it for   the investor who does not know the market feels cheated the most prepared investor can buy that stock with those low prices it is an opportunity  but the situation is not different for the avianca airline share which in  made its exit to the bvc with  million preferred shares that meant   million since the value per share was   one of the peaks that this species had was in january  when it was quoted at   since then the stock began a sharp decline until it reached a value close to   that is investors who bought in the issue have lost around of  the most important airline in the country has been affected by the strong devaluation of the peso against the dollar which has generated a drop in demand for international tickets economic rhythm in the world and with a reduction of expectations in growth in latin america airlines are affected because when people do not grow monetarily they begin to cut trips and luxuries also with issues such as ebola and zika which seem unimportant issues but make the appetite to travel diminish said the expert rebuilding the stock some stocks in the construction sector have also not fared well and their shares are below the first market exit price construcciones el condor since its issuance in  has dropped by around  this if one takes into account that it went from   to   for its part the cemex share issued the same year at a value of   has fallen  to   constructura conconcreto does not escape the same situation because these days the species is at   losing  compared to the issue price the analysts consulted assure that the sector would recover this year since it has always been a leader in the colombian economy and has shown a reduction in exponential growth but it will continue to be positive they will also be assets that will generate profitability finally agustin vera indicated that longterm investors should not worry because in the long term a great recovery is expected another positive day for the bvc indices yesterday the colcap market capitalization index gained  to  points for its part colsc rose  to  units while colir rose  to  points on the other hand pacific ep stock was the stock that stood out the most on the day rising  to   grupo argos followed with a  rise to   among those that fell the most were valsimesa which fell  to   and empresa de energia de bogota eeb with a  drop and a closing price of   opinions agustin vera analyst at global securities with the arrival of foreign investment and the good projections people wanted to pay several times the book value of the companies diego franco stockbroker when seeing the shares below the issue value two messages are generated one is the opportunity to invest the other is mistrust ecopetrol began financing the  investment plan with an international loan for us   million this loan would have a  term amortizable with a  grace period on principal and interest payable semiannually at a libor rate   basis points cost conditions similar to those of the international syndicated loan obtained by ecopetrol in february   explained the company this would be the first loan requested by the company to begin financing the  investment plan which in total and initially would have investments of us   billionthe ecopetrol firm began financing its  investment plan this operation was carried out through a bilateral commercial loan for us   million with the bank of tokyomitsubushi ufj ltd which will have a term of  years amortizable with a  grace period on principal and interest payable semiannually at a libor rate   basis points it is good that ecopetrol begins to invest these resources although perhaps in the short term the market will take it on a regular basis because it is finally acquiring a liability in the long term it will be positive since the state company needs to deliver good news so that its titles take greater value  explained the stockbroker diego franco the company also reported through a statement that this operation shows that ecopetrols access to competitive sources of financing is maintained as well as its perception as an investment grade company additionally they ratify confidence in the companys ability to face this international situation of lower oil prices however last friday the risk rating agency sp lowered the perspective of its ecopetrol rating from stable to negative this movement joins the one recently carried out by the moodys agency in which it also lowered ecopetrols rating from  to  due to cash problems the firm is havingecopetrol shareholders would not receive dividends this year according to juan carlos echeverry in dialogue with caracol radio the official said that the government the majority shareholder of the oil company with  stake has shown its interest in not distributing dividends and has expressed its support for the company regarding costs echeverry said that they continue to reduce them and that only in january the reduction goal in this item was us   million finally the president of ecopetrol confirmed that on june   campo rubiales and quifa will once again be under the control of the companyecopetrol shareholders suffer from low oil prices in the last political control debate that was held against the minister of finance mauricio cardenas due to the economic situation of the country the senator from the democratic center ivan duque claimed to the government that the dividends distributed by ecopetrol were excessive and it is that last year  of the profits of  were distributed and in previous years the percentage had reached  faced with this scenario the senator expressed the need to lower the percentage of profits distributed by the company so as not to undercapitalize it and to be able to improve investments in other areas of the firm this call not to decapitalize ecopetrol in profits to reinvest began to penetrate deeper into the ears of those responsible for the company when the rating agency moodys decided to lower the rating of the oil company from  to  due to its difficulties in generating cash flow and despite its plan to reduce spending and divestment of nonstrategic assets it was recently learned that it wants to sell its stake in propilco which had been bought for us   million in  given this the director of the national planning department and member of the board of directors of the oil company simon gaviria assured in an interview with bloomberg that the priority at this time considering the way in which the credit agencies are working is guarantee that ecopetrol maintains its investment grade level  and in that sense gaviria indicated that the dividend distribution project that the board will deliver to the shareholders meeting will be subject to meeting that goal to that statement by gaviria was added that of the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry who assured according to caracol radio that the minority investors of the company have certainly had a difficult year with a barrel of oil at about us   although the media does not say whether or not echeverry is in favor of distributing the profits of the company among its shareholders it did make it clear that this will be one of the issues to be discussed at the next meeting in addition according to caracol echeverry said that the government does not have among its accounts to receive dividends from the oil company this year the commission agent valora inversiones reached the same conclusion since in its last report on the companys situation they found that what the government expects from ecopetrols income for this year is that it finishes paying the dividends it owes it for  we find that the government is not scheduled to receive dividends from ecopetrols  profits since in december they had budgeted   billion in dividends and in january they adjusted their fiscal budget to receive dividends of   million which are the scheduled pending dividends and authorized by the assembly of march    said the reportmercado welcomes the fact that ecopetrol does not distribute dividends lr conducted a survey among market analysts most of whom agree that the healthiest thing for the company is not to distribute dividends experts say this would be positive as long as the money is used for exploration projects which in the long term will generate positive expectations for the company among those who say that it is best to distribute dividends they agree that these should be reduced and not distribute  of profits as has been done in recent years for jose david lopez an analyst at valoralta the company should not distribute dividends not even to retail shareholders ecopetrol is the company with the highest distribution of its profits to its shareholders in the world with  distribution a figure much higher than its peers likewise with this large distribution it stopped reinvesting in exploration with the current international situation in which oil prices are at levels not seen since  their income would drop significantly therefore there must be a policy to reduce costs and expenses said lopez for his part agustin vera an expert at global securities colombia indicated that when a company faces a negative scenario the owners generally make the decision to preserve capital either by reducing expenses investments or even the distribution of profits which is called dividends historically ecopetrol has made a high distribution of profits  which is not optimal for a company that is in a growth phase as ecopetrol supposedly was said vera who also stated that the best for a company in the the states situation is to reduce the dividend as much as possible but it does not doubt that political factors will be considered carlos anaya an analyst at casa de bolsa assured that the most convenient thing would be not to distribute dividends given the reduction of  in the investment plan this year compared to the previous one if these resources were used for exploration there would be better prospects for  and  periods in which a recovery in the price of crude could be expected  however he explained that the nondistribution of dividends would be harmful to shareholders who in addition to having lost  in the value of their investment in the last twelve months would not have profitability derived from dividends which could have repercussions in a even bigger drop in stock likewise it would be interesting to know how the nation is going to cover the lack of these resources for fiscal  david villan an analyst at adcap pointed out that the possibility of not distributing dividends is viable and is growing more and more when there are already several sources like the president of the oil company juan carlos echeverry who although he has not assured it has left to think that this may be a decision taken by the board and that it will be presented to the assembly at the end of march villan added that he would not be disappointed if ecopetrol did not distribute dividends given that bad decisions at this time can put even more pressure on the state company s cash flow peace of mind for shareholders according to market analysts consulted by lr the measure of not delivering dividends should not worry investors since the money that is not delivered could be reinvested in exploration projects which in the long term would give positive projections to the company camilo silva manager of valora inversiones pointed out that the investment plan was reduced by  and if it distributes  of the profits it will have to go into debt if its capex is production and exploration which would not be good opinions agustin vera analyst at global securities in a situation like the one that ecopetrol is going through it is best to reduce dividends as much as possible however political factors will weigh on the decision jose david lopez valoralta analyst the company should not distribute profits because in recent years it distributed more than  of the

operations of pan american energy a joint venture with a  stake in bp which carried out a multitude of projects in argentina bolivia uruguay peru chile and southern brazil  until  also within the same parent company he served as director of exploration and production which gives him all the credentials for his new positionecopetrol and petrobras the most impacted state firms although these two companies lead the list of the most impacted government according to the financial results reported during the third quarter of last year the truth is that in general companies in the sector in the region show a reduction in their profits and income for example ecopetrols sales went from us   million to us   million between  and  which corresponds to a  drop an even greater collapse was evidenced by petrobras which reached a variation of  for the same period of time seeing its revenues reduced by us   million the mexican pemex was another one that reported the most falls with a decrease of  while codelco from chile had revenues of us   million in  and us   million in  on the other hand the difference in the reduction of the venezuelan pdvsa between january and september  and  was us   millions the impact of oil exports on the economy of each country has been one of the factors that have triggered the problems in stateowned companies in fact according to eclac for  years trade in latin america did not have to assume such a dark scenario since regional exports fell  during  a figure higher than that registered in the  crisis of the oil companies in the united states when the securities on the stock market and their falls are compared in the stateowned companies of latin america the correlation of the loss in value with the decline in crude prices is more direct because here diversification it is not that big in comparison for example with the firms in the sector in north america explained agustin vera head of quantitative strategies at global securities however it must be recognized that cheap oil has hit the worlds two largest oil companies very hard exxon mobile and chevron reason why it is explained that from there down the rest of the companies are much more affected due to their fragile financial muscle this also includes the reason for the bad time of pemex petrobras ecopetrol and pdvsa the difference between the fate of one state and the other may consist in the future in what they have as a reserve because if there are not many they will be in difficulties said alvaro younes president of fedispetrol if in the world the comments of international analysts project the scenario of crude oil prices in a negative way it would be good for these companies to migrate to another type of energy such as propane gas even if it is of fossil origin added younes it could be the case of ecopetrol which between the first three quarters of  and  reported the smallest amounts for profits among the state companies it went from us   million to us   million the bad moment of this company is also reflected in its investment plan for  which will be us   billion that is  less than what was proposed for last year despite its size petrobras earnings were also very small reaching us   million in  and in  they were us   million which represented a variation of  for vera there are specific situations in each country that have affected the situation of each government company that is what has happened to petrobras hit by corruption scandals that plagued president dilma rousseff for its part pdvsa is suffering in the midst of the venezuelan macroeconomic context and is trying to resolve this year the payment of a debt of us   billion in mexico pemex will concentrate the largest cut in jobs in the public sector which represents  jobs and it is estimated that there could be more sp downgraded codelco to a  low copper prices put pressure on chilean company codelcos credit rating which went from aa to a  according to diario

capital to the chilean government in the form of dividends or additional taxes and is projected to continue even after the investment phase opinions agustin vera head of quantitative strategies of global securities in the region there is a direct correlation between the fall in the price of crude oil and the decrease in the prices of company shares alvaro younes president of fedispetrol the difference between some and other firms may consist of what they have as an oil reserve if there is not much they will be in difficultiesreficars construction contract was made by ecopetrol glencore this pronouncement would then be another responsibility that falls on the board of directors of ecopetrol and reficar since the news of these days and in the report that the comptroller general of the republic had delivered it was indicated that glencore had been responsible for carrying out this contract under the modality of reimbursable costs through a press release in response to what glencore said ecopetrol assured that the initial epc contract from which the current epc contract was derived was entered into by reficar with cbi on november   at which time glencore was the controlling and majority shareholder of reficar whose manager was richard cohen appointed by glencore the state company added that this initial epc contract was held by reficar under the direction of glencore in development of the commitment it assumed in the framework investment agreement dated october   the investigations of the colombian authorities cover the entire execution of the project  which includes the initial hiring of cbi reficars epc construction contract was made by ecopetrol as they pointed out when they learned about the investigations that are being carried out in the country and as a result of what has been said where it is indicated that they were the ones who transferred the construction through that contract to cbi they explain that by selling the shares of reficar in july  only left some designs and minimal construction work and clarified that the contract for the construction of the expansion of the refinery epc was carried out freely by ecopetrol without participation or influence from glencore and later glencore sold its stake in reficar to ecopetrol  this being the case the responsibility of the swissbased energy company and all the commitment to choose what has been labeled as a lousy contractor would be lost in part in addition the modality called reimbursable costs would be in question which means that the contractor was paid for the delivery of invoices and that it had increases on more than four occasions it would fall on the board of reficar and ecopetrol in fact according to the comptrollers report one of the modifications to the scope of the contract with cbi for engineering activities in  procurement of  and construction in  generated an additional value of us   million the highest of additions this being the case it will also be necessary to analyze what other responsibilities fall on reficar for not exercising the necessary control over the contractor since as the experts point out the changes they proposed had to be reviewed with a magnifying glass since each modification meant a large amount of money in the matter of settings and time cost overruns that you agree to refill according to reyes reinoso president of the refinery at the peak of productivity the very costly work stoppage occurred that generated losses of about us   million and accounted for more than  days with the work paralyzed additionally at the end of the project there was an exchange control since profitability fell according to reinoso this normally happens in projects upon completionthe prosecution says that the ministry of finance and the president of ecopetrol have acted with transparency in the reficar case the process concludes that so far no participation in these events has been deduced from the current minister of finance and public credit mauricio cardenas or the current president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry the control body assured that the information collected and analyzed so far makes it possible to determine that the officials who have acted with total transparency the purpose of the investigation is to find information related to the possible destruction alteration and concealment of material evidence for this it was ordered to carry out search procedures at the refinery offices located in bogota and cartagena through these procedures thousands of documents and information related to the contractual processes and accounting of the companies were collected reficar cbi and foster additionally raids were carried out in the homes of three cbi officials where laptops and removable hard drives were seized which possibly contain useful information for the process said the entity given that the hearing process is in progress the prosecutors office continues to analyze the evidence collected and carry out the other investigative proceedings once it is finished the call for questioning or charges will be arranged if there is anyecopetrol announces new adjustments to save   billion this year as announced by the company through a statement published by the financial superintendency the budget for operating expenses in all areas will be frozen at  in addition the company will be reorganized to take over the operation of the rubiales and cusiana fields see this is how ecopetrol works with a barrel of crude at us   within the measures the financing needs will also be adjusted to a range between us   billion and us   billion and expects to raise between us   million and us   million between this and next year with the divestment plan in nonstrategic assets ecopetrol also announced that it will freeze the personnel plant and the hiring of consultancies and professional services that are not strictly necessary for the operation will be canceled see ecopetrol shareholders suffer from low oil prices lastly a third of the investment in advertising and sponsorships will be cut a policy of shock will be adopted with the efficient use of inventories and the investment plan for this year will be based on the evolution of the international price of crude oilwith oil at us   ecopetrol lowers its savings to   trillion in this sense one of the measures that most impacted the company is the reduction in savings which would lower   trillion it should be remembered that the oil company exceeded the savings goal for  which was   billion as a business group of this amount   million correspond to the parent company which is ecopetrol sa among the main measures announced through a press release are the freezing of  of the budget for operating expenses in all areas the stagnation of the staff except in some cases essential critical for the operation decrease in travel budget eliminate consulting and professional services cutting back on advertising and prioritizing business with group companies but not with third parties regarding the freezing of the personal plant the entity made the reservation of internal reorganization to take over the operation in the rubiales and cusiana fields the financing of the company in  was us   million for  according to the required adjustments the financing will range between us   billion and us   billion according to analysts these measures are positive for the company in its desire to overcome the crisis over the price of crude sebastian gallego an analyst at credicorp capital stated that the announcement serves to mitigate a little the strong effect from oil prices for this reason the cost reduction plan programmed for this  adds up to savings of   billion in  which was much higher than the planned one which was   billion  according to the analyst this reduction does not include the investment of nonstrategic assets which would average between us   million and us   million the ecopetrol statement concluded that the package of measures strengthens the financial metrics as well as preserving the investment grade of the company in addition it is expected that in  the relationship between debt and ebitda would range between  times and  times contemplating a progressive decrease in the coming yearsecopetrol no longer wants to be listed on the toronto stock exchange the decision that was made by the board of directors in the ordinary meeting of january   was due to the analysis of the low volume of adrs operated in canada and the existence of a liquid market for adrs in the stock exchange of new york and for common shares in the local colombian market through the colombian stock exchange which allow interested investors to acquire a stake in ecopetrol  the oil company announced through a statement published in the financial superintendence that the time and administrative efforts involved in maintaining said adrs listed on the toronto stock exchange were also taken into account thus ecopetrol will continue to trade on the new york stock exchange and ordinary shares on the colombian stock exchangeecopetrol will review goals of the  plan by situation the first well to be reviewed is cano sur este which at some point was cataloged as the new star of the company since after six years of searching of making several discoveries and drilling  wells between explorations stratigraphic knowledge and delimiters as explained by the colombian association of geologists and geophysicists ecopetrol announced that it would add  million barrels of heavy crude to its proven reserves and was already generating  barrels per day however with oil at us   the anh authorized the suspension since taking into account that the efficiencies applied and analyzed by ecopetrol it cannot be profitable in the short term similarly the company continues to evaluate the rest of the wells in the country since the studies vary greatly from day to day due to the volatility of international crude prices therefore and based on preliminary analysis by larrain vial campetrol and jpmorgan it is likely that the companys reserve levels that are commercially viable will decrease up to  with an impact on the companys longterm production objectives in other words with the prices and current technology of the company it is better to leave that oil in the subsoil which effectively means that the reserves that the company presents no longer reach eight years but probably five explained daniel pardo  economic and sector director of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol now to this panorama affected by prices and to the uncertainty that exists in several regions of the eastern plains due to new projects that may no longer be carried out the latest audit report from the office of the comptroller general of the republic cgr is added which indicated its concern because deficiencies were evidenced in the development of activities and programs associated with the planning controls and coordination of the areas involved in the development of some selected projects which had about  of the budget of the period studied by the entity in addition against the reserves the cgr warning was also added stating that contingent resources could not be added for  million barrels of oil equivalent despite the fact that  of the resources were paid or spent to reach those proposed since most of the wells explored were abandoned or suspended for various reasons this being the case it is likely that from now on the companys goals will have to be rewritten especially those of the  plan since only in  a reduction in production of  is expected in this context the goal of reaching  barrels per day by  will not be met either since for the next two years the company will not have the necessary strength to make the investment that this requires now not everything is negative since as camilo silva cofounder of valora inversiones explained the companys cost reduction has proven to be effective which will probably give them some profit margin in the same way he added it must be understood that it is going to be a year of rearrangement and the goals will also depend on the adjustments made by the national government since the company is the most in need of support and tax exemptions the analysts also highlighted the decision to remove the stock from the toronto stock exchange since according to what they point out it is a simple procedure with which what is paid for trading on a stock exchange in which ecopetrol does not move very much would be recovered in addition cenit and reficar are also expected to give a good profit margin since they are not directly affected by the price of crude oil first company sanctioned by guarantees santa maria petroleum one of the three companies that was being investigated by the anh for presenting false guarantees to support some oil projects would be the first sanctioned in the case it is good to remember that in recent days the agency had declared the expiration of the exploration and production contracts in  valle medio del  and valle superior del  all awarded in development of the round colombia  procedure and subscribed with the companies optima oil corporation and range resources limited also involved in the case opinions daniel pardo director of campetrol research although the estimates indicated more than eight years in reserves with the current price it is not economically attractive camilo silva cofounder of valora inversiones ecopetrol has some very big challenges but achievable due to the strength and competent people it has to achieve the proposed goalsat the moment it is not appropriate to sell ecopetrol shares says cardenas in fact he explained that if oil does not rise to us   per barrel the price at which the oil company stabilizes an extremely conservative dividend policy will be maintained for four or five years on previous occasions he also explained that this policy could even consider that this year and the next one will not receive any contribution for this item from the oil company finally he pointed out that it is necessary to financially support the company especially with the asset divestment plan that the company is already carrying out with the sale of shares in isa propilco and empresa de energia de bogota eeb with which has been estimated that up to us   million could be raised which would not affect the operation of the company which today and in the future will focus on being a company that mainly extracts oil and gasecopetrol signed a loan with bancolombia to finance investments the loan has a term of eight years repayable with a twoyear grace period on capital as explained by the oil company interest will be paid semiannually at a dtf ta   basis points rate the company fulfilled all the procedures and approvals required by the competent governmental entities in colombia before the closing of the operation including the authorization resolution no  of february   of the ministry of finance and public credit he concludedwith  appointments the leadership that structures ecopetrol was ready of the  senior management positions  occurred in  as it sought to integrate a luxury team that will carry out the strategy to face the challenges that we will have in the coming years echeverry said additionally the organizational structure was adjusted in accordance with the  plan and was divided into three large groups in the first place was the operations section in charge of the executive vicepresidency which consolidates all areas of the value chain felipe bayon entered this position in november as a replacement for camilo marulanda the mechanical engineer from universidad de los andes worked for more than  years at bp two new vice presidents entered this operational category tomas hernandez in refining and juan pablo ospina in the commercial vicepresidency hernandez worked for more than  years at chevron and ospina for his part who came to replace claudia castellanos who retired has worked at exxon mobil and the colombian state company the second major section is control and it brings together the corporate and support areas this was where the biggest change was felt as seven new managers entered in the first place the functions of the general secretary were divided the latter which was in charge of margarita maria escobar who replaced margarita obregon and supports the presidency and is related to the board of directors for her part the work of social responsibility agreements and communications was in charge of maria consuelo rodriguez who previously worked in the ministry of finance and the national planning department in addition in this area of control the compliance vicepresidency was established which was previously a directorate and integrated the prevention detection and sanction functions of internal control this area was in charge of maria juliana alban who comes from the comptrollers office among the other changes maria fernanda suarez was appointed as the replacement of magda manosalva who is now in ecopetrol america in the corporate and finance vice presidency and eduardo uribe the countrys first vice minister of environment in the vice presidency of sustainable development in the area of innovation and technology andres mantilla an engineer from the industrial university of santander with  years of experience in the sector and camilo vela as legal vice president replacing the now member of the constitutional court alejandro linares in addition the third category transformation was created which was in charge of carlos vargas and will leverage competitiveness and the successful implementation of the  strategy now in the face of changes and staff cuts that have employees concerned he explained that the dismissals of  people that have been mentioned are basically contractors a payroll that was reduced  from  workers to  for their part plant employees who today number  compared to  in  are expected not to be affected opinions juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol we renewed our management team and we achieved a luxurious payroll to carry out the strategy and face the challenges that we will have in the coming years diego franco stock broker the market welcomes these changes as they allow ecopetrol to do the same with less be more efficient and have a lower tax burden on salariesecopetrol made its exit from the canadian stock exchange official on march  ecopetrols foray into the canadian stock market lasted five years and six months on august   the country learned of the request of the company at that time chaired by javier gutierrez permberthy to expand its presence in international markets with the entry of its adr american depositary receipt to the extreme north of the continent on august   which fell friday gutierrez opened the toronto stock exchange it should be remembered that each ecopetrol adr represents a package of  ordinary shares of the company that are traded on the stock market when ecopetrol launched its adr the american market was the place for any investor to trade his link with the canadian stock exchange has more to do with or originate from his commitments with his current partner pacific rubiales but in terms of volumes it was not very representative fenix valor manager orlando santiago told lr for his part juan felipe pinzon head of professional economic investigations at the stock exchange points out that in canada the action was considered low operation and the decision to withdraw is in line with the austerity plan proposed by the colombian oil company investors see this with very good eyes ecopetrols adr will disappear from the toronto stock exchange from march  it should not be forgotten that it all started on august   when with great fanfare the then president of the oil company javier gutierrez pemberthy opened the operations of the toronto stock exchange this event occurred three days after the companys listing in that market was approved the firm stressed that his arrival was an important step in the strategy of positioning in the international capital markets five years and six months later market analysts take stock of what was ecopetrols adventure in the extreme north of america for diego franco consultant and expert in the stock market ecopetrols experience in canada ends up giving the company a good rating it was positive because the requirements are very demanding in an oil exchange but clearly there were more attractive titles he said along the same lines alejandro reyes director of economic research at ultraserfinco considered that having been in the canadian market served ecopetrol as a mechanism of exposure to the niche market because the toronto stock exchange is specialized in the mining sector however it did not have a real benefit of obtaining resources through that stock market  for his part juan felipe pinzon head of economic investigations of professionals of the stock market pointed out that the first two years were a striking action by investors but in recent times capital was diverted to other raw materials an episode that was on the table in the last three years was also decisive in defining the exit from canada orlando santiago manager of fenix valor considered that the link with the canadian stock exchange is more related to the commitments with its partner pacific rubiales but in terms of volumes it was not very representative  santiago added that with the bad time that ecopetrol spent with pacific in the rubiales field it led canadian investors to lose their interest additionally ecopetrol indicated that its securities will continue to be traded on the new york stock exchange where they are traded at a sum of us   the share of the oil company closed in green on the bvc this thursday on the colombian stock exchange the share of the oil company ended the day registering a  appreciation which meant an increase in its price of   leaving the title starts today with a value of   so far this year as of february  the colombian oil company has appreciated  if it is remembered that the start of the year did so at a price of   a lower figure of   opinions omar suarez analyst at alianza valores fabricatos positive results were influenced by the appreciation of the dollar which is why it had a good day in the stock market yesterday orlando santiago manager and founding partner of fenix valor his link with the canadian stock exchange has more to do with or originate in his commitments with his current partner which was pacific rubiales but it was not very representativehit in reserves and fall in dividend which is expected for ecopetrol meeting the first to place the bets was btg pactual which noted that the life of the states reserves could be as low as  years that is a  drop compared to the  million barrels of crude equivalent mbpe revealed in the report that was presented on february  of the previous year however they explain that the letters of other experts speak of a fall of up to  now as explained by the commission agent the drop to  mbpe is estimated taking the production of   average barrels per day and a negative revision of  million barrels due to a possible exit from projects that are no longer financially viable with current prices  in fact according to sources from the sector this week with the date of the meeting defined the suspension of five projects could also be revealed due to a fall in price now as the companys analysts explained it is difficult to establish how much has been discounted from this fall in the stock since despite the fact that the market knows in part that a good percentage of reserves was not going to be profitable for the price extract ecopetrol if it is below the replacement index of its peers in the region the commission agent in the case of expectations for results explained that they are likely to be weak although there will be a slight recovery of  in production reaching  barrels and good results in the transportation and refining segment the next projection was from alianza valores and he pointed out that although he sees unlikely that ecopetrol will return to  figures in the short term since although the current situation of the firm and the sector is different there are several very similar numbers thus revenues for  of   billion are expected a profit of   billion and a production of  barrels which would generate a drop in dividends taking into account that the oil company reported that it will discuss the project to distribute profits in addition they estimate that the decline in revenues would occur by about  for  if brent oil averages us   per barrel the dollar at   and production at  barrels likewise they explained that ecopetrol faces the risks that due to the price of a barrel below us   not only will its reserves decrease but also that its debt indicators will deteriorate finally corredores daviviendas analysis indicates that there would be a downward revision of reserves of between  and  with a more probable scenario of  that is the index in terms of years could be reduced by two going from  years to  years well below its comparable peers likewise they highlight that in the last two years the increase in reserves has occurred in large proportion due to the revision of existing reserves rather than the discovery of new wells or the great impact of factor recovery techniques thus they consider a negative impact for the action in the market taking into account the current price of oil downward revision in national crude oil production in addition to the alert presented by the president of campetrol ruben dario lizarralde regarding the decrease in the countrys reserves from  years to  years due to the brake on several projects of exploration it was learned that the government once again reduced the production goal from  barrels to  in addition if the price does not recover for the second half it could be revised below  barrels a day opinions ruben dario lizarralde president of campetrol the national government must take actions that give messages abroad to recover investment especially in exploration which is slowed at  diego franco stockbroker in reserves the country is aware that the figures are going to continue to deteriorate and the market has already assumed that bad reading that we are going to see in a few daysecopetrol and canacol shareholders meetings already have dates at the meeting which will take place at the international business and exhibition center corferias in bogota the  management report will be presented by the board of directors and the companys senior executive the individual and consolidated financial statements as of december   will be read and among other aspects the board will deliver a report on its operation evaluation of the president and development and compliance with the code of good governance similarly the company in the hydrocarbon sector canacol energy will hold its annual general and special shareholders meeting on april  in bogota as reported to the financial superintendence on the other hand the grupo familia board of directors approved the project for the distribution of profits and equity movements for the taxable year  and  to be presented to the shareholders meeting among the considerations of the firm is to appropriate all of the profits of fiscal year  for   million and distribute them to the reserve for future capitalizations the sum of   million to the reserve for future dividend distributions the sum of   million and to the reserve for flexible depreciation the sum of   million thus the total amount of   billion is expected to be distributed as ordinary dividends equivalent to   per share for  million shares outstanding according to grupo familia reported to the superfinanciera these dividends will be paid in twelve successive monthly payments of   million equivalent to   per share from april  to march mercado is waiting for asset prices from the oil company ecopetrol this being the case in addition to the sale of the shares of the bogota energy company eeb and of electric interconnection isa which have a price per share of   and   which would collect about   billion it would be necessary to analyze how much the price of  of the shares of propilco will be estimated at   billion the value agreed with epm for  of invercolsa which in books would total   million and later the estimate of bioenergy this firm that is now in the sights because it would also have cost overruns in its construction it would be sold only after the new alcaravan plant begins to generate profits which is estimated to finally be ready for the last two months the idea with this last asset which has been ecopetrols second headache after reficar since it went from costing us   million in  to us   million in  and has had a threeyear delay for its entry is that finally in the second semester of this year it begins to generate profits that make it more attractive in the eyes of possible interested parties for the market these sales are initially viewed positively since it is considered that an oil company can be more efficient in the business that it manages and knows and can on the other hand win by selling alternative businesses which it currently manages but which in reality lacks of knowledge to do it  explained diego franco stockbroker in the same way experts from the sector say that part of the lesson was learned with reficar and that at present the most important thing for ecopetrol is that it begins to explore especially within the continent since they are much simpler projects  of us   million or us   million which would produce  barrels per day at a fixed rate and in which ecopetrol has experience franco clarified that for these sales to continue to be viewed positively the agreed price must include the investments made by ecopetrol in those assets so that the value at which they are delivered is not below and is not generated a loss when liquidating in front of propilco which was the complement of reficar in the beginning franco explained that the sale is equally assertive since the size of the refinery is  or  greater than what was initially proposed when it was looking for this synergy so reficars own infrastructure will supply what chemistry was expected to do which still remains a very attractive asset analysts from credicorp capital explained that this sale is attractive from the eyes of the market since it facilitates the financing needs of the main activity in a context of low oil prices however given that the sale must comply with law  the process is not imminent and it could take about three or four years for all cases what were the investments in biofuels despite the fact that years ago the governments support towards a transition from  fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly ones which had percentages of biofuels led to strong investments from the agricultural and industrial sector now the concern as explained to lr jorge bendeck director of fedebiocombustibles is that those promises remained in the future and of the  and  that the fuel formulas have it seems that it will not happen this being the case it would be necessary to analyze what will be the impact on profitability of the investments made such as ecopetrols diego francos opinion stockbroker an oil company with a cash box is better than a diversified one now the fact that ecopetrol has liquidity would allow it to take advantage of the sector ecopetrols reserves decreased  and would last for  years now despite the fact that this was the result that the stock market analysts were waiting for as btg pactual anticipated so no large movements are expected in the stock since the market has anticipated most of this and the ecopetrols performance will be more linked to oil prices at this time  it is worrying that the reserve replacement ratio was only  while in previous years it was  and  in  this is how only  mboe correspond to new drilling campaigns and positive reviews in some fields such as chichimene on the other hand in the face of new discoveries only  mboe were incorporated in the previous year that is  less than in  when  mbpe were added due to the incorporation of some gas fields which helped that in  it was possible to establish that the reserves would last for  years finally btg pointed out that the fall in reserves is likely to represent an impediment to spending that could erase the  earnings more so if one takes into account that total eni chevron and statoil were above the oil company which decreased their figures in a lower percentageecopetrol receives authorization to suspend the second field this year this request is for a temporary suspension since ecopetrol and partner in the field repsol cannot sustain costs and make them profitable with crude at us   per barrel despite the fact that they implemented several efficiency projects to see if they could do it profitable the field now as it is a temporary suspension it continues to analyze how to make it profitable to reactivate it the temporary suspension applies to the akacias production area of the  block which currently produces an average of  barrels per day of which  correspond to ecopetrol and  to repsol  continues to be a promising and strategic block that we hope to develop once market conditions improve  the company explainedfernan ignacio bejarano will be the replacement for alejandro linares in the legal vicepresidency of ecopetrol while the jurist who has a masters degree in law from the american university assumes the position he will continue to be replaced by camilo vela a lawyer who has been in charge of the area since alejandro linares left the company who retired to assume the position of magistrate in the constitutional court bejarano who comes to assume many challenges that the company has to meet its renewal for  has held different positions in the public and private sectors he was vice minister of foreign relations secretary of the monetary board secretary of the board of directors of banco de la republica advisor to the legal secretariat of the presidency of the republic legal vice president and secretary general of the colombian financial corporation among others explained the oil company through a statementecopetrol invested   million in roads according to a statement sent by the oil company to date  of the works have been completed with excellent results although the investment in this project is   million the municipality made a contribution of   million represented in heavy machinery required to carry out the work such as dump trucks motor graders and vibro compactors for its part the contribution made by ecopetrol in the work was   million  was delivered in cash and the remaining value was represented in asphalt the company reported that the neighborhoods benefiting from this investment were argelia carvajal buenos aires unidos las ferias gaitan los comuneros el progreso  de julio and urbanizacion arenales among others francisco javier cala laguna planning advisor for sabana de torres assured through the statement that these works impact the entire urban area of the municipality this is a collaboration between the two entities that work for the progress of the municipality and that benefits the community not only for the improvement of the roads but for the involvement of local labor  additionally nelson enrique duarte maldonado community leader of the july  neighborhood said that before we had to put up with the dust from the road now with the paved roads our quality of life has improved by one hundred percent since we can travel with ease ecopetrol closed  with losses of   billion and a  drop in sales juan carlos echeverry president of the company said in a statement that if it were not for the effects of accounting standards the company would have produced a net profit of   billion this accounting effect as well as the exchange difference constitute a record in the expense that affects the financial result but does not imply the use of cash impairments can be reversed once market conditions become more favorable except in the case of impairment due to goodwill  he explained total sales recorded a  drop from us   billion in  to us

he added that if market conditions improve this expense could be reversed but a full recovery cannot be expected either especially when the best estimates suggest a wti price of us   for  gsc estimate and us   to us   for the long term international energy agency according to what was said by the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry in the statement without the effect of impairments the company would have produced a net profit of   billion this accounting effect as well as the exchange difference constitute a record in the expense that affects the financial result but does not imply the use of cash  on the other hand the company reported that sales fell  to   billion in  from   billion in  for its part profit before taxes ebitda fell by  reaching   trillion in  when in  it was

billion in this context the president of the company juan carlos echeverry explained in a conference that as of   of the companys investments will be made in oil exploration and production after that the stock of the oil company is trading around  pm at   with an increase of  it should be remembered that when lr conducted a survey among analysts at the beginning of february asking whether or not the oil company should distribute a dividend the market consensus was that the distribution was minimal or that it did not at that time carlos anaya an analyst at casa de bolsa assured that the most convenient thing would be not to distribute dividends given the  reduction in the investment plan this year compared to the previous one if these resources were used for exploration there would be better prospects for  and  periods in which a recovery in the price of crude could be expected ecopetrols share rose  after the announcement of investments since  in his presentation echeverry showed that this will be a year of transition in which he will go from a company that invests in all parts of the oil chain  to one specialized solely in exploring and generating oil in this way these two segments of the company will receive  of the investment from  additionally this year the investments in cenit in the expansion of ocensa and in the chichimenecastilla triangle will end the last money

order to reach the goal of  drilling to maintain production and increase the companys reserves regarding the exploration strategy that ecopetrol will follow despite the fact that max torres vice president of the area explained that it will continue offshore with the drilling of kronos  in september and in  with orca  the investments will be destined to onshore fields which the company had forgotten these actions announced by the company were liked by the market not only because of the interest in increasing reserves but because they show greater realism on the part of the state company diego franco stock market analyst explained that ecopetrol is understanding throughout this financial crisis that the company has to be more modest in its ambitious plans to which it has used the market for many years and in that sense it has you have to focus on what will allow you to survive this whole conjuncture what will allow you to do that that it invests a high percentage in exploitation and production  on the other hand the analyst added that nowadays all companies have to evaluate their fields to see which are the most profitable if they dont they will disappear because they will dedicate their efforts to financially expensive blocks  in view of this echeverry explained that this analysis is currently being carried out one by one of the fields to see which ones continue to generate profitability under four aspects robust prices the rate of return cash generation and the contribution to the strategy to   finally the company announced that given the current

projects after the price of crude fell more than  in the last two years so they now face growing accounts in their backed giants state it is a general problem brazils state giant petroleo brasileiro sa is the worlds most indebted oil company while credit default swap operators are betting that there is a  chance that petroleos de venezuela sa known as pdvsa will go to a default in the next  months it is difficult there is no doubt said alberto ramos chief economist for latin america at goldman sachs group inc some of these companies accumulated heavy debt in the period when oil prices were high the bond risk measured by the credit default swap market has risen for latin american oil giants at a time when oilproducing companies in venezuela brazil and mexico have larger dollar debt than government debt supports them only the colombian ecopetrol sa has a lower debt petroleos mexicanos known as pemex which has the highest credit rating of the four already suffered a downgrade from moodys investors service in november and is under review with a view to another downgrade these results constitute a collective threat to the economy of the regionecopetrol achieved savings of   billion in production activities according to the company thanks to the drop in drilling days optimizations of   million were achieved and among the fields that managed to lower costs the most are castilla  chichimene  in the department of meta province  in santander tibu  in norte de santander and dina  and loma larga  in huila on the other hand savings of   million were achieved in diluent

the legislators are senators antonio navarro and jorge prieto from alianza verde jorge enrique robledo and alberto castilla from polo democratico sofia gaviria of the liberal party luis emilio sierra of the conservative party and the representative of the u party elda lucy contento among others the campaign which has been promoted by the tax justice network the union sindical obrera the central unitaria de trabajadores the general confederation of workers dignidad santandereana social forum of barrancabermeja dignidad agropecuaria magdalena medio trade union committee has as objective to avoid a detriment to ecopetrol this explains why they want to prevent plans such as the sale of propilco from advancing  which between january and september  reported sales of  billion pesos and that its accumulated profits reached  billion pesos  which was announced by the companys board of directors by qualifying it as a nonstrategic asset and through its sale collecting funds and strengthening the exploration and production businesses to this is added they say the socalled minor fields that represent  of ecopetrols production within the campaign a set of activities is expected that will include debates on political control academic forums promote citizen mobilizations but also implement legal strategies to defend the oil company likewise it is intended to give a boost to the company so that it is once again a strategic asset and promote the modernization of the barrancabermeja refinery meanwhile regarding the rumors of a possible sale of ecopetrol which increased after the sale of isagen minister mauricio cardenas said through twitter no one in the government has ever thought of selling ecopetrol that would not have no sense given current oil market conditions ecopetrol begins arbitration proceedings against cbi for us   billion through a press release the oil company announced that its subsidiary refinery submitted an application to the international chamber of commerce aimed at initiating an arbitration process against chicago bridge  iron company nv cbi uk limited and cbi colombiana sa collectively cbi  the decision was made by the execution and execution of the epc contract that was signed with this company for the expansion of reficar lr had already anticipated in february that if an agreement was not reached reficar would go to the arbitration court as announced today at that time both companies were collecting information to reach an agreement due to the alleged cost overruns that would have arisen in the project that according to the comptroller general ended up costing us   million company sources said a month ago that the idea was to collect enough information so that a direct agreement could be established and if necessary cbi would reimburse part of the money that could not be justified with the reficar contract as he explained in his capacity as plaintiff the refinery has set the claims of its demand at at least us   billionthis will be the board that the government proposes to the ecopetrol assembly all on account of the corporate governance policies and recommendations that the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd made to the government in  the departure of the ministry of mines was already announced in the board of directors of the state oil company and in the one where tomas gonzalez was sitting until recently the full board of the board of directors proposed by the ministry of finance to the president of the company juan carlos echeverry is made up of nine members of which seven are independent and two representatives of the government mauricio cardenas for the ministry of finance and simon gaviria for national planning in the seven independent members the departure of luis fernando ramirez acuna current president of the board of directors of ecopetrol he assumed the position since july  is noted in replacement of gonzalez and ramirez the government proposes jaime ardila as independent members who in july  announced his retirement from the presidency for south america of general motors the other candidate is gustavo adolfo carvajal sinisterra who comes from the carvajal foundation and has also been colombias ambassador to france in  and second vice president of the executive commission of the latin american business council ceal in  the other five independent members remain roberto steiner for minority shareholders horacio ferreira crude producing departments carlos cure and jorge pinzon it should be remembered that the recommendations of the oecd also contemplate the departure of two other state representatives on the board the next to come out is the director of the national planning department and finally the minister of finance the national government has a shareholding of ecopetrols assembly begins with only  shareholders the long lines that surrounded the capitals auditorium ended and in a much more modest venue and without any gift the ecopetrol shareholders meeting began now when the proposals of the minority shareholders began the first representative demanded the presence of the state since the minister of finance and the minister of mines and energy were conspicuous by their absence given this the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry took the voice and replied that like you and as a shareholder we suffered a difficult year the environment was tremendously challenging but today i want to tell you a story of hope and here we are to solve this and the other problems  during the presentation echeverry explained the difficult situation that prices have faced and the action that has fallen about  in one year less than pacific which fell  but more than statoil which fell  and petrobras with  but he stressed that scotia bank and other investment agencies pointed out that if someone wants to bet on oil they should do it with the iguana the manager highlighted that the improvement in the conditions of  contracts was achieved all of these were renegotiated at  of costs achieving savings of   billion for the business group of ecopetrols pretax profit was lost due to attacks environment and licenses additionally the manager pointed out that the previous year the payment of taxes reduced profits to a greater extent and went from   billion before taxes to   billion after income and cree wealth and other taxes however the manager pointed out that on the subject of taxes we must be positive for  since the minister of finance mauricio cardenas has mentioned a tax reform in the second semester because the government recognizes that people pay little and companies a lot we receive this idea with great satisfaction and we give it our full support explained the manager who added that hopefully the reform will materialize and next year we can see a lower burden than we saw this one now regarding the delivery of dividends the minority representative pointed out that in the past ecopetrol was the oil company that distributed the most dividends with a  margin when the average is  that is why last year it was he began to think about a delivery of dividends from the industry rule taking delivery to  or  and that is how the north we are going to be working should be like  faced with the nondelivery of dividends this year he added that if the company does not make a profit it is a mistake to distribute dividends as some shareholders ask for and the only way would be to borrow the company and that is not a good decision he explained finally he recalled that those who bought the paper at   in the first delivery of shares have had a rate of return higher than  and it is not similar to the one that was had two years ago but it is not badecopetrol assembly approves the board of directors proposed by the nation it was as follows minister of finance and public credit  not independent director of the national planning department  not independent gustavo adolfo carvajal siniterra  independent jorge pinzon sanchez  independent jaime ardila sanchez  independent carlos cure cure  independent joaquin moreno uribe  independent horacio ferreira rueda  independent nominated by the hydrocarbon producing departments exploited by ecopetrol roberto steiner sampredro  independent nominated by minority shareholders similarly ernst  young was assigned as statutory auditorecopetrol isagen and etb between which they will not distribute dividends in addition to the generator there are  other companies that will not pay dividends to their shareholders the most emblematic case is that of ecopetrol since it was a company used to distributing almost  of its profits to shareholders and this year its owners will not see a single penny the rumor that the company was not going to give dividends began at the beginning of this year when the government revealed the new financial plan of the nation since there it could be clearly seen that it did not have the money that would accrue from the state company among its accounts  that rumor materialized when the companys billionaire losses in    trillion were seen even the representative of the retailers on the board roberto steiner agreed with this decision and explained that if the company does not make a profit it does not make sense that it distributes dividends because its only alternative to get that money would be to go into debt for david villan analyst at commission agent adcap there are others like ecopetrol where the investor considered a dividend one of the attractions to be able to invest in the stock taking into account that its profitability was high however the decision this year was not to distribute it which may upset the shareholder but it is well seen from the market since what they have to do is reinvest to stay current and continue to grow  another of the companies that left its investors with a frown was etb in an even more paradoxical case at the beginning of the government of enrique penalosa one of the few leaders of the previous administration who had a chance to stay in his post was saul kattan because of what had been his management at the head of the capital company in the end the new mayor decided to relieve kattan and put jorge castellanos in his place with this change and with the application of the niif rules in just a few weeks the company went from being one of the strong candidates to finance the metro by way of decumulation of reserves to a firm in the red when he presented the results for the  fiscal year castellanos was emphatic in pointing out that the company had made losses of   million and   million the previous year and now there is even talk of an eventual sale of the capital company given this villan explained as the comptrollers office had done that the companys problem is that it made very large investments and that they have not yet been able to provide the desired profitability in the same situation the shareholders of these three companies are those of cemex une epm la hipotecaria paz del rio banco mundo mujer odinsa itau colombia surtigas coltejer and fabricato however next year could be better since felipe pinzon head of economic research at profesionales de bolsa indicated that we hope that next year the distribution of dividends will be better than it is this year although he indicated that it may it becomes customary for oil companies not to distribute dividends cemex shareholders will not see profits last year was not the best for cemex in the country despite being in the construction sector which is one of those that marks the colombian economy the devaluation of the peso hit the results of the company very hard which reports in dollars that is why when the board of directors met with the shareholders in the general assembly the decision they reached was not to distribute profits they were   million and instead distribute the money in the fiscal reserve and occasional with the latter account as the main protagonist which received   million in addition the board of directors was ratified opinions david villan strategist in shares of adcap there are some companies that have not been paying dividends nor will they pay this year such as cemex latam holdings and pacific juan felipe pinzon head of cat economic performance of stock market professionals for this year we expect a better performance of the local stock market evidenced by a  advance in colcap in the current yearwith a price of up to us   ecopetrol fields are reactivated as explained by the manager with crude oil at us   cano sur would be revived and with us   the  project would be activated which in january had to be suspended he pointed out that until they get there it will be very difficult to reactivate them that does not mean that they are not great projects they are very promising the other thing we have is to lower costs so that both things are found and made viable sooner  thus and with these figures it is expected to recover the good news that was experienced in  when ecopetrol delivered the highest value of dividends to the companys shareholders   per share and distributed  of its profits than in that year they reached   billion thus with figures echeverry hopes to regain the confidence that was not felt this year in the xviii assembly of shareholders of the oil company which was attended by only  people who tried to intervene in the assembly for the  minority shareholders it has the company and that this year they did not receive dividends since the company in  presented a loss of   billion now among the proposals that were heard from the few shareholders who stayed until the end when the vote was taken to approve the dividend it was that a payment be made to minority shareholders with the money from accounting penalties that were they gave in  that is   billion or that the payment was made with   billion which were the initial profits without the notorious penalties for the entry of the niif regulations with this result the companys financial vice president maria fernanda suarez explained in turn that the legal reserve as of december   went from   trillion to   trillion due to the drop in profits this being the scenario this was the most controversial assembly that the company has had despite the fact that president echeverry tried to explain to shareholders that the future will be better since they will start investing between  and   of the money in exploration and production  in refining and  in transportation with this it is expected to make certain reserves such as those of the la cira infantas field to which  million barrels could be added together with occidental de colombia since it would be drilled in other sands that were not previously taken into account there oxy would initially invest us   million and pointed out that if we found it we would go half and half what for us is a win and win he explained also new opportunities in mature fields such as the villetacaballos formation which would have an estimated  million reserves and fields in magdalena medio and putumayo on the other hand according to the representative of the minorities roberto steiner improvements are expected in the companys production since  was strongly hit by physical and legal security issues in addition to the fall in oil prices and stocks that yesterday had no variation and closed at   the problems differed  barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year which is equivalent to revenues of about   million explained the manager who added that the previous year the payment of taxes reduced profits to a greater extent and went from   trillion before taxes to   billion after income and believe wealth and other taxes however he pointed out that on the issue of taxes we must be positive for  since the minister of finance mauricio cardenas has mentioned a tax reform in the second semester that we received with great satisfaction now one of the strong complaints from the minority who have very few shares is that steiner does not represent their interests so a change was proposed or to include another member on the board of directors who was chosen by vote among all the minorities and not just the  largest which are mostly pension funds faced with this last proposal echeverry indicated that he will collect the idea to raise it before the board for a statutory reform in other words having two minority shareholders one with whom colombians feel more identified finally the president of the company highlighted that the money invested in contracting fell  reaching   billion thanks to the renegotiation of  contracts which were lowered by  at the end of the assembly echeverry also highlighted that in ten years they will seek to go from  to  in the recovery factor which would add  million barrels us   million have been invested in barranca faced with the proposal of some minority shareholders to use some capitalizations to modernize the barrancabermeja refinery the president of the oil company juan carlos echeverry explained that at the moment it is not possible since they would be necessary us   million however he explained that the refinery is not to be scrapped as mentioned since in the last five years us   million have been invested to upgrade some plants and include the hydrotreatment plant that removes sulfur from the products juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol there is a strengthening to receive the rubiales and cusiana fields on the first and fourth of july with  million barrels of reserves roberto steiner representative of the minority last year we began to think about a dividend delivery of  or  and this should be the north in which we are going to be workingecopetrol obtained   million in the auction of isa shares although the first auction that the oil company made of these shares a month ago was not successful the colombian stock exchange bvc reported that in the second auction held today ecopetrol managed to sell  million shares of isa additionally the bvc reported that the price at which the shares were sold was   bringing the total amount awarded to   million the completion date for the delivery of the papers will be april  finally the bvc explained that the auction was for xstream under the swiss species with a balanced price match methodologyecopetrol still owns  million shares of isa the securities were placed at a price of   per share that is   above the minimum offer price which was   per share according to the oil company the magnitude of the operation of yesterdays auction is equivalent to  trading days of the share and isa in the ordinary session felipe pinzon head of economic research at profesionales de bolsa pointed out that of the total shares that ecopetrol owned in isa it managed to allocate  a percentage of sale that is considered as something positive to the extent that with this new income the company makes compliance with its divestment plan in nonstrategic assets to increase its cash flow and avoid a reduction in its credit rating  the analyst recalled that from the beginning isa declared that there would be four auctions in the sale process the first was declared void in the second there was a remainder of  and he assured that in the third and in case there is a fourth it is expected to sell the entire stake of the oil company in isa for now the publication of the date of the third operation is expected for his part ricardo sandoval strategy professional at global securities stated that i find it a bit curious that ecopetrol has not managed to sell all of the shares taking into account that isas share reached levels of   and ecopetrol i was selling it at a minimum price of   suddenly it was a matter of volume depth  sandoval added that the amount ecopetrol received from the sale of the companys shares will be designated mainly for the companys general expenses and perhaps for some exploration expenses since if it is a significant inflow of cash that is going to benefit the state oil company in the short term  likewise ecopetrol indicated that by adding the result of this process plus that of the first round of sale of the shares of empresa de energia de bogota eeb which took place in  resources have already been obtained for more than   million within the aforementioned nonstrategic asset divestment program which was approved by the national government through decree  of  what comes with the remaining shares in development of the second stage of the disposal program carried out by ecopetrol and having already carried out the second auction the oil company reported that it is empowered to advance up to two additional auctions with respect to the remaining amount of the shares that is  millions however the global securities analyst considers it likely that in the third auction i do the company will finish selling the remaining ones he also highlighted that the award of the shares yesterday was quite positive since it was possible to sell them above the minimum price opinion ricardo sandoval analyst at global securities i find it curious that ecopetrol has not managed to sell all the shares it has in isa in the second auctionmalaysia granted ecopetrol a patent for producing diesel without sulfur and aromatics the idea of the process developed at the colombian petroleum institute is to obtain a biofuel called biocetano which results from the addition of hydrogen to the oils to eliminate oxygen this biofuel is compatible with petroleum diesel and gives engines performance properties superior to those of today the product does not contain sulfur or aromatics which has a great impact on the protection of the environment and on the fuel market biocetane is more efficient in diesel engines because it has a high number of cetane the company explained in a statement in colombia ecopetrol already has a patent for the product and already filed an application for intellectual protection in  in the united states brazil europe and indonesiaecopetrol was the share that gained the most in the session as for the colsc liquidity index it rose  to  units and the colir rose  to  units the day which was marked by the green color in the transactions of the stock market left ecopetrol with the most important rise during the session the price of this title grew  closing at   this wednesday terpels papers will start the day at   after registering an advance this tuesday in its price of  in both companies the explanation given by market analysts consulted by lr is linked to the good performance of the price of oil in international markets this taking into account the announcement made by saudi arabia on the other hand the preferred share of avianca holdings pfavh also registered an appreciation of  in the bvc and will start trading this wednesday with a price of   it should be remembered that at the beginning of this week the new president of the airline hernan rincon was introduced who came with the idea of focusing his strategy on customer service diego franco a stock market consultant told lr that there are two issues that every investor must take into account one is that oil is breaking resistance and continues to show increases of  in its listed price we can see increases until friday the second issue is the effect it has on the dollar if the currency breaks that floor of   that has been weakening it will also have a very strong momentum for these reasons it is suggested to the public to stay in shares and especially in those that are indebted to the market  however not everything was in positive territory during the session of the colombian stock exchange among the securities with the greatest decline in the day the most important was pacific prec with a negative variation of  to   there was also depreciation in the paper of the paz del rio steel company with a negative variation of  to   and the group closes in red the titles of odinsa when registering a fall of  and starting today at priced at  ecopetrol does not see crude oil prices above us   the balance between spending and income must be managed in a very delicate way the tax reform is a link for that he noted the executive points out that in the next two years he expects hard things and where the prices in the next two years we will see between us   and us   and i even think that in five years we can see in the best of cases prices between us   and us   he added the presidents intervention occurs in the panel accompanied by the finance minister and the director of fedesarrollocanacol energy and ecopetrol led the increases today on the bvc on the other hand the list of shares with the highest increases was led by canacol energy with an appreciation of  closing at   per share this was followed by ecopetrol with a closing price of   after growing  the top three was completed by tecnoglass which gained  and ended the day at   meanwhile conconcretos stock was among the securities that registered the strongest falls of the day had a  decline and was traded at   it is followed by odinsa which presented a negative variation of  at an exit value of   and the preferential of cementos argos which lost  and closed at   today   million were traded in  operations with ecopetrols share being the most traded with  millionecopetrols demand from cbi could reach us   million faced with the statements that have been made from different tribunes and in which even the members of the board of directors participated who today claim that the responsibility lies with the rearview mirror the former president defended himself gutierrez pemberthys premise on the other hand is that the decisions taken since october  when glencore buys  of the refinerys stake was and has been collegiate it took two hours for the former president of ecopetrol to explain the labyrinth in which the state company was for nearly a decade and in which decisions were never  certain in his presentation he raised the four pillars and key moments in this process the first point was glencores involvement gutierrez stated that to the best of my knowledge this was carried out with all transparency processes and based on studies that estimated losses in present value with the old refinery in the order of us   million following glencores purchase of reficar the refinerys board of directors approves in november  the contracting of cbi for engineering purchasing and construction the situation changes in  we see that with the economic crisis triggered by the fall of lehman brothers glencore made it clear that this difficult situation prevents it from continuing with the project with this panorama the national government had two options going out to find another investor which led to the suspension of the project without concrete plans to restart it and not having the certainty of finding another investor he said former president gutierrez noted that the other scenario was the repurchase of reficar by ecopetrol it was necessary to ensure the capacity to decide on the execution and in may  in a decision of the government and ecopetrol and after assessing the suitability  of glencore is acquired to guarantee that this project is executed and the nuts according to javier gutierrez were tightened although cost overruns also increased so much so that in june  the magnifying glass and pressure put on the contractor allowed us to identify a deterioration in the management of the project it is at this point where the engineer who was in charge of the colombian oil company between  and  points out that the collection of evidence for the demand that in march  ecopetrol finally presented in the united states began although the lawsuit presented contemplates an amount of us   million the information that the former president of ecopetrol has collected would double the claims since it amounts to us   million and that amount is disaggregated from the controls that from  the state oil company began to make the contractor to pressure the execution of the work every peso is justified there were up to five boards of directors at ecopetrol to review construction progress  in identifying cost overruns gutierrez points out that for larger amounts inputs that were not budgeted in the basic engineering of the project and that were included later they reach us   million another item that it takes into account was the lower productivity partly explained by the unemployment of workers that the refinery experienced and that ended up generating an extra cost of us   million to this are also added the us   million of the increase in prices and the us   million that are explained by the delays in the construction schedule which implied an extension in the contracts finally javier gutierrez insists that it is very easy to analyze reficar now and not when making decisions the three options ecopetrol had in reficar if the former president of ecopetrol constantly stopped at something it was in the three exits that were always accompanying the reficar contract one was the change of investor or the suspension of the work the second way make use of the turnkey figure which is nothing more than setting an amount to build what is achieved with that budget the third was to continue the reimbursable cost model with the contractor opinions javier gutierrez former president of ecopetrol i came to put my face and be at the disposal of the authorities all the decisions were collegiate to finish reficar  daniel escobar director of economic research global securities the best thing that can happen to ecopetrol is that the investigations advance and determine the cost overrun of the modernization of reficarecopetrol reduces the  investment plan and drops from us   billion to us   billion  is a year of transition for the business group during which transportation projects and the startup of the new cartagena refinery will be completed starting in  the company will dedicate a greater proportion of its investments to the exploration and production segments the state oil company said in a statement according to the company  of the resources will be invested in colombia and the remainder abroad the breakdown of the investment plan shows that in a scenario where the total is us   million the business areas will have the largest destination with us   million which are divided as follows in exploration the colombian oil company will disburse us   million while that the destination for the production of hydrocarbons amounts to us   million in transportation ecopetrol plans to invest us   million and in refining and petrochemicals the sum reaches us   million in the investment plan there is also an item of others that amounts to us   million the resources required for the investment plan will come from internal cash generation the divestment of nonstrategic assets and financing resources the financing needs for  remain in the range between us   million and us   million at a consolidated level adds the oil companyecopetrol adjusted its investments for this year to us   million specifically in  resources between us   million and us   million will be allocated with which it is projected to produce  barrels of oil per day the segment that will receive the most budget will be refining and petrochemicals us   million followed by production us   million transportation us   million and exploration us   million according to the oil company that indicated that  of the resources will be invested in colombia this will be a year of transition during which transportation projects and the startup of the new cartagena refinery will be completed starting in  the company will dedicate a greater proportion of its investments to the exploration and production segments the business group statedecopetrols cut would not affect the regions in the short term although the reduction in the investments of the oil company is significant since the investment budget fell  when compared to the one presented on december   us   billion compared to the one announced two days ago us   million  the scissors were felt in the production area which fell  from us   million to us   million on the other hand the refining item was the only one in the business area that presented an increase of  see graph given this situation it would be thought that the regions would be affected by said cut however the accounts of the national government were already taking for granted a significant reduction in oil revenues so there would not be a significant impact on royalties manuel fernando castro territorial deputy director of the national planning department dnp told lr that fewer resources are being anticipated but not only due to the readjustment of ecopetrol but in general due to the situation that has been occurring throughout the oil sector  the official explained that the regions in  and  do not fall in the level of resources because the government carried out compensatory measures that include the dissaving of the savings and stabilization fund and financial returns a meeting between the national government ecopetrol and the federation of departments discussed the effect that the new oil scenario will bring from that meeting it was concluded that although the reality for the oil sector is not favorable the dynamics of execution of the system allows for sufficient resources to maintain the investment rhythm the government is based on the balances that have accumulated since  and that to date total   trillion for approvals in  what is recognized affected more by the fall in crude oil and in general the macro scenario is that the general system of royalties could receive lower income in   billion compared to what was programmed in fact the government accounts between  and  of having an average annual income of   billion under that new photo the different municipalities and departments of the country must now move the bet made by the minister of finance mauricio cardenas is to soften the landing of royalties to this new reality it is worth remembering that between  and  the general system of royalties stopped receiving   billion which averages   billion annually so although the effect that has also served as a cushion exchange rate so that the impact is not greater the reality is that now there will be fewer available resources in fact in the  financial plan made by the ministry of finance the decrease in income from ecopetrol was insisted on in that document inflows of   billion were initially projected the update presented in december an income of   billion a decrease of  on the other hand the financial market welcomed the readjustment since the session opened on the colombian stock exchange the oil companys share was in positive territory and marking green the start was at a price of   and the close was   diego franco director of economic research at franco valores indicated that the fact that the company wants to take care of its cash and financing is a good sign for investors it was already assumed that the oil companies in the world were going to focus resources especially in production  production and trm the lifesavers the devaluation of the colombian peso against the dollar as a result of a decision to have a floating exchange rate has generated an offsetting effect against the fall in oil prices and therefore has mitigated the decrease in the resources that go to royalties however while the barrel of crude in international markets between  and  has fallen  the us currency has appreciated  the other relevant element is production since to the extent that it is close to one million barrels per day it will also cushion the price impact it should be remembered that production is around  barrels of oil per day opinions jose david lopez coordinator of economic analysis of valoralta after touching the historical lows the trend changed and the stock closed above the level of the first issue of  manuel fernando castro territorial deputy director of national planning the effect on the territorial entities will not be strong due to the compensations that the system provided as savingsecopetrol authorized the last capitalization to terminate bioenergy today eight years after the first crop and with new technology that generates  tons per hectare ecopetrol gives the definitive support to bioenergy with a last capitalization of about us   million so that in december of this year it begins to produce up to  liters of ethanol per day the project in total in dollars continues to cost us   million however according to mauricio ramirez corporate manager of the ecopetrol business group the exchange rate has been a determining factor so that costs remain at that amount in this currency although we recognize that there is an additional increase in pesos the devaluation has favored the absorption of these latter costs now despite the fact that this process has not been easy for the oil company which had no knowledge of crops and ended up meeting a contractor with whom it is facing today in an international arbitration court isolux to recover some of the the costs that were generated since it went from us   million to us   million the future of bioenergy within the portfolio of the oil company remains uncertain according to the president of the state juan carlos echeverry in  when the project is finished and is much more attractive it will be defined whether or not the company continues with a  stake this since today it is known that ecopetrol will focus solely on producing and searching for oil also it is essential that this year as explained by the legal vice president of ecopetrol fernan bejarano the result of the award of the arbitration court will be obtained in which it is expected that ecopetrol can recover part of the costs that would have been errors of the spanish isolux  in cost overruns there is a percentage that is derived from the scope of the plant but another that is a consequence of the delays that were had before  when the spanish came out they had more than   million contracted explained ramirez thus it is estimated that of the total costs of the project there are more than us   million associated with financial expenses about us   associated with the longer time that this type of construction normally takes and the remaining difference is typical of the execution and other aspects on the other hand the president of bioenergy rafael pittaluga also clarified that it is expected to finish paying the debt that the company has of   million in  years which is the term of the loans however he clarified that the agricultural debt will be paid off in  all with resources from the operation itself lr also learned that at the time the liabilities that they had with the suppliers of the place were already healed and only those who have not yet presented support would be missing finally and among the achievements of this project which makes one of the most attractive areas for the agricultural world productive are the costs that the sugarcane operation will have and which are more competitive than other areas of the country we currently have a cost between cutting lifting and transporting the cane of   for each ton of cane while in the valley it costs   the other is the cost of the land in the modality that we have which is renting to farmers we give them   for each hectare during the year while in the valley that same hectare is at   million explained garcia thus the company is expected to generate sales of   million in the first year now despite these good figures the delay and cost overruns will only allow marginal returns that would improve once it goes into operation opinions mauricio ramirez corporate manager of the business group since  progress has begun but to a lesser extent from there a course that led us to change the contractor in   fernando garcia bioenergy agricultural operations manager in  technology was brought from brazil since the area was similar to that of the loft this was adapted since we have a planting system with level curves  learning to be the new ecopetrol has cost us ecopetrol was not successful in selecting the projects or the people this was admitted by juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol in an interview with lr in which he assured that the learning process to be a new company has cost them a lot echeverry added that they now face a new budget culture and the difficulty of not being able to use the few resources in their strategic priorities how are hiring processes improving it is an underlying theme we realized that the phrase is capital discipline we come from a period where we had more money than ideas and now we have more ideas than money this was a  barreladay company in which the others explored they gave us the successes of the exploration we paid half the costs and we shared the production since  ecopetrol was not a good explorer we did one field a year this is a difficult business very high risk for very high return what happened to us at ecopetrol that learning to be the new ecopetrol has cost us a lot so how good was ecopetrol at choosing projects and selecting who executes them we werent very good at choosing the projects and characters this being the case capital discipline is to adopt a system that is invented which any consultant will tell you about which is a system of locks quite demanding what have they changed the culture of the budget before you were assigned money and you executed it and if you are good or bad it depended on its execution as in the ministries but this is not a ministry it is a company and here you produce the money and if you dont produce it you dont have it we have removed the budget logic from ecopetrol and put a competitive logic on it money is scarce and you have to fight it with good projects what has been the impact of the delays on finances very easy this year we are finishing reficar and bioenergy a difficult year like this with the box so tight we should be dedicated to drilling wells and we are still finishing projects so how much has it cost us especially in this year it has cost us a lot in terms of priorities we still have two projects to finish when our strategic priority is exploration and production this led us to make  a year of transition when we should be executing the new strategy where us   billion is released to reach exploration and production so the cost is not being able to use the very scarce resources in our strategic priorities how does bioenergy enter into the long term of ecopetrol if in  it was seen that it was strategically very important to do bioenergy our future priority is exploration and production of oil and gas in that sense we have to think about what will happen to bioenergy although it is a decision that we have been postponing until we finish because now they do not value it so much we have received several proposals but we believe that when it is finished and working it will be worth more than it is worth today it is not necessarily part of our portfolio but  is the year of our decision the project is  complete of the  hectares that are expected to be planted  are already ready of these about  are bioenergys own the rest are the result of a business with riopaila in which the oil company provides the land and they perform the sowing thus there is an  progress and what is coming now is to finish the project with the same rhythm for which the manager of the company rafael pittaluga pointed out that a personnel motivation specialist was hired to maintain the work rhythm errors in bioenergy and reficar forced ecopetrol to change its contract in the past because we had the resources we were lax but the crisis has led us to put systems of locks that are much more demanding in which there is a culture of challenge he explained and this in part will be what echeverry will have to defend today in the plenary session of congress and tomorrow in a political control debate where senators await various answers for the cost overruns of more than us   million from reficar and us   million from bioenergy  this new model would attack the lack of competitiveness that existed within the company itself which in the words of the executive officer functioned as a ministry and not as a company only executing budget the form of contracting will be supported by the structural arm of the recently created vice presidency of engineering and projects this will also appoint an official with  or  years of experience who has handled projects of billions of dollars and who does not have large investments said echeverry the oil company will choose the name in the coming days but it already has several candidates in the deck who have worked on megaprojects around the world this being the case and despite the fact that the company expresses that cost overruns are unfortunately more common than is believed in the industry what you want is a person to whom this does not happen systematically we want people who finish the projects on time and with the assigned budget or with small deviations  the first thing then that the projects must present is the basic engineering then an extended engineering after the project is approved a detailed requirement in the execution and delivery in the early stages bad projects would leak out he explained now within the restructuring the purchases of the company will also be touched which annually reach   billion and which were carried out by third parties hired by the oil company what will be sought will be to have on the payroll people who know how to do large projects and contracts that is in the purchasing and supply system ecopetrol used to buy from third parties we had  people buying for ecopetrol at this time of those  there are about  and the idea is that in december we buy ourselves added echeverry who explained that this reduces the risk since there is a person in charge who is not diluted among so many days  in todays debate the possible sale of bioenergy will also be questioned as the president of ecopetrol explained to lr since according to the senator of the democratic center ivan duque with these cost overruns we must look at the expected profitability of the project compared to the original  in addition the comptroller said that there are problems in the provision of information by reficar and cbi in development of the special action that is being carried out state oil company agrees to two pacts with parex within the strategy of the oil company which seeks to partner with other operators to continue drilling with less risk ecopetrol signed two participation agreements farmouts with parex resources there it cedes  of the participation and operation in the de mares and playon blocks in the middle magdalena valley the idea is for the new partner to carry out the exploratory program and assume all the expenses of us   million opinions jose roberto acosta professor of cesa this new strategy is correct this should have been done a long time ago but it is the recognition of the error of the past administrations  ivan duque marquez senator of the democratic center with these cost overruns you have to look at the expected profitability compared to the original if they plan to sell it is interesting to know if that generates a profit or a loss this tuesday after the market closes ecopetrol will present financial results the market will be aware of these results after the company did not present a good  when it had a net loss of   billion that is a negative variation of   since in  it had had profits of   billion reason why the company decided not to pay dividends however the expectation is positive if one takes into account that the price of a barrel has reached its maximum and that the oil company has implemented plans to reduce costs in this way today investors will know the current financial status of the company ecopetrol entered into agreements with a multinational for oil exploration ecopetrol will reinforce the oil exploration activity with the signing of two participation agreements with the canadian parex resources inc according to ecopetrol this agreement gives it a  stake and operation in the blocks from mares and playon in the valle medio del magdalena basin these blocks are located to the east and north of the la cira infantas field under the two current exploration and exploitation agreements with the national hydrocarbons agency anh for these areas ecopetrol has been working actively in the last  years in the acquisition of geophysical information drilling of wells and evaluation programs indicated the company in addition parex committed to finance  of the work on the  well with an investment of an estimated cost of three million dollars in the de mares block for its part in the playon block parex will also assume all of the drilling costs for the  well which have been estimated at seven million dollars according to ecopetrol these two agreements are the result of the strategy that the company initiated in  to invite widely recognized oil companies to be partners in exploration activity these agreements make it possible to diversify risk reduce investment commitments and generate value for ecopetrols exploration portfolio linking more companies with extensive technical experience the agreements require approval by the national hydrocarbons agency as established in the de mares and playon exploration and exploitation agreementsdespite low production and lower prices ecopetrols earnings rose  this puts the oil company within the block of operating companies that made profits despite the fact that the price of crude oil fell to an average of us   during the first three months the lowest figure in  years which led ecopetrol to face a difficult situation for daniel escobar director of economic research at global securities the results were a good surprise since ecopetrol managed to compensate for this scenario of low prices with savings of   billion we must highlight the work that the company has been doing in managing its resources and in the savings it has programmed  for the market it is precisely this prioritization of the cash and the transformation program that has given good results since sales of   billion were achieved and an operating profit of   billion additionally for the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry the positive impact of the devaluation of the exchange rate on revenues and the recording of a lower net financial loss allowed the company to register that growth of  in the net profit attributable to shareholders and improve its ebitda margin compared to the first quarter of  as well as maintain stable its operating margins and its ebitda around   billion  now these savings in capex and in operation also had a negative side and was the decrease in crude production which reached  barrels equivalent per day compared to  that had been obtained in the first quarter of  and  of the last period of  however alejandro reyes ultraserfinco research director explained that these are very favorable figures if one takes into account the difficult context that arose in this first quarter the average price of crude oil did not exceed us   on average so these positive results give a signal of encouragement to the market in which the company with its cost reduction plans is assimilating well  the figure that analysts continue to punish is the low exploration that the oil company continues to have since during this quarter only the drilling of a delimiting well leon  in deep waters of the us gulf of mexico ended reficar the company highlighted that the refinery has already exported  million barrels of refined products during the first quarter of  achieving sales of   billion however due to its debt it still does not generate profits but losses of   million political control debate on the other hand and despite the fact that at the end of this edition the debate on political control for reficar had not yet ended echeverry responded by part of the controversies that were created such as senator jorge enrique robledos questioning that the the  delay has generated losses for the oil company of more than us   billion in this case echeverry pointed out that in the lawsuit cbi is also being charged in addition to cost overruns of us   billion for damages to the company the possibility that the demand will be lost due to the politicization that has taken place was left up in the air the senator of the democratic center ivan duque pointed out that this is hanging by a thread due to the politicization that is taking place by members of the board of directors of the oil company who have pointed out that the errors come from past governments according to duque these statements could end up favoring the us company for trying to get away politically from responsibilities in the country the executive vice president of reficar pointed out that one of the most valid firms in the world was hired in arbitration so it is expected with a high probability to be victorious opinions jorge enrique robledo senator of the polo democratico negligence is also a crime and ecopetrol knew what was happening in the minutes of the meetings of ecopetrol and reficar there is evidence of all the inconsistencies  ivan duque marquez senator of the democratic center the lawsuit against cbi can be lost because they have been in charge of politicizing the debate pointing out that the past government was to blameafter delivery of results ecopetrol rises  on the stock market it should be remembered that after the closing of the stock market yesterday in the bvc the state oil company delivered financial results in which it revealed that during the first quarter of the year it had a profit attributable to shareholders of   million that is it grew by  compared to same period of  camilo silva manager of valorainversiones

juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol  in addition the businessman indicated that during the first quarter brent reached an average price of us   per barrel and reached its lowest level in the

carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol the good results are proof of the solidity of the company and its ability to respond to the current situationecopetrol was the one that fell the most in the trading session on the side of the best performing stocks the first place went to paz del rio which rose  to   per share the second place went to odinsa whose price grew  and the podium of those who won the most in the day was closed by the preferential one from bancolombia which rose  regarding the stock indices the colcap presented a  decline and closed at  units the colir presented the same

negotiations on the stock exchange of colombia bvc finally within the established rules participants will not have a minimum number of shares that they can acquire in this process with this process the transaction would be completed which in the first instance left ecopetrol   million and in the second it would be expected to collect   million for a total of   billion that will be used to finance the investment plan of the oil company this year it varies in a range between us   and us   million analysts expect this operation to be completed successfully as eebs finances are solid and several growth projects are in mind that would provide stability to future income it is good to remember that the financing needs for this year for the ecopetrol business group are in the range between us   and us   million without taking into account the resources that can be obtained from this divestment plan to date resources for us   million have already been made through loans with local and international banks the cash flow of the oil company has also been leveraged by the results obtained in the auction of ecopetrols participation in isa held in april which allowed the award of shares for an amount of   million explained in the delivery of results the president of the company juan carlos echeverry analysts will be attentive to the results of this operation that could give an indication of how investors took the change of helmsman in the eeb it should be remembered that the government authorized the eeb to borrow or issue bonds abroad for us   milliongrupo aval surpassed ecopetrol among the largest companies according to the famous ranking which bases its score on a calculation derived from the income earnings assets and market value of the companies the financial conglomerate controlled by luis carlos sarmiento was placed in  place in the ranking  positions above of the state oil company  that also dropped  positions compared to  this year the list that is still led by chinese banks has  public companies from  countries that together represent us   billion in revenues us   trillion in profits and a total market value of us   billion according to forbes the market value of ecopetrol was us   million while last year the figure was us   million in addition this year its profits fell   billion ecopetrols losses are linked to the drop in the price of crude however the sales would have been profitable if the implementation of the niif standards had not been taken into account  indicated mauricio reina a researcher at fedesarrollo and the fact is that the collapse of the oil barrel tariff stopped the oil bonanza that colombia and the rest of the region experienced thus ecopetrols results which showed losses last year were one of the reasons why it fell so much in global  ecopetrols market capitalization fell almost  while grupo aval was less exposed to the market falls only  or   explained orlando santiago manager of fenix valor in total colombia contributed five companies to the world list it should be noted that all positions fell except sociedades bolivar which rose  positions from  to  despite occupying the first place among local

should be remembered that the canadian company must deliver rubiales to ecopetrol on june  in compliance with the reversion process provided for in the association contract and that has been planned since  the uten considers that the employer replacement of the current workers of pacific is the way foreseen in colombian law to guarantee your right regarding job continuity however it is willing to look for linkage alternatives that are more agile or effective as long as ecopetrol establishes mechanisms that guarantee current workers the real possibility of continuing to work in the field in which they have been doing in recent years  says the statement the directors of the uten recalled that they have been meeting with ecopetrol representatives since the end of last year in order to generate a dialogue table and joint work so that the activities of campo rubiales do not suffer essential variations after june   and thus give continuity to the workers who currently work there which is undoubtedly the best option for everyone they also recalled that the then minister of labor luis eduardo garzon highlighted that workers are an extremely important asset for any company and urged ecopetrol to take into account those who are currently at pacific and work with them finally the union group reported that it has taken steps with the ministry now headed by clara lopez and with the

equivalent to  of the subscribed and paid shares when the sale of the stake becomes effective the resources that would be generated will be used to finance the investment plan of the company with exploitation and production businesses according to ecopetrol the announcement had been made at the beginning of this year more precisely at the end of january when ecopetrol announced that as part of its investment plan in noncore assets the board of directors approved to start the disposal process finally it is worth noting that this year ecopetrol has an investment plan that ranges between usd   million and usd   million without counting the resources generated by propilcogrupo exito aval and ecopetrol are the titles most desired by foreigners according to figures from the broker casa de bolsa the title that has received the highest net investment this year is grupo exito with   million followed by the preferred share of grupo aval with   million ecopetrol with   million the ordinary of grupo sura with   million the preferential title of the same group with   million and the ordinary of bancolombia with negotiations for   million in order to be able to mount and liquidate positions quickly the names in which they invest are not necessarily those in which they judge that there are better prospects but rather those with greater liquidity that is those that are more representative in colcap said carlos anaya equity strategist at casa de bolsa for its part the largest purchases registered in may were by cementos argos with   million grupo sura with   million exito with   million and grupo nutresa with   million andres felipe sanchez variable income analyst at ultraserfinco added without a doubt the rise and greater strengthening of interest rates by the issuer generates not only a greater devaluation of the exchange rate but also a greater purchasing power on the part of foreigners over our market and that would eventually develop a greater interest in our shares  and it is that this panorama is not surprising since last year foreigners took the gold medal in net purchases and during the  consecutive months they accumulated transactions for   billion being grupo argos exito and grupo nutresa the titles of the bvc most bought by this group only in december however the pension funds continue to have the lead in terms of net purchases of shares until so far this year since until may they have registered negotiations for   trillion the negotiations of the afps in terms of securities have been mostly concentrated in units of the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange colcap which has in turn contributed to the appreciation registered in the first four months of the year that is close to  explained omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores regarding the near future of the largest net buyers of shares on the national stock market analysts consulted by lr agree that pension funds would continue to lead over foreigners the pension funds should remain in the first place of net buyers since foreigners although they behaved as buyers throughout  this year they have only been for two months and in specific issuers in which they see a good position added sanchez bbva fell  in the bvc session during yesterdays session on the colombian stock exchange bvc bbvas preferred stock fell  and its share traded   enka de colombia

the largest net buyers so far this year are the pension funds which have also largely driven the strong appreciation of colcap andres felipe sanchez variable income analyst at ultraserfinco the rise in interest rates generates a greater devaluation of the exchange rate and this will develop a greater interest in our shares from foreigners roberto steiner resigned from the board of directors of ecopetrol steiner was the representative of the minority shareholders on the board of directors of ecopetrol it should be remembered that at the last general meeting the small shareholders expressed their dissatisfaction because they considered that steiner did not represent their interests for which they asked that he retire or that an additional member be appointed within his professional career he has held various positions such as the government representative on the policy oversight committee in the coffee sector or a member of the board of directors of the bogota stock exchange among othersecopetrol reactivated drilling and with  wells it expects to meet production target development wells are those that the operating companies carry out in a field that is already producing in order to extract more hydrocarbon from the subsoil by drilling a greater number of holes this year this work in the industry is practically paralyzed  wells in total which is why production has fallen to an average of  barrels a day in the best years of the state company when oil exceeded us   and the goal was to reach a million barrels the idea was to drill  development wells however with the fall in prices in october of the previous year the goal was lowered to  for which  drills were required today the plan is to drill only  holes using five drills in the remainder of the year if prices remain around us   per barrel now as explained by rafael guzman the companys technical vice president of production the new drills contracted four to nabors and one to independence have a key element that is part of the strategy and that is that they are more efficient and drill in half the time than those normally used in the country which speeds up the mobilization of equipment and operating costs and the importance of this decrease in time and costs of this equipment is that the drilling activity represents between  and  of the total cost of the development projects of a field  in this way and since the restart of the campaign that took place in may in the castilla and chichimene fields ecopetrol expects to maintain the production goal of  average barrels per day a figure that was presented to the market in the second month of the year but according to analysts it is quite conservative which is why surprises are expected from the oil company now as guzman explained the new strategy will not be limited to castilla and chichimene but will be extended to the rest of the fields in the country including rubiales whose operation will be assumed by the state company on july  in fact as explained by the oil company the idea is that this last field does not follow the decline that it has shown in recent months of about  and on the contrary with the drilling campaign it remains at  average barrels per day it was also clarified that this field will be operated  by ecopetrol which has already hired  of the personnel that will work at the site the company recalled that the change of drills began to be sought since  since the new technology achieved that the cost of drilling went from us   million to us   million and the average times from  days to  in this way only in the rental of the rig was the cost cut in half  concluded guzman gibraltar workers ask the government for help in addition to the fact that there are already some workers who have not been able to leave the facilities of the gibraltar plant for more than  days since the uwa indigenous people do not allow the exit or entry of personnel to the place added that one of the pipes that supply water to the place suffered damage still unknown and does not allow the plant to have the service thus the workers sent a letter to the government to listen to the community and reach an agreement that allows them to leave the place in turn the company could solve the damage to the gas pipeline that does not allow the delivery of  million cubic feet in the area opinions rafael guzman technical vice president of ecopetrol production if crude oil prices remain at levels close to or above us   a barrel ecopetrol plans to increase drilling as of  ruben dario lizarralde president of campetrol urgent measures are required from the government that seek to reactivate drilling in the country in order to increase productionecopetrol offered  exploration assets in five areas of the country this bet was called ronda campos  and it is part of the  strategy that aims to support the creation of sustainable value and rotate the portfolio in search of greater profitability for shareholders felipe bayon pardo vice president of ecopetrol said that the  assets have  investment opportunities for companies that wanted to continue investing in the country or that want to start investing in the country we are focused on very important assets in which we are going to continue investing this allows them to bring additional resources and that these amounts can be used in other assets said bayon as the vice president of the company mentioned in the five zones that were mentioned above  points will operate the region that will have the most points is the middle magdalena valley with five which will be located in lebrija and barrancabermeja cristalina and pavas cachira garzas sogamoso and la rompida the remaining four zones each have three points alejandro martinez cofounder of amv consultores said that this type of news is very good because it increases the interest of national and foreign investors to operate in colombia furthermore they bet on the development of each of the regions where the points defined by ecopetrol will be located  the idea with the award is that some rights in the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in the area be transferred ownership of assets wells and facilities listed in the virtual data room information and current contracts licenses and permits on the other hand the adjudication schedule will be marked by different dates that must be met during the second semester the first commitment will be the following june  when the terms of reference will be announced it will also be the beginning of the prequalification of the bidders to keep the wells a process that would run until the end of august on the other hand on september  and  the publication of the list of prequalified and the delivery of the proposals and award will be made finally between october  and  assignment contracts will be signed regarding the doubts that there are about the workers who are currently in the  points vice president bayon assured that our workers are the greatest asset we have in the company in this sense the people who are working on those  investment opportunities will continue working with ecopetrol we have some very important projects and programs throughout the country which we are going to focus on from  onwards and we need these people to accompany us rubiales will represent  of ecopetrols production since ecopetrols current weighted participation in the two contracts is  and meta petroleum  since july  the state oil company has earned  barrels per day that is  of the companys current production it is for this reason that the ceremony will be held with all the formal acts at  pm and will be attended by the minister of mines and energy german arce and the governor of meta marcela amaya furthermore as explained by the company with the receipt of this field ecopetrol will consolidate itself as the largest heavy crude operator since it would add the three largest in the country castilla chichimene and rubiales which represent about  barrels per day that is a third of the production in colombia  now despite the fact that the keys to the field will be handed over tomorrow the company has been making the connection for nearly two years which has already completed  of the contract once the state petroleum company assumes the operation among the main challenges the new team in charge of the operation of the asset has the optimization of operating costs of energy subsoil and surface as well as the implementation of improvements to the treatment process of fluids to achieve greater efficiency in field operation  there is also the challenge of reducing development well drilling days by  explained hector manosalva the oil companys vice president of productionsp global ratings confirms ecopetrols bbb rating and maintains a negative outlook in a statement they announced that ecopetrols indicators will remain weak during  as a result of a significant reduction in capital spending and a moderate drop in production in  however sp global ratings acknowledges that the company has achieved greater operating efficiencies than forecasted due to its austerity plan we continue to assess the probability of extraordinary sufficient and timely government support as very high in the event that the company faces financial difficulties the document outlinesecopetrol and grupo argos support the protection of animals the total investment of the project is   million among which are   million contributed by ecopetrol and   million from wcs and the executors it works with  species seven of fauna and three of flora in the magdalena medio and llanos orientales regions which have concrete conservation actions developed between  and  by  recognized entities of the national order  said carlos saavedra general manager of the vida silvestre program the animals within the project are the bluebilled curassow the marimonda or spider monkey the manatee the striped catfish the tapir the llanero caiman and the charapa turtle the selection of the species which are found in different degrees of vulnerability was carried out taking into account the information of the country previous studies and was validated with experts from the alexander von humboldt institute the ministry of the environment and the natural national parks unit from colombia added saavedra for juan carlos franco director of the mario santo domingo foundation the great goal is to promote the consolidation of vehicles for the collective impact of public and private conservation organizations that they can commit knowledge and capacities human and financial resources to strengthen the conservation of species and biodiversity  this organization has invested in the last four years   million in adaptation for climate change conservation of the ecosystem and protection of species in addition to contributing to the vida silvestre project they also work in the conservation of the spectacled bear primates and magdalena tortoises and amphibians grupo argos and the spectacled bear conservamos vida is a publicprivate partnership between the fundacion del grupo argos national parks of colombia and the wildlife conservation society that seeks to protect the spectacled bear the project which started in  has an investment of   billion and the smurfit kappa colombia foundation and the mario santo domingo foundation have also joined we are creating an ecological corridor for the spectacled bear to move around being such a large mammal it needs a large area to reproduce it is an umbrella species which means that if we protect it it also affects the conservation of other species said the grupo argos foundation adding that one of the main threats to this animal is illegal trafficking and even the customs of the inhabitants of the areas rural consuming spectacled bear paw if these projects do not go hand in hand with the private sector it is very difficult for them to be sustainable over time because a project is not only to make a diagnosis and a management plan but to implement and monitor it added the grupo argos foundation  hernando garcia deputy director of research at the alexander von humboldt institute he explained that there are initiatives at a global level that we have not achieved in colombia such as that of save your logo many companies worldwide have a kind of animal as their logo to promote conservation actions for species such as lacoste with the crocodile the jaguar car brand with the jaguar or the few colombian cases such as ecopetrol with the iguana or gas natural with the butterfly the institute worked with the colombian air force to change the logo that had a bald eagle which is more representative of the united states for the harpy eagle which is a highly threatened species in colombia and is the most representative bird in the country along with the condor  garcia recalled that walt disney financially supports the conservation of the whiteheaded tamarin in colombia even in the animal kingdom park in orlando united states there is a space dedicated to this animal so it generates an immediate connection with the childrens audience jaguar a vulnerable national species last may photos uploaded to social networks of a dead jaguar caused outrage and controversy among users the ministry of the environment sent a letter to the attorney generals office to inform them of the fact and make a call to protect this unique species in south america which lives in the colombian jungles although it reproduces well in captive conditions it is included in the vulnerable category colombia included the largest feline in america in  in the list of threatened wild species found in the national territory opinions juan

saavedra general manager wildlife project we work with  species seven of fauna and three of flora in the magdalena medio and in the eastern plains between  and  hernando garcia deputy director of research at the humboldt institute private companies should be part of the solution and should not be identified as part of the problem of biodiversity lossecopetrol begins to extract  of the national crude with cusiana and rubiales however today with the reversal of rubiales and cusiana which occurred on july  and  ecopetrol manages to operate and directly extract an average of  barrels of the  that are being generated on average this plus  of barrels of crude that equion had in the tauramena contract and  that pacific had in rubiales and piriri which make up  barrels of crude makes the stateowned company produce  of the oil in colombia now it is necessary to clarify that the percentage would increase much more if the gas produced by cusiana was taken into account in equivalent barrels  barrels of oil equivalent however the anh makes the distinction between the two hydrocarbons so that in oil from this field only  barrels would be added which is  of the production that is in the agencys records for april figures from ecopetrol as of may show that it could reach  bdp faced with the issue and despite the celebrations that took place for the return of these fields to the hands of the state company francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association  acp pointed out that the contribution of pacific and bp cannot be forgotten not only in economic terms but also in the transfer of knowledge that allowed rubiales and cusiana to become two of the most important oil complexes in colombia likewise one cannot forget the commitment to colombia made by these companies which saw the country as an attractive setting to invest their resources and contribute to national and regional development  thus lloreda explained that it is necessary to evaluate this model of association contracts and look for new mechanisms that promote new projects and promote the oil sector in the country ecopetrol contracts ecopetrol has  association contracts that expire between  and  and despite the fact that many are small fields the reversal of these which is still being analyzed would lead the oil company to add at least  barrels ie  of current production regarding the issue hector manosalva ecopetrols vice president of production explained that they are seeking to diversify the contracting model so that this type of contract continues to be an investment instrument but not the only one there must be diversity to be able to carry out risk and development investments he told the acp at the rubiales ceremony juan carlos echeverry president of the company explained that the only thing that this strategy seeks is to turn ecopetrol into an efficient and effective company ecopetrol will supply liquefied petroleum gas from termoyopal the ministry of mines asked the superintendency of services to clarify the facts of termoyopals exit on may  since the lack of liquefied petroleum gas production worries several users who receive the supply from this company according to german arce the company has not explained whether the events originated from actions or omissions that are subjects of investigation for its part ecopetrol incorporated an additional offer of  barrels that would cover the deficit caused by the contingency opinions francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association colombia must evaluate how to enhance the model that maintains many contracts in force and seek mechanisms that promote the sector hector manosalva vice president of production of ecopetrol in rubiales of every  barrels produced  will be royalties and ecopetrol will receive  this is an increase of  in terms of gross income for the firmecopetrol share fell  on the day according to the experts consulted by lr this was mainly due to the sharp drop in the international price since according to the bloomberg platform at  pm the wti fell  and the brent   in second place was the title of grupo exito which presented a decrease of  to   the top three was closed by conconcreto after registering a drop of  and a closing of   per share on the other hand canacol was the stock that achieved the most important

this regard with   million a share that registered a negative behavior in its price from  to   cemargos was in third place with   million a title that also had a negative behavior in its price with a drop of  to   regarding the capitalization index of the colombian stock market the colcap closed on tuesday at  units with a decrease of  compared to the previous day according to the bvc so far this year the stock market indicator has registered a positive variation of  as for the colsc liquidity index it registered a positive variation of  to  units finally the colir registered a fall of  to  units and coleqty also fell  to  units on international markets according to the head of economic research at profesionales de bolsa felipe pinzon north american investors pushed the treasurys yield to its lowest since  as weak data in china increased concerns about the impact of the vote of the british on their exit from the european union  he added that trading in one of britains largest real estate funds was suspended in a sign of financial tension following the countrys vote to leave the european unionbancolombia and ecopetrol the ones with the most temporary transfers of securities currently the shares that carry out the largest transactions through this type of operation are bancolombia with   million ecopetrol with   million grupo sura with   million grupo argos with   million and avianca with   million likewise according to figures from the colombian stock exchange bvc these operations have shown growth in recent years going from trading   million in its year of creation  to   million in  with november being the month with the highest trading volume with   million this lease of titles can be made at any time since it does not have any operating conditions and is made in the form of a loan between two parties originator and recipient the figure allows the investor to bet on an asset when he believes that it will lose value in the future for example the investor can sell some shares that he borrowed and buy them back cheaper after they lose value to later return them to their owner and earn the difference concluded alejandro isaza an analyst at ultraserfinco the originators can be mutual funds pension funds a highcapital investor who has a longterm investment portfolio or a passive person who does not move his shares much and wants to get more out of his portfolio these are in charge of placing your titles for someone else to take them for a certain time one of the great advantages is the accessibility for all types of agents since anyone can carry out the operation without any type of minimum amount and regardless of the capital they have said omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores however for daniel escobar director of economic research at global securities this activity is not very frequent at this time since for this type of operations people with high capitals and longterm objectives are sought and they are not ordinary people in the market stock market  this type of lease must have a performance guarantee which is established according to the liquidity of the shares that are being transferred for example if an originator delivers bancolombia securities these will have a guarantee of  and if the amount of shares loaned is   million then the recipient will have to guarantee the other person in public debt securities cash or some shares for   million in this way ttvs become an alternative to increase the profitability of a portfolio of shares since the investor receives an additional  return compared to the rates offered by cdts or collective investment funds terpel fell  in the bvc terpel with a negative variation of  to   was the most affected species in the colombian stock exchange there was also depreciation in bvc with a negative variation of  and cemex with a depreciation of  the species with the highest trading volume was davivienda preferential with   million while grupo argos achieved the most important rise during the session growing  opinion omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores one of the great advantages of this figure is accessibility since anyone can carry out this type of operationecopetrol bancolombia and sura are the shares that move the most money in the bvc in the top five of the most traded titles within the national stock market this year isagen also appears with   million cementos argos with   million grupo exito with   million and icolcap with   million david villan equity analyst at adcap explained that there are several reasons for this phenomenon first they are the best weighted shares in colcap so they will always be the most traded second they are the ones with the highest volume so an investor can enter and exit easily and third they are the issuers of solid companies with significant equity support higher income and growth levels and better growth prospects in the short and medium term however for diego franco director of economic studies at franco valores it is absurd that the markets focus on these securities and especially on sura and cementos argos since they are named titles but they do not generate sustained value for shareholders  in the specific case of sura these volumes were a response to the process of transferring shares of the royal  sun alliance seguros company thus completing the process of acquiring rsas operations in latin america and comprising businesses in chile  argentina mexico brazil colombia and uruguay  added franco faced with the reasons why these stocks are always at the top and what should be done to make these first boxes more mobile natalia casas an ultraserfinco equity analyst explained that there is a vicious circle in the face of colombian regulation of funds of pensions since they are measured by minimum profitability so there are no incentives to move the portfolio since these continue to generate costs likewise the trust of natural persons has not recovered after interbolsa so you have to reach the ordinary person so that they not only invest in the real estate sector but in stocks since it is a market that also it generates many returns casas added the analysts consulted coincide in assuring that titles such as conconcreto cemex el condor isa and celsia are species that are financially well but are hardly traded since they participate in a market that does not see them for example cemex and celsia have better prospects thanks to the positive moment that the construction and energy sector is experiencing in the country so their income and profit levels tend to recover added villan for its part isa should negotiate much more because its business in energy and real estate both here and abroad is being favored by the current situation concluded casas an option to reduce financial costs as well as a profitability option temporary securities transfers are also an option to reduce financial costs for example when using this figure you get  below the average cost of free investment loans and payroll loans thus the average of the free investment loan rates is  while the payroll rate is  if the percentages of the ttv are compared it is  similarly returns are higher than other instruments at  days for example cdts deliver  collective investment funds  while this figure delivers returns of  opinions diego franco director of economic studies at franco valores it is absurd that the market focuses especially on sura and cementos argos since they are name titles but they do not generate sustained value for shareholders natalia casas ultraserfinco equity analyst you have to gain the confidence of ordinary people so that they not only invest in the real estate sector but also in stocks which is a market that generates profitabilityecopetrol bancolombia and sura the largest purchases by the commission agents in this way the scbs accumulated net purchases in the sixth month of the year for   million  more than what they negotiated in january  when the figure amounted to   million in june the largest acquisitions of these companies were bancolombia with   million ecopetrol with   million grupo sura with   million nutresa with   million and grupo exito with   million however according to figures from the colombian stock exchange bvc for the current year the commission companies are the first net buyers with   billion and behind are the pension and severance funds with   billion and foreigners who have made acquisitions for   billion if you look at the scb purchases you realize that they were peppered by the entire index the idea that this generates is that this month they essentially invested in the individual names that make up the index basket in order to create etf units and then sell them to pension funds explained carlos anaya equity analyst at casa de bag precisely this point is ratified by the june market flow report of this commission agent which ensures that since the scbs are the etf structurers the main sales are reflected in icolcap with   million in june and of   million during the year however thanks to the purchases made in species such as exito bancolombia and grupo sura these participants were located as net buyers in the month the report says for his part alejandro isaza ultraserfinco fixed income analyst pointed out that this month was particularly different for two specific reasons the first was the sale of the bogota energy company eeb by ecopetrol and that it was bought mostly due to pension funds and the second was that the commission companies had almost no divestments in any company they only sold icolcap but in general they remained as net buyers  regarding the behavior that the list of largest net buyers will maintain for the remainder of this year anaya indicated that this same dynamic has remained in july since foreigners tend to be away from the market when summer begins in the united states and they recover in september so it would be normal for foreigners and pension funds to keep their original places it is expected that the rest of the year everything will remain the same although before may the most aggressive purchases of the afps were presented because they were rebuilding their portfolio after the sale of isagen the following months will continue with the purchase of specific names such as davivienda  concluded anaya bbva

the companys outlook from stable to negative in line with the update of the perspective of the republic of colombia the statement saidecopetrol maintains its investment grade for fitch given the companys strategic link with the sovereign the agency reduced the companys outlook from stable to negative in line with the update of the outlook for the republic of colombia bbb negative outlook published on july  it said in the statement it should be remembered that last friday fitch revised the outlook of colombias bbb rating from stable to negative mainly as a result of the deterioration in fiscal accounts higher indebtedness and external imbalances furthermore ecopetrol reported that as a result of the review of the methodology that the risk rating agency applied to all the countries it covers the international rating in local currency of ecopetrol sa was equal to that of foreign currency leaving both at bbb sp last february had also revised the outlook for colombia leaving it negativesavings of   million would save ecopetrols second quarter according to the analysis of valores bancolombia what is expected in terms of production is that the company will have closed with  boed that is  less than in the same period of  this reduction would occur especially due to the natural decrease in results lower investments in exploration and production and the closure of the cano sur and akacias fields  they explain however despite the fact that this would generate a drop in revenues analysts expect it to be partially amortized by the improvements that the price of a barrel of crude had between april and june when it went above us   on average during the first quarter at an average of us   in the second now the mitigation of the price would not be a high percentage  since in the same period the exchange rate fell  the experts explained thus what we expect is that both the gross income and the net income of the company will fall on average  during the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of the previous year where sales of   billion were obtained  while on the ebitda side we expect an advance of at least   explained felipe pinzon head of research at profesionales de bolsa however and despite the fact that ecopetrol will join the group of oil companies that deliver positive results one of the great concerns of the market is that production is not growing but that it is stagnant if it does not increase its technology in recovery and does not have findings ecopetrols results will be very misaligned compared to the end of  explained diego franco director of economic studies at franco valores who added that the question that is expected to be answered is if the company will have the capacity to be more efficient since the margin for maneuver is running out and it is having acceptable results which are derived from savings and divestments and not from an improvement in management in fact for analysts the salvation will be in the savings of   million for the semester which ecopetrol explained to lr that it has achieved to date of which   were made between april and june with this outlook market expectations of profit are between   billion and   billion all depending on the real impact that reficar will have which is already working at  finally analysts recall that higher cash flows from the sale of isa and eeb shares will help for the rest of the year which should allow improvements in the exploration and production program new austerity for the company despite the fact that the oil companies were already carrying out accounts with a price of us   per barrel the global securities team explained that the strong volatility generates uncertainty about the future so more stable levels are still expected to invest in exploration and production  in fact at ecopetrol they are quartered looking for ways to reinforce austerity measures we have to keep our belts tight and take care of every weight said juan carlos echeverry president of the firm to his executives when reviewing plans to further reduce costs in the remainder of  opinion omar suarez analyst of alianza valores it helps a lot that ecopetrol is not only in production but also in transportation which was the main protagonist of the first quartercanacol and ecopetrol were the best in the bvc thus canacols securities presented an advance of  and negotiations will begin today at   in addition on its twitter account bancolombia bancolombia_inv indicated that it continues to maintain the speculative purchase recommendation of the

company gunflints production reached  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped of which  is owned by ecopetrol meanwhile the coowners of this well in the gulf of mexico noble energy keeps  samson offshore mapleleaf with  and marathon oil corporation with  the production area has additional development potential and is located  kilometers from new orleans on the louisiana coast in the extended mississippi river canyon the well had a depth greater than  kilometers with a  kilometer water column the company said in a statement with the contribution of gunflint the average production of the ecopetrol subsidiary in the united states increases from  barrels to more than  ecopetrol is pleased with the success of gunflint which allows the company to almost triple its production in the gulf of mexico a promising area in its exploration and production strategy for the coming years said juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol  the gunflint discovery was recorded in  by british petroleum bp in march  ecopetrol america inc acquired the stake that bp had and in the last two years it participated in drilling works subsea completion and installation of facilities for the development of the fieldecopetrol began production of  barrels per day in the us this field thus becomes the companys largest producer in the united states followed by  and dalmatian with which it completes  barrels of oil equivalent per day bped gunflints production which already reaches  boed is shared by ecopetrol with noble energy inc which is the operator and has  samson offshore mapleleaf llc which has  and marathon oil corporation with  the gunflint discovery was registered in  by bp in march  ecopetrol america inc acquired the stake that bp had and in the last two years it participated in the drilling works subsea completion and installation of facilities for the development of the field the company explained in a statement ecopetrol is pleased with the success of gunflint which allows the company to almost triple its production in the gulf of mexico usa a promising area in its exploration and production strategy for the next few years said juan carlos echeverry president of the company now for experts it is paradoxical that in this field which has a high level of complexity since it is in deep waters at  meters from the seabed it is already taking place while in the onshore in colombia the activity in the meta it is becoming almost impossible to do because of social conflicts additionally the oil company reported that it continues to execute its strategy in the gulf with the drilling this year of the leon  wells with repsol and warrior with anadarko thus it seeks to strengthen exploration in the area in conjunction with the partnership formula to face low oil prices finally ecopetrol highlighted that the advances in the gulf of mexico are very important if one takes into account that ecopetrols production in the united states already exceeds that of the company in the putumayo area which today amounts to about  barrels per day ecopetrol reported   trillion of net profit in the first half of  according to the statement the oil company had a net profit of   billion  higher than in the first quarter of  regarding the semester ecopetrol registered net profit accumulated of   trillion this result was due to the  recovery in the price of brent crude the reduction of our operating expenses and the structural savings efforts our ebitda margin remains solid around  said juan carlos echeverri president of ecopetrol in a statement published by the financial superintendence according to echeverry the savings goal in  is   trillion pesos regarding the rubiales and cusiana fields ecopetrol announced that it currently operates with more than  thousand barrels per daycenits   billion profit boosted ecopetrols results this figure was  higher than that of the same period in  when the companys earnings were   million if you look at the consolidated statements in just the second quarter of the year the firms profit was   million  less than the second quarter of  when the net profit of the oil company was   billion  omar suarez economic analyst at alianza valores explained that the transportation segment among the three that the company has continues to be the most important in the current situation since it does not depend on the behavior of international oil prices if you look at cenit it had a utility that weighs a lot and is still a very important weight while if one looks at reficars behavior this segment presented a loss of   million and the ebitda was    million despite being in operation  said suarez cost and expense reduction market analysts consider that the cost and expense reduction policy has been good and has been carried out judiciously however in this quarter it was observed that costs and expenses were reduced by a smaller proportion than income it is clear that costs and expenses can be reduced to be efficient but that has a limit because it cannot be done indefinitely the ebitda margin was  going from  which is not bad due to the crisis that is happening said suarez according to the opinion of diego franco head of economic research at franco valores the good performance of ecopetrols financial statements at the end of the first half of  is due to the good management that the company president juan has been carrying out carlos echeverry in cutting expenses and adds that the repowering in the production of the wells that were already in place has been key to overcoming the adverse outlook according to echeverry in a statement in the second quarter of  the company reported savings of   million for an accumulated in the first half of   million the savings goal in  is   trillion  ecopetrols share closed yesterday with a rise of  to   the challenge for the future is exploration although analysts highlight the management of cutting costs to make the company more efficient a task that they have carried out judiciously they also indicate the importance of exploration to find new wells a mission that has been quiet and if it is not done as soon as possible the country could be left without oil production since they only have proven reserves for  years estimating that current market conditions will continueecopetrol will intensify drilling in the second half after severe austerity thus ecopetrol plans to drill some  development wells in the remainder of  to end the year with around  of the new wells  will be drilled in the rubiales field  in castilla and the rest will be divided into other fields  we have privileged the axis of protecting cash and capital discipline but moving forward with a stabilized price that we expect around us    and migrating towards prices between us   and us   in  we already feel in the company that we can emphasize promoting reserves and production echeverry said in a conference call with investors as there was more box we could increase drilling he added the drilling of the new wells will be financed with the investment plan planned by the company for this year of between us   and us   million which had already been cut at the beginning of the year by up to us   million said the corporate vice president strategy and finance maria fernanda suarez meanwhile the official revealed that the oil company has covered around  percent of its financing needs planned for this year of up to us   billionecopetrol avianca and epm lead revenues in the first semester this money is equivalent to almost  times the debt quota that the bogota council recently approved for mayor enrique penalosa ecopetrol continues to be the queen of the countrys revenues despite the oil crisis the smart austerity that its president juan carlos echeverry has applied has allowed it to face crude that has hovered between us   and us   although they fell the oil companys revenues reached   billion ecopetrol received the rubiales and cusiana fields with which it currently operates more than  barrels per day the additional production of  barrels per day from the rubiales field counteracts the impact of lower investments and the temporary suspension of some fields echeverry explained after announcing the results in the winning lot there are also the empresas publicas de medellin epm which have had as a fundamental ally the diversification of their business abroad the good performance of aguas de antofagasta in chile helped its income to rise  and exceed   billion jorge londono de la cuesta epm manager told lr that for example the impact of guatape and the el nino phenomenon was mitigated thanks to the diversification of grupo epms portfolio in latin america the operation in colombia contributed  of the groups income and foreign subsidiaries contributed   the top of the five companies with the highest income in which avianca also managed to enter is completed by cementos argos which last week announced the purchase of heidelbergcement for us   million in the united states the grupo argos subsidiary obtained   billion in revenues with a growth of  compared to those obtained in the first half of  i emphasize that our regional in the united states continues to generate very outstanding results for the company both the cement and concrete businesses registered significant growth in volumes and sales during the semester its president juan esteban calle told lr grupo nutresa is also in the club for   billion in sales its president carlos ignacio gallego said that for the first time the accumulated ebitda of the last  months exceeded   billion for the manager this is consistent with the internationalization strategy more than  of the sales in this period were made from outside  gallego highlighted that the company was named highly innovative by colciencias earnings down but despite these behaviors the profit of companies has dropped  the profits of valorem isagen and etb were the ones with the greatest downward variation when compared between the first half of  and  for example the santo domingo family holding company had losses of   million as explained in the presentation of results segments such as media and entertainment had losses as well as retail sales despite the push it has had with  stores another of those that lost was avianca whose profits plummeted  as reported last week the net profit for the period showed losses of us   million about   million the first half of last year had registered us   million about   million the company explained that despite the fact that a cost reduction plan was implemented and indebtedness has dropped there was an impact due to a  decrease in passenger income the president of bancolombia juan carlos mora also warned that the results affect the taxes they face the strongest tax rate if compared in the countries where we have operations is colombia said the manager last week the el nino phenomenon also took its toll on the consolidated company as isagen went from making a profit to a loss due to the low water contributions that occurred during the semester etb also dragged the results lower as total costs and expenses remain in double digits enka and tecnoglass with the greatest variation the two companies that showed one of the best variations in their net income were enka and tecnoglass inc in the case of the former which is dedicated to the production and marketing of polymers and manmade fibers and whose sales rose slightly to   million went from having losses of   million to leaving a gain of   million the second company which is in the business of floating windows doors partitions and facades went from losing us   million to having a profit of us   million the opinion jorge londono de la cuesta general manager of grupo epm revenues were driven by power generation and distribution businesses both from epm and its subsidiariestwo new patents for ecopetrol were approved the first one allows water to be drained from the industrial facilities where hydrocarbons are stored and the second one allows the cleaning of pipelines for their transportation according to the oil company the first of the patents granted by resolution no  is called valve and float calibration process for water drainage in hydrocarbon storage tanks in refineries pumping stations and production fields  it is a system that makes the tank drainage operation more efficient by reducing the drag of hydrocarbons into the oily water system by almost  according to ecopetrol the first patent allows lower losses due to reprocessing and hydrocarbon evaporation reduction in the costs of water treatment for environmental compliance and lower health risks among others the second patent granted by resolution no  is called process for cleaning ducts or multiducts by means of suspended polyethylene particles and gels in this case the colombian company indicates that it consists of a methodology for the internal cleaning of hydrocarbon transport lines that combines polymeric gels and polyethylene spheres of variable density and size this invention facilitates the process of cleaning pipelines with diameter reductions due to deformations and bumps interconnection lines in process plants short lines and small diameters lines that have restrictions such as valves elbows and transport systems that they do not have facilities for the use of mechanical conventional cleaning tools  he adds in his communication the two patents are added to the  that ecopetrol already has of which four have been granted during the  termecopetrol will celebrate its  years of foundation the history of the company dates back to  when for the first time the government of rafael reyes regulated oil exploitation in the country in  the government handed over the exploitation in the magdalena medio to roberto de mares who in  transferred it to the american company tropical oil company this concession was of great importance because one of its conditions was the construction of the barrancabermeja refinery which was completed in  today that complex which at the time refined  barrels per day has a load of  barrels per day being the largest in the local market in the  the country experienced its first bonanza with a production of  barrels per day and in  the de mares concession was reversed which started the empresa colombiana de petroleos juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol highlighted through a video that three decades after its founding between  and  great discoveries were made such as cusiana cano limon and cupiagua which have supported colombias economic and social policy  the executive also highlighted that in the last  years the company has undergone changes such as the transformation of its legal nature to link shareholders and create the national hydrocarbons agency in addition he said that its transport infrastructure went from having  kilometers in  to more than  kilometers regarding refining echeverry said they went from a capacity of  barrels in  to almost  barrels today and in production he recalled that this year the company became the largest operator with a production of  barrels per day referring to the drop in oil prices echeverry said that this is a year of transition and the company is working to have sustained growth since  for that reason they launched the energy that transforms campaign which aims to highlight ideas and projects for the growth of the company of the workers hired by ecopetrol in the first semester were local this increase according to the company is due to bettertrained hiring due to better preparation and training in relation to the oil industry in the regions where this activity takes place in the first month of the year  jobs were generated through hiring through contractor companies while may was the month with the fewest hiring with  jobs by regions the state oil company that in the central region which includes operations in antioquia bogota bolivar boyaca caldas cesar cundinamarca norte de santander and santander registered the highest number of jobs with an average of  workers hiredecopetrol celebrates its  birthday with new goals this concession was of great importance because one of its conditions was the construction of the barrancabermeja refinery which was completed in  today that complex which at the time refined  barrels per day has a load of  barrels per day being the largest in the local market in the  the country experienced its first bonanza with

of transition and the company is working to have sustained growth since  for that reason they launched the energy that transforms campaign which aims to highlight ideas and projects for the growth of the company whats next for ecopetrol the state oil company set the goal of achieving an operation with the generation of value community management and the consolidation of a new exploratory activity which allows it to be profitable in the current situation within this task by  the company will seek to have a production close to  barrels of crude per day through techniques of mastery of the technologies that allow ecopetrol primary and secondary recovery taking the recovery rate to more  which would represent a growth of between  and  per year for this it must concentrate as indicated by its strategy on seeking the development of strategic fields and on a harmonious work with the communities to give space to oil activity in areas where social conflict has occurred with which that it must find the mutual benefit for the communities and the company with this panorama in mind the investments that have been raised are around us   million annuallyecopetrols duties are very great the uncalculated fall in international oil prices that began two years ago has had an effect not only on the oil market and raw materials in general but on the world economy which has been impacted in different ways the countries producers have suffered in their income and public finances in some cases more than others while importers have benefited from the lower payments to be made given that oil is used in about  in the transportation industry lower prices have brought a kind of lower costs in the global economy that is expressed in very low inflation and consequently lower interest rates by point that has come to speak of negative rates however given that in the economy there is no free lunch one of the victims with the low prices has been the companies linked to the business in its different phases which have had to adjust their finances due to the losses caused by the oil oversupply  the main reason for the drop in prices and which has led to a decrease in investment estimated at us   million last year alone due to the postponement of projects consequently internal operating restrictions have been felt in debt restructuring payroll cuts of  workers and renegotiation of contracts with suppliers ecopetrol could not be the exception and its data and results prove it losses reached   trillion the previous year and this year gives low profits after several years of being the dairy cow that governments used to maintain their expenses and now the picture is very different just to recall the past importance the company contributed in a decade between royalties taxes and dividends the not inconsiderable figure of   billion and the regions received   billion although it is in a period of adjustment and a drop in its income and profits the company continues to be strategic because the countrys oil future depends to a large extent on what it does and happens with the company since today around  of crude oil that is produced has to do with ecopetrol either directly or through associates and contractors the responsibility of the company its administration and board of directors goes far beyond distributing dividends or contributing money to the government of the day but its commitment is with the country and that route should be the priority it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a matter of national security which includes much more than a cut in administration expenses or in projects not focused on the center of the business the financial results are not the best but could be worse given the international situation the concern must focus on its future linked to exploration works whose balance is not goodecopetrols finances are solid juan carlos echeverry this was stated by the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry garzon in a sunday interview with the newspaper el pais from cali a city where he went to report to small shareholders how the oil company is doing which is  of the nation in the first year we focused on ensuring cash and capital discipline now we are turning the page financially the company is very solid  added the official in this context he added that the costs of extracting crude have fallen below  dollars per barrel which ensures a more profitable operation in this way  of production has been kept active and to this is added the positive dynamics of offshore investments in the gulf of mexico this year ecopetrols goal is to remain at  barrels equivalent oil and gas a positive and ambitious goal for a year that in january had prices of  dollars a barrel added the economist he anticipated that next year the countrys largest oil company and company will focus  on production after  there will be another transition and it will begin to be a more balanced company between oil and gas  we have discovered what apparently are new gas fields finally a reserved echeverry threw stitches on the joint proposal of the oil industry and the ministry of mines and energy that will be presented to the minister of finance mauricio cardenas in the face of the next tax reform what we are asking the government is to allow us to make an investment today that will be paid in the future  one of the ideas that is being raised is that there is a tax scale based on price let it be like an accordion let the taxation change depending on the price and for now i cant say more ecopetrol will receive almost us   million for contractor default for the third section of the high court the agreement agreed for the exploration and exploitation of oil in a sector of areas rich in hydrocarbons of cauca and narino known as condores would not have complied with the obligations agreed by the two firms according to what was studied by the judicial corporation during the first year of execution of the contract the contractor was obliged to reprocess the available seismic information and to reinterpret the existing geological and geophysical information work that was carried out without proof of inconvenience according to the state council the same would not have happened during the second year in which it was not demonstrated that the cocontractor acquired the minimum program of  kilometers of new seismic geological field cartography and geochemical research that included a most study to which he had committed faced with the alleged breaches ecopetrol initiated legal proceedings for the company to respond claiming prejudices derived from the irregularities that occurred in the execution of the contract finally the high court agreed with him the plaintiff company was authorized to make use of the power of unilateral termination of the contract provided that this does not become an abusive power because despite the fact that these types of agreements are governed by private law clauses like that they can be included in the exercise of the negotiation or disposition autonomy that governs the matter  highlighted the council of stateecopetrol responded to the sics indication of possible business cartelization in the first place it pointed out that ecopetrol has collaborated with the superintendency of industry and commerce so that the facts reported by the company since april  are investigated and clarified they also explained through a statement that the investigation refers to events that occurred between  and  additionally they explained that the oil company was the one who since last year reported being a victim of possible conduct contrary to free competition as a consumer of some goods and services regionally including the acquisition of stone material this had also been denounced last year by unions such as campetrol who explained that in the regions the operators had costs up to  above the real costs when they came to contract some goods and services ecopetrol reiterated that these illegal practices affect the finances and operations of the company sic statement according to the sic eco petrol would have consisted of encouraging suppliers of stone construction materials in acacias castilla la nueva and guamal meta to agree on prices and assign supply quotas offering ecopetrol as guarantor of the commitments arising in the framework of said agreements with their companies civil works contractors  apparently the agreements between the suppliers and the stateowned oil company were made through asomguaca an association that brings together the main suppliers of stone construction materials in the region which are the companies that possibly engaged in cartel behavior with other unaffiliated companies according to the sic the statement includes  natural persons in the capacity of officials or former officials of the companies involved accused of allegedly having tolerated executed facilitated and collaborated with the alleged anticompetitive conduct investigated this investigation proceeded with the collaboration of six whistleblower companiesgrupo exito surpassed ecopetrol and became the best seller carlos mario giraldo president of the company told lr that the consolidated sales reflect that the store that opened in medellin is already a multilatina which integrates the results of brazil argentina uruguay and colombia it gives a reality of what grupo exito wants and is an omnichannel strategy that brings together the physical and the virtual said the manager the company has  stores of which  are in colombia and it promotes two ecommerce strategies one in brazil and the other locally which will now focus on sales through exitocom and carullacom there is a great development in the synergy between the four countries for example the cash and carry format already has the first two months of sales it is a format that is gaining ground and with the advice of the brazilians we are launching it here  added giraldo the groups president even revealed that they plan to open two more stores next year under the surtimayorista brand presumably in bogota although the company recorded losses of   million the executive said that they are advancing a plan to reduce the blow of the debt for us   trillion that was acquired for expansion in latin america looking forward there is a strategy one is the recovery of brazil which will not happen immediately and will depend a lot on the recovery of the country the second is a judicious process of debt reduction through the optimization of working capital we have strategies to reduce inventories between four and five days giraldo explained revenues reach   billion for now the financial superintendency has published the results of  companies that when adding their revenues exceed   billion with an increase of  compared to the first six months of last year behind the success comes ecopetrol which fell to second place after reaching   billion the top five of the most selling firms are closed by epm with revenues of   billion grupo argos with   billion and avianca with close to   billion like exito the diversification of the businesses of these companies in the region was key to the good results for example the push given by the chilean aguas de antofagasta allowed epm to increase its income by  something similar happened with grupo argos which thanks to the dynamics of the infrastructure in the countries where it has a presence pushed its sales  more compared to the first half of last year we celebrate the steps of growth efficiency and reorganization carried out during this semester especially the expansion of the cement business in the united states the reorganization and targeting of investments in odinsa and the advances in profitability of celsia said the president of the group jorge mario velasquez despite the increase in revenue the reports that have been given this week confirm the downward trend in profits the  companies that have reported in the first six months of last year had added profits of   billion but now they are down  and fell to   billion apart from exito one of the giants that reduced its net income was avianca holdings to the point of generating losses although in the first half of last year it had reached about us   million about   million it now reported losses of us   million about   million although the number fell hernan rincon president of the company stressed that we handle seven million passengers with a very good increase in flows to europe and latin america the manager said that the results seem satisfactory especially taking into account external factors and also that the second quarter has been a difficult period for the entire industry isagen still affected by the weather conditions went from giving profits to generating losses of   million luis fernando rico general manager of the company explained that it has been a challenging period although he said that he hopes that with the return of the rains it will be a matter of time to recover despite the downward behavior and although it fell to second place in revenue ecopetrol was the firm that earned the most with   billion followed by the empresa de energia de bogota group with   million procafecol increased its sales by  the company that owns the juan valdez stores procafecol yesterday presented its balance to the financial superintendency in which it highlighted the  increase in its income during the first half of the year sales of the company reached   million while in the same period last year they were   million regarding earnings procafecol reported that the increase was similar  reaching   million in the first semester a figure that was higher than that of  when it had a result of   million opinion carlos mario giraldo president of grupo exito we are projecting a net profit at the end of the year but it depends a lot on the progress made in the debt reduction

the company explained in a statement with this they expect to increase production between  and  depending on the price changes but at average prices of us   per barrel production would rise to  barrels per day  higher than the current one explained the president of the oil company in exploration it is intended to incorporate at least  billion barrels of contingent resources by  additionally the financial flexibility of the ecopetrol group will allow inorganic growth options it was explained during the presentation the new plan also seeks to reduce more costs this year the goal of  was already achieved which was the savings of   billion for the future then it hopes that cost savings of up to us   million can be generated until  additionally it contemplates the divestment of assets in a range of us   million to us   billion echeverry added now if the price continues to rise towards us   per barrel the investment would rise to us   million from this capital the financing will come from a  capex savings that is close to us   million accumulated until  in production we are drilling a well with hocol in the piedemonte we are starting drilling in the macarena mountain range and the the next four months are expected to do two more in the meta  echeverry pointed out in his presentation in the case of ebitda per barrel with a price of us   it would go from us   in  to us

standards said echeverry also the company created four new drilling rigs within the continent and hopes to be more successful that in previous years this would generate in the  period the addition of

million therefore the colcap closed at  units with an increase of  compared to the previous day and so far this year the indicator registers a positive variation of rubiales would boost ecopetrols profits in this sense analysts consulted by lr expect that the company will have an average profit of   million for the third quarter which would accumulate about   trillion in the three periods that go to  data that would be verified with the presentation of result today for the results of the first semester of the year the president of the state oil company juan carlos echeverry stated that the priority of the company has been the protection of the cash through divestments cost reduction in some areas in addition of the opening of rounds to transfer stakes in  assets in various regions of the country in addition the company started to have the rubiales and cusiana fields with which the additional production of  barrels per day from the rubiales field counteracts the impact of lower investments and the temporary suspension of some fields echeverry said at the time  these factors especially rubiales would contribute to better performance with some qualms analysts said orlando santiago manager and analyst of fenix valor considered that ecopetrol the company could achieve   billion in the accumulated of the year and an increase in production of  compared to the second quarter this because it has been said that fields that were not profitable with low prices would be closed and oil prices have risen and some fields may have contributed santiago completed in this same sense camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones hopes that the incorporation of rubiales will boost the figures of the oil company despite detecting a reduction in the countrys crude production the lower production was reflected in the results of the second semester where the company reported a  reduction in its extraction reaching  barrels of crude oil equivalent per day boped the lower figures would come specifically from fields in la guajira although the rest could continue with a production similar to the one they have been registering so for katherine ortiz an analyst at davivienda corredores the decline in the fields and the decrease in investment of capex are issues to consider  another point that would affect the results that ecopetrol produced so far in  would have to do with costs average oil prices help the company the test is in costs and how efficient it can remain what we believe is that reporting profits will result from renegotiating contracts and reducing costs said diego franco cofounder of franco capital group who believes that this renegotiation of costs had a time condition  a third factor is the reserves that it can incorporate which will weigh on the results it reveals since according to the head of research for profesionales de bolsa felipe pinzon to be more optimistic we would need to see a significant increase in production and better reserves  as a consequence of the cost reduction ecopetrol could face lower crude oil sales hand in hand with lower investments due to the decline of the fields facts that would weigh on its results however the scenario is optimistic for the market petrolera expects production to grow by up to  ecopetrols business plan for  announced by its president juan carlos echeverry estimates that investment by  will be us   million  in exploration and production and where the pillars they will continue to be cash protection and cost efficiency the growth of reserves and production and strict capital discipline with which it is expected that production can increase between  and  depending on market conditions echeverry said that it is hoped to incorporate at least  billion barrels of contingent resources by  the opinion felipe pinzon head of investigations of stock exchange professionals greater investment in exploration would generate greater oil production which with cost savings would increase resultsecopetrol reported an ebitda of   billion in the third quarter meanwhile the average production between july and september rose to  thousand barrels per day that is an increase of  compared to the second quarter of this year for its part accumulated savings totaled   trillion which exceeds the proposed goal of   trillion during  under developmentmercado did not punish the fall in ecopetrols profits and rewarded the increase in ebitda this first section of the company had a substantial increase and improvement in its profits and reached   million compared to losses that had been recorded in the same quarter of  of   million this result despite lower sales was due to the optimizations and savings of almost   billion in the company for omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores it is important that expenses have fallen  this shows that the company has done its job well in terms of reducing this amount however despite the good work it is also clear that the company continues to depend entirely on the price of oil a variable that affects the value of the share and the results  following this line and according to analysts yesterdays rise in crude oil in the international market of  was the reason why the stock of the oil company registered a rise of  at   on the other hand compared to market expectations which expected a profit of close to   billion andres duarte analyst at corficolombiana explained that the difference was due in part to the performance of refining and petrochemicals which is negatively impacting operating results  on the other hand there is a deterioration in the transport and logistics segment which had a  drop in its profits and this has to do with the decrease in transported volumes and the tariff issue  in addition according to analysts it is essential that reficars figures be carefully explained in the presentation of results which has preliminary data and high costs that are not showing improvement another amount that the market highlighted was the profit before taxes of   trillion since this semester a provision of almost   trillion was made removing that effect the results were more in line with what the market was expecting which had calculated a tax rate close to  added duarte for the president of the company juan carlos echeverry it is important to highlight that the highest levels of ebitda and ebitda margin of the last five quarters were reported which reflect one the effectiveness of the austerity measures two the highest efficiency and cost reduction three the focus on capital discipline four the capacity as an operator and five the best crude prices compared to the beginning of   regarding the ebitda suarez stressed that the market will continue to monitor the relationship with the debt at the moment the margin is positive as a result of higher efficiencies he said the results of other companies in the quarter compared to its peers in the world the market celebrated that ecopetrol is among the few oil companies that registered positive net profits in the three quarters of  this was only achieved by total shell and exxon for the rest the  large oil companies in the world show some or all of the quarters in red for ecopetrol it is significant that the downward trend in production levels has been broken thanks to the entry of the rubiales field and barrels from ecopetrol america opinions andres duarte corficolombiana analyst the improvements in the exploration and production segment despite the price drop show that the company has continued to improve in terms of costs juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol it is important to highlight that during this quarter production grew  compared to the previous quarter reaching  barrels of oil equivalent per dayecopetrols share gained  and closed at   according to the analysts consulted by this medium this behavior was mainly due to the upward trend that the international price of oil has registered in recent days leading the wti to even reach us   per barrel in yesterdays session alone wti gained  and brent  in the second box was the title of cemex latam holdings with an increase of  to   and the third box was for celsia which rose  to a closing price of   for its part the largest decrease in the day was that of isagen with a negative variation of  to   in the second box valorem stood out for its depreciation a species that had a drop in price of  to   and in third place was preferencial avianca holdings with a decrease of  to   the stock with the highest trading volume was preferencial bancolombia with   million and a negative variation in its price from  to   the second place went to bancolombia with   million which registered a decrease of  to   and in the third box was ecopetrol with   million the colcap capitalization index closed the first day of the week at  units which showed an increase of  compared to the previous day according to the bvc so far this year the stock market indicator has registered a positive variation of  finally the colsc liquidity index had a fall of  and closed at  units and the colir registered a positive variation of  to a close of  units in mondays sessionecopetrol will invest us   billion in  and will double exploration and production resources specifically in production the oil company will invest us   million in exploration for its part us   million will be invested and the activity will be increased in six wells of this type the companys focus at this point will be on offshore investments the financing of the plan which also includes resources for us   million in refining and petrochemicals us   million in transportation and us   million in corporate expenses will be with cash resources and according to the company there will be no need for additional financing the idea of the company is to consolidate the bases that will guide the plan planned for  which seeks to increase production to a range between  and  barrels per day this interval will depend on the behavior of international pricesecopetrols exploration will rise  in  it is for this reason that the company is now betting on consolidating its portfolio and will go from four exploration wells in  to  in  now despite the fact that of these only five are offshore outside it is necessary to remember that each one of these drilling costs between us   million and us   million which is why the companys bet in this field will be us   million to the previous five wells is added the investment that is currently being made in the warrior well in the gulf of mexico later and in the short term ecopetrol explained to lr that it plans to drill the kronos delimiting well purple  and a new prospect  operated by anadarko these will allow greater certainty of the true potential of the caribbean they explained additionally two new unexplored prospects are added which will be investigated by the  and  wells the first of which will be operated by repsol and the second will be the first offshore drilling by ecopetrol also a well will be drilled in a structure close to the orca discovery in the tayrona block to evaluate the potential to the north said the oil company which according to experts has good prospects of improving targeting on the subject ruben dario lizarralde president of campetrol explained that these investments show a new air for the sector we hope that next year the activity will increase substantially which if added to the improved recovery methods will be able to increase the reserves in the short term since today they will close in five years for the country however there are certain concerns in the market about the total amount of investment in exploration we believe that it may be low when compared to the capacity of the company and if you consider that this type of exploration offshore is quite expensive explained diego franco cofounder of franco capital group in other segments the market saw positively the increase in investment in production by  to achieve  development wells record figures from previous years faced with the goals which seek to maintain production at  barrels andres duarte corficolombiana analyst explained that it is a fairly defensive strategy what is the same is completely valid if one takes into account that the protection of the box is sought  finally the analysts indicated that they are awaiting the decision on the delivery of dividends next year since it is better expected that these resources are added to invest more in projects the missing investments of this year and the action the action closed yesterday with a slight negative variation of    which is more linked to international data from my point of view the equilibrium price of the title will depend on the plans being executed perfectly with crude between us   and us   added diego franco on the other hand there is a question about this years investments which are close to us   million since only us   million had been made in the third quarter analysts are waiting to know what will happen with the resources of us   billion that have not yet been invested opinion ruben dario lizarralde president of campetrol ecopetrols forecasts are interesting since with recovery and new wells there is the possibility of not continuing to deplete reservesecopetrol will carry out a new round of sale of shares of empresa de energia de bogota this stage is part of the second stage of the disposal program carried out by the oil company to obtain resources to finance the  business plan the amount offered will be  million ordinary securities which is equivalent to  of the eeb the sale round which will not have a minimum purchase will be held before the start of markets and for

santana in puerto asis and nancy  maxine  burdine in orito and parex resources with one sogamoso in puerto wilches according to the oil company three of these six fields were not in production some have suspended their activity for more than ten years the other three currently produce about  barrels per day which is equivalent to  of the ecopetrol groups total production  this plan was within the new  strategy of the state according to its president juan carlos echeverry this process allows us to have fresh resources for the growth of strategic assets while generating shared prosperity in regions traditionally affected by conflict such as catatumbo and putumayo where oil will be the fuel for peace ecopetrol isa and grupo sura recorded the highest revenues in the quarter thus so far the companies that have reported the highest income of the season to the financial superintendence have been ecopetrol which reached   billion followed by isa with   billion and grupo sura which registered   billion in sales the state oil company ecopetrol obtained an ebitda margin of cop  billion which represents an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year this result reflects the effectiveness of the austerity measures the greater efficiency and cost reduction the focus on capital discipline its already proven capacity as an operator and the better crude prices compared to the beginning of  the company highlighted through a statement the second place in number of sales in the third quarter is occupied by the energy company isa which discounting the recognition of the rbse obtained revenues of   billion  more than that reported in the same quarter of  the net profit of this company amounted to   trillion presenting an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year and for now the ranking of the highest income of the quarter closes the antioquia holding grupo sura which increased its sales by  and managed to place its net profit at   million which implies an increase of   the results of this company are very positive in particular the level of income obtained the operational behavior the investment portfolio and the cash generation of this period stand out  explained david villan adcaps equity analyst among the latest reports released the behavior of the etb stands out which although it reported a net loss of   million this was lower than that registered in the previous two quarters and does not imply the outflow of cash it performed better than expected by the market there was a rebound in the ebitda margin reaching  due to greater control over costs and expenses due to its strategy of greater operational efficiency argued omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores one of the last to report was carvajal empaques whose operating income amounted to   million in the third quarter which implied an increase of  compared to the previous year for its part valorems income from ordinary activities

thus the bvc capitalization index the colcap closed on friday at  units down  compared to the previous day opinion omar suarez equity analyst at alianza valores there is great uncertainty about whether the slowdown in the economy could affect the portfolio of the rest of the financial institutionsecopetrol the best of the bvc with an advance of  on the side of the most important increases of the day the performance of ecopetrol stood out which advanced  to   in second place the shares that gained the most were those of valorem whose price increased  to   and completed the podium of the

million and bancolombias preferential with     million for its part in yesterdays session the colsc liquidity index also had a behavior rising  to  units as happened with the colir which increased  to  units finally in the colombian stock exchange a total of   million were traded in  stock operations followed by transactions with repos which reached up to   millioncut in production opep squares finances to ecopetrol after yesterdays meeting in vienna austria in which  of the  members of the cartel agreed to a cut of about  million barrels per day in the groups production thus leaving the pumping at  million barrels compared to the figure reported by the block in october  million the price of the commodity shot up by up to  leaving the brent reference close to us   under this price market analysts estimate that prices will continue to rise this year and in the medium term for example the goldman sachs team predicted that with this cut the first in eight years crude will be in the order of us   in  while analysts at barclays predicted according to expansion that this level will be surpassed quickly these projections settle the accounts for ecopetrol and on the way to the country given that the company has in its  corporate strategy plan to make investments priced at us   in other words any increase in the raw material will be beneficial for the company which plans to invest only a total of us   million annually in production to be around almost us   million in the period if the price of crude remains at us   per barrel but if it goes up and touches us   the total investment will be us   million broken down into us   million annually juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol mentioned that the investment plan in exploration is us   million which is more than double what was allocated this year in these accounts the rise in the price of crude oil above us   will be crucial since if it reaches us   us   billion will be invested between  and  according to the accounts of the companys optimized investments while if the level of us   million is reached the investment per year would be us   million in addition this would boost ecopetrols exploration operation which will have its first offshore drilling in the molusco  prospect for roberto steiner linked to the oil company and former director of fedesarrollo the most important thing is that the price predicted by analysts us    because that will have a more favorable impact given that the opec cut appears to be longterm and stable this situation that the analyst describes is also adjusted to exporting countries such as colombia venezuela mexico ecuador and even libya since for example the first of these made a budget close to us     billion for next year with a barrel at us   according to the medium term fiscal framework analysts such as luis fernando ramirez vicerector for research at the university of la salle said that if oil reaches us   with the exchange rate of   and a reduction in costs of up to  it would allow ecopetrol to have the levels of effectiveness from when the price was around   this revitalizes the country and it is a business that was not on anyones account and especially in view of the situation of the fiscal deficit suffered by finances he said once the market is toned and the idea of a fall in brent and wti benchmarks dissipates which according to experts would rise when in middecember the federal reserve raises rates to  the other oil exporters of the region will begin to see its balance sheets with better eyes for example venezuela would earn us   if a barrel of oil is priced at us   since it was with this value that it made its budget for  the same will happen to mexico which made accounts for a barrel at us   to leave its budget for next year at just over   billion although there was only a  probability of a cartel agreement it arrived and now it is up to nonmembers such as the united states and russia to help prevent pumping from increasing and thus not damaging the accounts of governments and ecopetrol however the possibility that the oil companies party with this reference price is not close if it is taken into account that according to expansion mohammed bin saleh alsada minister of energy and industry of qatar and president of the opec conference said that russia is committed to more than freezing its production and will reduce its production by  barrels a day in addition according to bloomberg other producers could add an additional  barrels to the cut in the short term production on a world scale has grown  barrels in the last year so it is expected that with the cut the excess supply will decrease and thus the companies in the sector will begin to reactivate their investments and in passing give a hand to the countries to which they pay dividends but it does depend on whether those shale producers pump again with the barrel for the order of us   saudi arabia assumed the largest cartel cut part of the expectation about yesterdays meeting was centered on how and who would be the countries that would cut production the most taking into account the geopolitical disputes that some members were going through after announcing the first agreement in eight years reuters reported that saudi arabia will be the one that will have the most cuts with  barrels per day followed by iraq which will stop pumping  and the united arab emirates with  iran will increase production by  opinions roberto steiner former director of fedesarrollo what public finances need is for the price between us   and us   to materialize over time just like the opec agreement because that way there will be a favorable impact juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol in  ecopetrol will invest us   million in exploration which is more than double what has been invested in this area this yearecopetrol sold  million of its shares in empresa de energia de bogota the price at which the shares were sold was

private companiesecopetrol saved   billion by reducing items this value increases by   billion more if we take into account what was saved in  which would add a total of   billion that the company has managed to reduce in costs to achieve this the state would have taken measures a little more austere cutting what was stipulated for items such as contract renewals and selling assets that were not leaving them the profits they needed among other various decisions that they thought necessary to face the hydrocarbon crisis however it cannot be said that with this number alone the company is saving itself according to the former president of the colombian petroleum association acp alejandro martinez this is only a part of all the decisions that are being made not only ecopetrol but all the oil companies in the world in the face of a difficult situation in ecopetrol they have reduced expenses but they have also made decisions regarding the type of projects to be attended saying that they will concentrate more on investments for production reducing investments in exploration and in everything that represents higher risks to production and that provides an interesting horizon for the company  explained martinez precisely regarding this type of reductions in an inside lr echeverry had said that more important than a growth of the company was the stability of the conditions in which they are currently which implies that at least there will not be a contraction the philosophy is stability is the new growth before growth was normal but when the price is at us   its time to stop drilling and even close fields and when that happens production declines so in a year in which the difficult thing was that there was no cash the decline began to be visible  explained the president continuing with that philosophy and reaffirming the investment plan that it had announced last year this  it will invest us   million in exploration which means an increase of  of what was allocated for this item in  in addition the investment that the company will make the company this year for all concepts will be between us   million and us   million this mainly so that production does not fall further and remains at  average daily barrels of oil although the presidents plans seemed a little less ambitious then today ecopetrol driven by more positive outlook for the sector and in the hope that predictions such as those of the financial times for a barrel of crude exceeding us   will turn out to be certainly it indicates that the number of development wells can exceed  now this does not neglect the savings goals that were set although the scenario seems to improve taking into account that echeverry himself affirmed that with a barrel at us   profits are already made the guard cannot be lowered yet so for this year the company seeks to save   billion that is to say  more than in  according to martinez this is good news because it corresponds to the right decisions they have taken and that are on the way to what all companies should aim for in times of crisis increase cash the goal points to  more efficiencies in addition to increasing the savings goal in its transformation plan ecopetrol also stipulated that the new efficiencies goal for  amounts to   billion the prices of the benchmark brent crude would be supporting these calculations made by the company because as reported the price of us   is leaving a good margin that among other things has returned profitability to most of the fields in this understanding the figures raised by ecopetrol which would represent a growth of  with respect to  could not be that far away taking into account the horizon they faced in  was much less hopeful opinion alejandro martinez founding partner of amv consultores at ecopetrol expenses have been reduced and decisions have also been made that gives the company an interesting horizon ecopetrol will hold the fourth auction on february  for the sale of securities in eeb the public offer of sale will be executed before the beginning of the negotiation of the ordinary round of shares of the colombian stock exchange the fourth auction is part of the second stage of this program and its objective is to publicly offer in colombia and abroad the titles of the oil company in eeb that were not acquired during the three previous auctions the disposal program which includes the second stage was approved by the national government in november  and its term was extended until december   through decree  of december  ecopetrol one of the  most valuable brands in the world in addition in the study which was the same one that repositioned google as the most valuable in the world after several years without winning the position the colombian was in sixth place in latin america behind five brands from brazil the main reason why ecopetrol was within the first  on the list was the  increase in its brand value at the end of  compared to the beginning of the year which amounted to us   million likewise it was also ranked  in terms of the position of the oil company with respect to other companies in the sectorecopetrol highlights the results of the barrancabermeja refinery in its  years the complex which today has  process units  storage tanks and nine industrial service units makes ecopetrol the main national energy supplier these results have been obtained thanks to the discipline and high degree of professionalism and evident creative and collaborative behaviors of our workers based on our institutional ethical principles that have allowed us to increase the capacity for conversion with the implementation of various initiatives said the manager of the refinery orlando diaz montoya and it is that only in the last eight years the company has made investments that amount to us   million within which the reconversion of the unibon unit to a moderate hydrocracking unit of diesel fuel stands out which allowed the production of diesel to be will increase to  barrels per day however the oil company also emphasized the implementation of new technologies that have been carried out since  for the treatment of the different types of water required for the refinery which has allowed them to reduce  of the water consumption captured from the swamp of san silvestre although the oil industry is not currently in the best of its moments which has caused the company to carry out a restructuring plan that allowed it to save   billion in  expectations remain high given the investment intentions that could amount to almost us   billion according to the acpecopetrol activates a contingency plan for an attack on the cano limon pipeline as reported by the entity the attack caused the oil to fall into a dry pipe

pipe that is located at the crossing of the cubarasaravena highway at this point ecopetrol located an operational checkpoint with a dam ecopetrol emphatically rejects these illicit actions that put peoples integrity at risk seriously affect the environment impede the wellbeing of communities and the normal development of oil activities the company said in a statement this attack joins another  that have been registered so far this year against pipelines in norte de santander arauca and boyaca the most recent being on wednesday in the municipality of el carmen the event left a fracture in the system and affected the soils and bodies of water an emergency that was addressed with an operational control point on the catatumbo river and the permanent control point of la gabarra however the environmental damage that followed the attacks could not be resolved immediately although the entity presented the pertinent reports immediately the fact was known in the village of la blanquita cubara the territorial councils of the disaster risk management of boyaca and arauca and the corresponding environmental authorities were informed he reportedecopetrol recorded proven reserves of  million barrels of oil last year this figure is  less than the total of  million barrels of oil registered in  according to the company chaired by juan carlos echeverry it is estimated that the price effect caused the greatest negative impact on reserves the sec price used to value the  reserves presented a  decrease compared to the one used in  going from us   per barrel of brent reference to us   per barrel if compared to the  reference the drop would be  since in that year the price was us   per barrel according to ecopetrol part of the effect was mitigated because  million barrels of oil equivalent were added which were achieved as a result of savings in operating costs greater efficiencies new drilling projects among these last projects the plans in the palaguacaipal fields and other extensions in fields such as castilla rubiales and chichimane stand out the reserve replacement index excluding the price effect was  by including the price factor the reserve replacement index stands at  the company said likewise it was reported that the average life of the reserves is  yearsecopetrols drop in proven reserves will hit yearend results according to a statement ecopetrol the proven reserves of the state oil company as of december   were  million barrels of oil equivalent mbpe which meant a decrease of  compared to the same period of the year earlier when they were  mbpe the first conclusion that some analysts draw regarding the fall in reserves is the obvious one the financial closure of the company this year is going to be hit hard by the  drop in the price of crude oil with which they are calculated as a consequence according to the casa de bolsa analyst juan david ballen the effects should also be seen on the profits of the shareholders taking into account that the decrease in these reserves means that the viability of many of the projects that had it decreased precisely because of the fall in the price of crude oil after the announcement made by ecopetrol in the morning the oil companys share on the colombian stock exchange repeatedly touched a low of   from an opening price of   according to ballen the expectation of the share price is that it will continue to fall towards   and this is not the only consequence derived from this report one of the figures that caught the attention of analysts was that of the years of life of the reserves which this year was calculated about  according to casa de bolsa the fall in the stipulated time has been showing since  when it went from  years in  to  years a situation that will be a challenge for the oil company that has managed to greatly reduce its expenses and that every day seeks to be more efficient and make profits with a barrel at us   for the economics professor at the politecnico grancolombiano carlos fernando martinez with this investment expectations in the sector decrease and that translates into a decrease in national gdp so that the incentives for industrialization will have to be increasingly higher since those of hydrocarbons continue to decrease their participation however in dialogue with lr the minister of mines and energy german arce affirmed that this statement is not entirely true taking into account that the investments in the sector for this year which the acp stipulated in us   billion will not they will decrease the calculation made on the proven reserves is completely economic and does not mean that the resources disappear but that there are resources that cannot be exploited at the moment but they are there said the minister on the contrary the expectation is that we are going to recover the investment speed we are going to have more barrels of production and thus we will be able to recover part of the reserves that remain buried in the subsoil in this balance concluded arce the rise in the price of a barrel seems to be not so clear although in the hydrocarbon sector hopes remain of if not an increase at least a stabilization of the prices at which crude oil is sold in the international market for the analyst from casa de bolsa juan david ballen the chances of a decrease are now even less there is an imminent risk that the fed will raise its interest rates more than once this year that would make the dollar revalue and due to the inverse relationship between the price of the currency and the value of oil the price of crude oil would begin to fall  thus the recovery could be blunted by a prolongation of the crisis opinions juan david ballen analyst at casa de bolsa we are expecting that ecopetrol in its final report as a consequence of this reduction in the number of reserves will not make a profit or be very low carlos fernando martinez professor of economics at the grancolombiano polytechnic the fact that reserves are being reduced is a clear sign that the country must be thinking about other products to export so that it can compensate a little in gdpecopetrol generates knowledge through collaborative means with universities ecopetrols main objective is to generate knowledge through collaborative means with educational institutions and within the company arango said that the offer is based mainly on specific competencies in different businesses where it is established which competencies are required by each of the companys areas arango affirmed that ecopetrol has specific technical training programs where it is established whether each of the operators is suitable for their work this occurs through the transfer of knowledge through the operators where they demonstrate their conditions to operate and there it is guaranteed that the employee can carry out their professional practice the main development occurs in improved recovery programs to promote future developments in oil fields finally he highlighted that the organization last year was the winner of the global make award at the regional level for successful knowledge management where more than  companies were presented and  were the winners of stature such as apple microsoft and ibmecopetrol surpasses its peers in the world in increasing investment while in  us   million were allocated for production this year it is expected that us   will be injected for the same purpose that is  more exceeding the expectations of experts and analysts in addition for its exploration activity ecopetrol will also increase its resources the estimated investment of the oil company is us   million which would exceed the investment of us   million last year by  the goal this year is that we can add between  million and  million barrels on average in continental territory we only hope to have an aim  last year we reached  barrels per day which is  barrels above the goal we had said its president juan carlos echeverry the new investment budget was released less than a week after the oil company revealed a  reduction in its proven reserves explained by international oil prices which caused this impact thus according to several analysts consulted by this medium the announcement could be understood as a strategy to counteract said loss which occurred as a consequence of the fall of almost  in the price of crude oil on which the company had to make its calculations in this the minister of mines and energy german arce agreed who told lr that the loss of proven reserves does not mean that the resources disappear but that there is no capital to exploit them this balance is the result of the adjustment in prices that we had last year that makes some projects no longer economically viable but the question is whether the prices that are currently in place are sufficient to make them viable again said the minister however he affirmed that through the investment the level of reserves can be recovered taking into account that in this way the companys income could be increased and in turn obtain a higher budget for the projects that were suspended during   can be resumed this year with better conditions we are going to recover the speed of investment we will have more barrels of production and we will recover part of the reserves that in that balance were buried in the subsoil completed the head of the portfolio top five on the list the only nonus company in wood mackenzies top five investment was ecopetrol the others are all from the north american country the first to appear below ecopetrol is marathon oil corporation whose investment will increase only  percentage points less than that of the colombian it is followed by continental resources with an increase of  cabot corporation with  and noble energy with  destined values are still lower than  even though the variations in investments in  are very high compared to what was injected in  these values are still much lower if compared to what the companies used in  for production and exploration  according to wood mackenzie ecopetrol will invest  less than it did then marathon will continue to be below  and continental will do so with  however three companies will increase or will not change the value of  the opinions juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol the goal this year is that we can add between  and  million barrels on average in continental territory we only hope to have aim  german arce minister of mines and energy we are going to recover the speed of investment we will have more

shareholders and financial institutions because there it will be announced whether the company will deliver dividends or not depending on the strategy adopted according to its results although there is no certainty in this regard the truth is that the market had already handled the possibility that this year a delivery would not be made again taking into account that in february ecopetrol reported that the proven reserves at the end of  had decreased something that will undoubtedly affect the financial statements presented by the company what happens is that the effect generated by the fall in reserves could cause a fall in profits casa de bolsa analyst juan david ballen told lr on the other hand the company announced that the ordinary meeting of the general shareholders meeting will be held on march  although the shareholders have the right to inspect the books and other documents from march  simon gaviria would not be on the board at the time the minister of finance mauricio cardenas said that this year the director of the dnp simon gaviria will not be nominated to be part of the board of directors of ecopetrol in this way the country would comply with the

investmentcolombias largest refinery boosts ecopetrol revenue in tough times the barrancabermeja refinery the most important in the country expects to raise the conversion rate of each barrel of oil into fuel and other derivatives to  at the end of  from  last year the increase in the supply of products from the industrial complex generated resources for ecopetrol of about us   million in the last two years equivalent to between  and  of the total cash of the oil company a trend that will continue in the next years refinery general manager orlando diaz told reuters the figure is not negligible considering the difficulties that the company has had in recent years due to the collapse in oil prices which led it to reduce its exploration activity to a minimum which meant that the average life of its proven reserves will decrease to  years at the end of  from  years at the end of  undoubtedly to the extent that we have been able to improve our conversion levels into a greater supply of fuels there has also been a better economic response from our refinery in such a way that we have contributed to the improvement of ecopetrols cash flow and to ensure that there is a balance between production and refining said the manager it is a way to achieve the contribution to improve the economy and  to help ecopetrol to move forward in these difficult times in which oil prices have fallen he explained in an interview in this hot city of the central colombia the magic of molecules the fall in ecopetrols income led the company last year to suspend the modernization plan for the barrancabermeja refinery estimated at some us   million to refocus as of  on increasing exploration and production production the situation has led diaz and his team of about  people who work in the  complex to seek better use of the plants and to focus on what he calls the magic of molecules to expand their product portfolio with investments estimated at about us   million for this year part of what has been the ingenuity and creativity of our workers is in terms of the recomposition of some of our final products by means of the elaboration and recomposition of molecules  with the crude that today we are using to enrich them improve them their physicalchemical properties to achieve placing them on the international market he said as an example two years ago the refinery began to export a high quality reconstituted crude called castilla norte which arose from the mixture of various byproducts resulting from new refining processes in another recent diesel purification process the refinery was able to break down and produce sulfur in high demand with a capacity to process  barrels of crude oil per day the barrancabermeja refinery produces liquefied propane gas regular and aircraft gasoline diesel solvents lubricant bases paraffins propylene asphalt and sulfur among othersalmacenes exito would exceed ecopetrols sales last year zero hour for the colombian oil company will be today and it will hold its traditional conference call at  in the morning in bogota according to analysts consulted by lr although there is some optimism with the results the companys annual revenues would be in the order of   billion below the   billion announced by grupo exito juan david ballen an analyst at casa de bolsa said that it must be taken into account that ecopetrol reported in february that reserves had decreased which could cause a drop in profits for her part angie rodriguez ultraserfinco equity analyst stated that they have an expectation that ecopetrols net profit will be   million for a total so far this year of   trillion now this is not a negligible figure taking into account the crisis that the sector had rodriguez added that according to the analysis they have made the expectation is based on the fact that this year there was an oil price  higher than the same quarter of the previous year in addition we have an exchange rate that is practically the same  for that reason we believe that the higher price and the stable rate will favor the results this quarter  according to the analysis of camilo thomas equity analyst at alianza valores revenues for the fourth quarter will be   billion while revenues for the year will be   billion the expert also calculated that net profits for the year would be   trillion angelica quintero adcap equity analyst added that although they do not have an estimate of how much the income would be located he stressed that the price of oil again affected ecopetrol data this year the same as last year although we expect a recovery with regard to profits the same thing as last year which was negative will not happen but it will recover and there will be a small profit  if the forecasts are confirmed exito would maintain the position it achieved in the third quarter of last year when it consolidated in the first place as the best seller in the country in august the company led by carlos mario giraldo had already had revenues of   billion while the firm led by juan carlos echeverry placed its sales at   billion giraldo highlighted the performance of the textile sector throughout the year selling  million garments and the ambition to expand this unit in the countries where they are present although the firm wants to invest   million in its retail sector the truth is that its president like echeverry with oil is cautious about what can happen to the consumer given the threats posed by the vat hike after the tax reform and the low level of trust terpel closed the year with   billion in revenue one of the companies that is usually located in the top of the largest also reported its results last week terpel announced that in  it achieved revenues of   billion with growth compared to  the firm also announced that its profits were   million avianca holdings was another of the firms that reported and highlighted that unlike what it had obtained in  thanks to its cost reduction policy it returned to record profits this week the bogota telecommunications company and canacol are also expected to report while the bogota energy company would do so the next week opinions angelica quintero adcap equity analyst we see that the price of oil again affected ecopetrols revenues this year the same as last year although we expect a recovery juan david ballen brokerage house analyst what happens is that the effect generated by the drop in oil reserves could cause a drop in ecopetrols profits read terpel obtained   billion in revenue in attack against ecopetrol vehicles in boyaca leaves a driver injured only one transport vehicle of the  that were in the caravan was affected after the events in this the driver was injured according to the state oil company in a statement the remaining nine tank cars continued their journey although escorted by members of the public force although the origin of the attacks against motor vehicles is unknown it is presumed that they could be attributed to the eln guerrilla which was probably also behind the  attacks on oil pipelines in the country that occurred in  in the statement ecopetrol he rejected the violent acts and stated that they endanger not only the company but the civilian population in general these attacks put peoples lives and integrity at risk violate human rights put the integrity of communities at risk and prevent the free exercise of the right to work said the oil companyecopetrol must return under its jurisdiction the oil price crisis began during the last quarter of  when a barrel of crude fell in price with levels above us   to reach us   at its worst value in the following years the blow was not only felt in the finances of the mixed oil company but in the colombian state coffers given that the company spent more than   billion in the national budget each year in the worst period and once the crisis was assumed ecopetrol only contributed   trillion a practically insignificant figure for colombias social investment needs but crises come and go in the same way and you have to learn from them a reality that the top management of the company must apply to the table not staying in the past but looking forward to continue growing and helping the country grow its new president former minister juan carlos echeverry has led a process of quite radical organizational change in which he has not only cut unnecessary expenses saved money on lean cows optimized processes and renewed many old guard officials but has also done ambitious investment plans according to the situation and that are well judged by experts in the field todays ecopetrol which holds its general shareholders meeting where around half a million shareholders participate is very different from that of  now it faces a different environment more adjusted to its potential and with different scenarios reficar and campo rubiales are two of those positive elements that make it very different today two realities that did not exist three years ago and that are props for financial growth and proven reserves hopefully the board of directors approves a symbolic dividend for shareholders as a gesture of recovery and confidence let us remember that the last time that the joint venture approved this benefit for the holders of its papers was in  when  of the profits were distributed at a rate of   per share we know that the stick is not there to make spoons but it is the right time to send a message of recovery into the future the secondary market analysts and those of the macroeconomy do not agree with distributing dividends for the  fiscal year which is a conservative position we are sure that if the restructuring process that ecopetrol is undergoing was well mounted and is working it would be an indication of true recovery that a yield of a share worth   is delivered especially when the first buyers bought them for   and the second ones at   ecopetrol is an economic institution the top player in the colombian stock exchange a provider of resources and an investment object for thousands of colombians how important it was that the shareholders took something that belongs to them or some product of what they have investedecopetrol registered a net profit of   trillion in  and proposes to distribute dividends on the other hand production amounted to  kbped in  exceeding the proposed goal for the year by  kbped ebitda stood at   trillion ebitda margin  despite having  kbped less production and a  drop in the average price of brent compared to   was a year of enormous challenges for ecopetrol the oil industry experienced the lowest crude prices in the last  years and therefore investment cuts materialized the search for efficiencies and liquidity became the mantra to cope with the crisis to this scenario were added the challenges imposed by the negotiation of the peace process the closure of the border with venezuela the phenomenon of the child the completion of the reficar and bioenergy projects and the approval of the tax reform ecopetrol focused its efforts on reducing costs producing profitable barrels prioritizing investments strengthen the cash register and at the same time maintain its investment grade rating said juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol in the balance sheet another point highlighted in the oil companys report is that the fourth quarter closed with a robust cash position of   trillion approximately us   billion which made it possible to reduce financial leverage and enables inorganic growth opportunities he says the press release regarding well operation the company reported that the resumption and operation of the rubiales and cusiana fields demonstrated its operational capacity today ecopetrol operates more than  barrels of oil equivalent per day directly in addition the recovery program is classified as a reality with  active pilots during  of which  showed increases in production in this phase  million barrels of accumulated oil reserves have been the contribution of the program an important part of these results was achieved in large fields such as castilla and chichimene the entity explained juan carlos echeverry in statements to caracol radio said that this year we are going to explore  of our wells in the colombian caribbean we are going to explore five of which one has already been completed on which we will announce its news as soon as anadarko and we will drill a well in the gulf of mexico so that these  exploration wells allow us to celebrate at the end of the year  distribute dividends to its shareholders on the other hand the company indicated that it will propose to the shareholders meeting to distribute   million in dividends that is   per share this corresponds to  of the profits before impartialiments which means that a person who has   million in shares of the oil company if the proposal is approved by the assembly would receive about   in dividends although this value is not high compared to what was distributed two years ago echeverry assures that it is good news for the stock market in addition ecopetrol reported that for this year it will contribute   billion to the state in taxes and dividends it is equivalent to almost what the tax reform will collect  gdp highlighted the oil companyecopetrol share the second most traded of the bvc today according to the analysts surveyed by lr the behavior of the state company title is in line with the downward variation of all the titles on the stock market today however although it does not show dissatisfaction with the results it does reflect the concerns that are still latent such as the reserves all the shares are falling in addition there are aspects that continue to worry such as reserves said angie rodriguez an equity analyst at ultraserfincoecopetrol restores trust to shareholders this was proposed by the company led by juan carlos echeverry in the  financial results report presented to the financial superintendence in the report despite low international oil prices the business group reported a net profit that amounted to   trillion  more than that registered in the previous year in total the company indicated that it will ask the shareholders meeting to distribute   million in dividends which corresponds to  of the profits calculated before impairments in an amount of   billion although this value is   per share less than what was distributed the last time it paid dividends in  it was   echeverry assured that this is good news for the stock market which was severely punished by the crisis of crude oil prices worldwide ecopetrol focused its efforts on reducing costs producing profitable barrels prioritizing investments strengthening cash and at the same time maintaining its investment grade rating in total it will contribute   trillion to the state in taxes and dividends which is equivalent to almost what the tax reform will collect  gdp  said the president of the company through a statement according to analysts surveyed by lr this dividend reflects a signal to regain the confidence of investors in the stateowned company which in turn will have to deal with the challenging external situation and manage to raise reserve levels which fell in  by the price effect the results were in line with what was expected by the market management in terms of costs made it possible to achieve these good figures this dividend will favor the perception of shareholders the cash position of the company is in the capacity to distribute that   highlighted angie rodriguez equity analyst at ultraserfinco in general the analysts consulted perceived these neutral results with a positive bias so if this good streak continues the company could begin to distribute little by little greater dividends until reaching the levels between   and   per security that it has granted in the last five years although historically low the dividend came out above expectations there are several players in this decision on the one hand a state with urgent financing needs where it helps to alleviate the burden from the fiscal point of view and on the other a challenging environment with oil levels above us   but they do not reach us    determined omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa in the midst of this economic situation the distribution of this dividend also generates certain uncertainty as analysts assure that the companys challenges are still great it is important that the entity increase the level of reserves maintain sustained oil production continue with a strong cash position continue with a greater reduction in costs and optimize resources in more profitable projects said suarez regarding the level of reserves echeverry announced that it is one of their top priorities this year and that they will drill  wells including five in the colombian caribbean for the rest among the  business results of the oil company it was highlighted that the ebitda remained at   trillion and that the total investment amounted to us   million in addition the groups production amounted to  barrels per day in  surpassing the proposed goal by  this despite having had  barrels of oil equivalent per day of lower production for  days due to the closure of the cano limon covenas pipeline and a  drop in european brent as for the fourth quarter of the year it closed with a robust cash position of   billion which allowed a reduction in financial leverage and enabled inorganic growth opportunities and regarding the operation of wells the company reported that the resumption and operation of the rubiales and cusiana fields demonstrated its operational capacity the title of the stateowned company did not change despite the good reception of ecopetrols business results the title of the oil company did not change in its price yesterday and remained at   on the colombian stock exchange bvc  although the stock picked up at the beginning of the day it began to fall due to the slight decline in international oil prices and latent concerns of the company such as the low level of reserves in addition this role was one of the most traded of the day at the wheel opinions omar suarez manager of equity at casa de bolsa although the results came out as expected by the market with a dividend that will relieve the state there is still skepticism about the low level of reserves juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol for  the investment in exploration will be us   million which would go from two to six offshore wells and from five to  wells within colombia read ecopetrol share the second most traded of the bvc todayhow did ecopetrol fare when comparing its figures with  other companies beyond the net profit of   trillion that the company detailed and the dividends that are planned to be distributed   for each title ecopetrol is consolidated as one of the most robust companies in the region and in the world this is reflected in a report in which there are  companies including ecopetrol two firms have not delivered results of which only five delivered profits in the four quarters of  exxon total sa shell repsol and ecopetrol are part of this select group with positive profits in the last four periods although for the national firm of the last seven quarters only one has been negative fourth quarter  omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa commented that despite the difficult economic situation currently being experienced ecopetrol is one of the few companies in the world in the oil sector that generates profits and distributes dividends when comparing the results with other pairs ecopetrol presented a growth of  taking into account the figures in dollars and  taking into account the variation of last year only exxon total sa shell and repsol exceed the variation of the national oil company with percentages of    and  respectively the other firm that registered a positive variation was bp with  suarez added that the fact that the firm is diversified in exploration and production businesses pipeline transportation and the refinery generates a whole integration on the other hand most oil companies suffer a lot because they only have one line of business  it is worth remembering that the price of oil has recovered but a barrel still does not reach us   the average price of oil last year was us   while in  it was us   when detailing each quarter the trend was increasing since in the first the average value was us   in the second it was us   in the third us   and in the last us   with these reported values the companies continue to register impairment which is a punishment in the accounting that does not affect cash taking into account the price of crude oil with this the colombian company established itself as one of the least affected with a negative variation of  although there are others with less impact such as marathon oil hess and conoco phillips with  on the other hand juan felipe pinzon analyst at profesionales de bolsa said that the decrease in costs helped the reduction in income not hit ebitda in short the decrease in costs was greater than that of income and this made if it had a positive ebitda margin  the calculations established that ecopetrol had the best ebitda margin during  with a variation of  last year it was also the best with  the other companies such as marathon oil  statoil  oxy  and anadarko  are the companies that complete the top five with a high ebitda margin in percentage regarding reserves ecopetrol reported good numbers but they are not the best compared to the region according to the ranking it is located in position  with  billion barrels above are exxon  shell  chevron  eni  conoco phillips  statoil  oxy  marathon oil  and anadarko  below ecopetrol is hess with  billion barrels finally pinzon emphasized that the payout which is the difference between the dividend per share and the earnings per share was going to be  according to the roadmap but now with those   that are going to be delivered or to discuss in the assembly on the last day of this month it would be  that is very high this means that it would be a very high dividend  the opinion juan felipe pinzon analyst of professionals of stock market the management of ecopetrol made that the reduction of costs helped that the reduction of income did not hit the ebitdaecopetrol reported a gas discovery in caribbean waters as the company announced in a press release the discovery is located  kilometers from the

in mature fields according to the president of the company today the oil company concentrates  of the operation of the  pilots to increase the recovery factor while the remaining  is under operation of the partners to know the potential of the findings ecopetrol will have to estimate the reserves and the possible production a task that usually takes a little more than two years time to start producing who will be the partners of the company for the exploration campaign expected for this year the state oil company will have seven partner companies both in the wells it will drill on land and offshore for the activities it will carry out in deep waters in the country and in the gulf of mexico it will have anadarko mcx ongc repsol petrobras and statoil in the case of the explorations

acquired read ecopetrol assembly will be on march ecopetrol produced  barrels of oil per day in  this figure is equivalent to a decrease of  barrels per day compared to the previous years results and the lowest seen in the last five years including the natural gas production figures the value increases to  barrels of oil equivalent per day for a decrease of  barilles compared to  according to echeverry the main reason for this decrease was that they were left to produce what he called unproductive barrels because these generated losses and not profits for the company that was a painful decision but a wise one especially since we are now producing profitable barrels not barrels for barrels there was a time when we were taking out a barrel that cost us   and we were selling it for us   and those barrels have to be stopped he said adding that this year we are waiting for  barrels to  again   the president stressed that this year the price below that of brent at which colombian crude is sold is us   so there was a profit of us   per barrel taking into account that in previous years the barrel was at us   below the reference value read ecopetrols general shareholders meeting beginsecopetrol shareholders will receive a   dividend per share at the table of the board of directors three other proposals were presented one that proposed doubling the value of dividends that is leaving them at   another that asked that it be   per share for minorities without delivering anything to the state and allocating the remainder for exploration and another in which it was asked not to pay dividends and invest it in the company the dividend money will be paid according to the two options that have been raised in the meeting that is through a bank consignment or the payment in cash for minorities given the refusal of the state proposal by the vast majority of minority shareholders the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry affirmed that as a shareholder he would also have wanted said value to be higher although it was necessary to understand that the state oil company had made a great effort last year to achieve the financial results that were achieved precisely echeverry highlighted the fact that despite the fact that operating income had presented a drop of  in  registering figures of   billion they managed to maintain an ebitda of   billion despite the  prices we made a profit by cutting costs across the company the price was challenging for all of us thats what the world gave us in this sense maintaining ebitda at   billion despite the fact that revenues fell it has been a great effort for the company  said the president of ecopetrol during his speech still the taste left to shareholders is not entirely sweet the depreciation of the shares they bought at   in the first issue and at   in the second and which today stands at   makes the owners of the titles not convinced furthermore because if you invested   million in the first issue you will receive   in dividends and if you did so in the second you will be able to claim   according to calculations made by camilo thomas a stock market analyst at alianza valores however according to the equity analyst of the brokerage firm although the depreciation did occur the truth is that in the cash flow of the shareholders the total will always be positive since this does not necessarily represent a loss but rather the fact that they stopped earning on their investment cash flow is always going to be positive because until last year he had already received the value of what he invested in the shares the rest already represents profits now there was a depreciation because in the first issue a share was bought at   but at the same time the stock went out the value jumped to   however it is more of a sentimental issue that you have bought a share at one price and now it is at another said thomas other figures that ecopetrol presented to its shareholders corresponded to its plans for this year as has been said on several occasions in  there would be a total investment increase of us   million to the us   in  the largest value would be destined for production at which point us   million would be destined next would be exploration us   million specifically destined to increase reserves it should be noted that one of the promises was exploration in putumayo where it is said there are great opportunities the minister of mines and energy german arce zapata affirmed that we are going to recover the speed of investment to have more barrels of production and recover part of the reserves that in this balance remain buried in the subsoil the problem of cost overruns one of the issues that generated the most stir in the assembly was the cost overruns that arose due to the construction of the cartagena refinery reficar in this regard echeverry said that like everyone present he was also dissatisfied with the results that the great work had presented just as you must have i also have a dislike for reficar but our mission was not only to finish this work as soon as possible but to save the company that we can generate  said the company leader in the same vein he said that it is important to understand that today this project is already closed and that it is not generating more losses for what from now on will be profits reduce production so as not to lose more in the management report ecopetrol announced that in   barrels of oil were produced per day that is  barrels per day less than the previous years results however according to juan carlos echeverry the main reason for this decline was that what he called unproductive barrels stopped being produced there was a time when we were taking out a barrel that cost us   and we were selling it for us   and those barrels have to be stopped said the president of the firm the opinions of german corredor energy observatory of the national university in order to increase profits you have to increase production and that will not be achieved if you do not invest in exploration camilo thomas equity analyst at alianza valores cash flow will always be positive because until last year it had already received the value of what it invested in the sharesecopetrol subsidiary registered branch in angola according to the company this process is carried out as legal compliance after the withdrawal of the company from two exploration blocks the registration of this branch is done with the purpose of complying with the legal requirements of angola derived from the stakes that the

expectations in commerce and services and with difficulties related to the high interest rate which restricts consumption and triggers the overdue portfolio indicators of financial entities  soto pointed out that one of the fundamental problems for the commerce sector was the fall in the consumer confidence index icc which in january of this year stood at  which slows down the acquisition of

year registering sales of nearly   billion during  and the opening of its  store opinions jose roberto acosta professor of cesa the topic of the retail trade closed very badly last year as it did not behave as expected as it only grew  this not only happened in  but it comes from  due to the effects of the devaluation which has depressed the sector  sergio soto executive director of fenalco

antonio ocampo recounts in the publication decade of great transformations the brief coffee boom of  allowed the beginning of a period of recovery that was also promoted by for the beginning of one of the phases of greatest growth of minor and mining exports in the history of colombia  in that era oil and other commodities were already the kings of the industry and the companies that registered the highest sales for  were the leaders in that sector ecopetrol esso colombiana and codimobil the first recognized for being the largest stateowned company dedicated to oil exploration and production while the other two subsidiaries of exxon and mobil in colombia respectively were direct competitors in the lubricants and fuel stations market ecopetrol remained on the podium in the revenue ranking during those years while in  their reports showed sales of   million by  the figure was already billionaire and exceeded   billion although the three oil companies remained in the ranking by income esso colombiana and mobil de colombia which for that period got rid of the codi prefix when mobil began to buy shares in the firm fell to positions three and four respectively because they had to make a place for the national coffee fund which registered   million avianca bavaria coltejer the grancolombiana merchant fleet colmotores cadenalco and sofasa were the companies that completed the top  of the best sellers of  but things changed for  as three companies got on that list and displaced coltejer  sofasa and the fmg texaco almacenes exito and the national coffee fund there were also other movements avianca had a decline from fourth place to tenth between  and  while general motors colmotores formerly colmotores climbed from eighth to sixth place meanwhile the grancolombiana merchant fleet which had been the flagship of the countrys exports since the end of world war ii entered a crisis due to economic openness which brought to the region the largest shipping companies in the world that saw with good eyes to enter a territory little explored for international business this situation led to it lifting anchors in  and associating its working capital with the mexican transportation maritime mexicana tmm for ricardo bonilla professor at the national university and former secretary of finance of bogota one of the main problems for the countrys productive apparatus was the little preparation of companies to face an open market as it was proposed in the early  it allowed multinationals to enter without major obstacles to control both the national and regional market  who sent for profits while in  the profits of the  largest companies by sales reached   million a decade later the profits had grown to add up to   billion in this sense cesar ferrari professor of economics at the javeriana university highlighted that the effect of economic policy decisions such as the one with the greatest devaluation that occurred in the  can be observed in the results of the companies when looking at the profits of the companies the effects of the opening that the country undertook and the advances in technology were observed in  for example industrial companies such as bavaria peldar carton de colombia technology companies like ibm and manufacturers like fabricato but in  the diversification of the market led to new companies starting to rank among the largest taking out ecopetrol which leads the list of profits and income other reports such as celumovil showed the first stone of the cell phone business in the country in that era of oil leadership celumovil profits reached   million which led to it occupying position eight in the ranking of the most winners it is worth remembering that the awarding of licenses for the operation of these companies in which comcel also entered was carried out during  for example of the  companies that reported the most profits in  only one remained in that ranking in  it was about bavaria the gains recorded while president belisario betancur passed command of the country to virgilio barco were in the order of   million a decade later ernesto samper already in his second year of government and with a constitution in the process of regulation approved during the mandate of cesar gaviria the queen of the beer business reported a green balance of   million this figure was only surpassed by ecopetrol and carbocol which had profits of   million and   million respectively another aspect to highlight is that bavaria was alone representing the beverage sector in the top  of the companies with the most profits but by the end of the  century new players appeared in these lists in the colombian market such as cerveceria aguila and postobon the nine companies that came out of the ranking of the most winners in  were hocol ibm propal isa peldar fabricato monomeros colgate and carton de colombia the opinion ricardo bonilla former secretary of finance of bogota one of the problems that arose in the economic opening for companies was that much more efficient companies came to the national market winning not only the domestic market but also the regional one cesar ferrari professor of economics at the pontificia universidad javeriana one could say that in macroeconomic matters the country did well in that decade when compared to others in the region that went into default but the structural problems of a closed economy were not adequately overcome ecopetrol rejects the attack against cano  limon covenas the attack that for now is attributed to the eln generated an oil spill that contaminated the stream that supplies the regional aqueduct the guerrillas have activated an explosive charge against the pipeline located in the guaimalito district some  peasants living in the area would be affected by the environmental emergency so ecopetrol has already activated a contingency plan and rejected the attack the company asked people close to the area to move away from the place while the damage was repaired with the support of the army the passage of crude oil through the pipeline has already been stopped while the company manages to reach the areadividend of   will be

granted by the general assembly that took place on march  let us remember that this payment was suspended in  and that the amount they decided to deliver this year corresponds to  of the profits

no later than tuesday may  finally the company also reported that the financial results for the first quarter of this year will be released on thursday may  read on thursday may  ecopetrol will present the results of the first quarterecopetrol confirmed the third finding in the caribbean and confirms a deep water gas province as explained by president juan manuel santos this would be the largest gas discovery in colombia since  and with the finding we will have guaranteed gas supply until  which will be able to generate more employment that the economy will to grow more that we are a more attractive country for foreign investment  in addition he stated that colombia is going to maintain its position of importance in the world not only in economic matters but also in hydrocarbons this last well is part of the purple angel block which in turn borders fuerte sur  and fuerte norte in this  zone ecopetrol reported that it shares a  stake with anadarko which is the operator the latter company also informed the market that the well set a record for the country as it passed through the largest sheet of water in the history of offshore drilling with  meters these being the first analyzes the oil company is confident that a development cluster can be established in place we are pleased to be able to announce this third discovery in the southern colombian caribbean the results confirm that colombia could have a new province for the production of gas a clean fuel and growing demand in the international market this discovery will be important for the future of colombias gas supply the exploratory successes of the caribbean are part of ecopetrols strategy which as of  focuses on increasing hydrocarbon reserves for which we have more than doubled investments for exploration said the president of the oil company juan carlos echeverry the minister of finance mauricio cardenas commented that ensuring selfsufficiency of gas protects the pocket of households and competitiveness of companies on this subject the vice president of distribution of promigas rodolfo anaya explained that the consolidation of a deepwater gas province on the caribbean coast and of a specific cluster alized in gas production it is a reliable source of supply for the country which should translate into benefits and reliability in the service for home users for national industry and especially for industrialists on the caribbean coast ecopetrols gas finding opens up for more investment to come this year the gorgon purple angel and kronos findings total an area of  square kilometers  times the area of bogota and could be compared according to preliminary samples with the chuchupa and ballena discoveries in  cano limon in  and cusiana and cupiagua in  this as explained by the minister of mines and energy german arce would increase the demand for the blocks that remain to be delivered in the anh round since in the world  there are no new provinces to explore most investments are made in resources already developed here a whole new front is opening  that increases the interest of the area assignment agreement that was updated last month and where we are scheduled to have a round in the second semester  regarding the specific finding what ecopetrol has indicated is that more than us   million have been invested and more than an additional us   billion will be needed for development in addition the company explained that based on the studies of the final volumes in houston they are defining the following phases and options to declare marketable gas this step will depend on the market and the regulatory conditions given by the government to export also because within the economic analysis that is being done if there is a sufficient volume an investment in a liquefaction plant is included as is being done in other countries on the contrary if the volume is not so high the company would have to analyze whether it is attractive to make an investment that allows it to deliver gas to the national market regarding this particular issue arce explained to lr that the hydrocarbon sale plans would be directly related to exports since these exploration and production projects are marketed in international markets  and today there is no regulation that prevents it from being sold it is different from the regulation of rates of the gas pipelines of the local public services  this being the case regarding local supply the same figures that the government gave last year are still maintained which show  cubic therapies that are enough for  years consumption for this reason the minister did not rule out the project for the pacific regasification plant since he pointed out that it is a discussion to support the domestic system we gave signs of what would be required in infrastructure to guarantee the supply not only in electricity but for industrial use clearly that area will contribute to the reserve balance but it is a discussion that will take place later because reaching the first molecule will take between seven and  years  market awaits commercialization and resources for ecopetrol the next step in addition to analyzing whether the volume of reserves is sufficient to make the required investments will be to follow up on the discharge law of the ministry of the environment which would regulate future work in addition in order to strengthen its share which yesterday rose  to   it will have to deliver to the market the complete studies of the form of commercialization and investments to get this gas on this last point diego franco president of franco group explained that when the market sees details can know how much is added to the reserves and where the resources will come from the action will respond better opinions juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol the exploratory successes of the caribbean are part of ecopetrols strategy which as of  focuses on increasing hydrocarbon reserves rodolfo anaya vice president of distribution at promigas the consolidation of a deepwater gas province on the caribbean coast and a cluster specialized in gas production is a reliable source of supplyattacks affect ecopetrols profit in the first months but in contrast there was also little encouraging news for the state oil company that could affect the profits that it will release to the market next thursday according to some analysts this is in particular the series of  attacks that the cano limon  covenas pipeline has suffered by illegal groups and that would have affected the production of crude oil by the company for camilo thomas equity analyst at alianza valores this would be the main negative factor in the financial results of the first quarter of the oil company because it had to drop production due to the attacks on the pipeline so we do not see a quarter very positive  leaving an approximate profit of   million in this period ecopetrol has emphasized that this type of attack on its infrastructure in addition to affecting the communities and the environment of the regions also has an impact on the normal development of oil activities thomas explained that the calculations take into account that the attacks are reflected in the countrys production since there is a high correlation with ecopetrols production these indicators do not predict such a favorable quarter however the result is positive when compared to the first quarter of  when the company posted a net profit of   million which according to orlando santiago an analyst at fenix valor who considered that there is a good combination of prices for both oil and dollars it is a good combination for the countrys extractive industry although production may have decreased due to some closures in cano limon this is a cost that is associated with the level of production so there should not be any significant impact on the quarter said santiago who bet on profits of up to   million despite the good news of the gas discoveries with which ecopetrol has already completed seven discoveries in the last two years and which is due in part to the fact that the company set itself the goal in its strategy plan to increase the budget for exploration this year is us   million double that of last year would not have a major impact on the results of the period this because according to thomas findings have been discovered but they have not been quantified and the entry into production takes more or less six years so it is too early to measure the impact  while for santiago if these benefits are met it would be almost half of the total earned in ecopetrol today delivers its balance sheet for the first quarter in  the oil company achieved an oilonly production of  barrels per day bpd a figure that had already been falling compared to the barrels extracted in  when it extracted  according to minminas in the first three months of  the average would show a national production of  bpd if the oil company produces close to  of the total in the first period of the year it would yield a figure close to  bpd lower than the  barrels in the first quarter of  these figures do not take into account gas production which in  gave  barrels equivalent of crudeecopetrols savings plan would reduce risks in the year the state oil company faced the oil price crisis with a savings strategy that led to a cost reduction of   trillion in various sectors which contributed to better financial and operating results a scenario that may continue to favor it for  savings according to analysts would continue to be one of ecopetrols advantages in reducing situations such as attacks and prices as well as boosting exploration activity as indicated by the companys strategy in the short term according to catalina tobon manager of strategy and economic research at old mutual the process of strengthening ecopetrol through its savings plan helped to improve the companys indicators and allows it to have one more floor in the future clear the potential is for improvement and a rebound in terms of results although the environment is volatile given that the company is healthy and an effort was made to focus on the issues of strengthening its indicators it is a company well prepared to face its situation  tobon considered it was precisely this management of resources that allowed the oil company to launch a robust production and exploration plan compared to other companies in the sector while in  us   million was allocated for production this year resources of us   million are expected that is  more in the case of exploratory activity the investment that the oil company has estimated is us   million  higher than last year camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones considered that although the savings plan will continue to be implemented this year its impact will be less than in  when the sector experienced its highest peak of the crisis the expert considered that the bulk of the savings plan occurred last year but it will be consolidated as part of the exercise they have done to be more efficient the challenge for the oil company in the coming year is to maintain production figures if one takes into account that in   barrels equivalent oil and gas were achieved per day exceeding the proposed goal by  barrels as indicated the president of the oil company juan carlos echeverry although with a reduction of  compared to  dollar would not be a stimulus for now although the price of oil grew and is close to us   per barrel analysts consider that conversely the dollar contracted slightly which may not be a differentiator for now in this sense catalina tobon considered that in the long term beyond the results of the quarter ecopetrols outlook is positive due to its savings and its investment budget opinion camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones ecopetrol will benefit from the price of a barrel since at the beginning of last year it was the lowest and this year it was relatively sustainedecopetrol closed the first quarter of  with a profit of   million in terms of volume the largest contribution came from sales of gasoline and middle distillates which had an increase of  and  going from  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped to  and from  to  respectively active commercial management helped capture market opportunities in international sales generating a significant improvement in ecopetrols export basket for the quarter the differential between brent and the crude oil basket was us   per barrel better by us   compared to the same period in  said the president of the oil company juan carlos echeverry according to the company the transformation plan which included structural savings of   million with the goal for the year being   million also allowed the quarterly ebitda to reach   trillion the highest in the last two years and a ebitda margin of  comparable with  in the same period of the previous year  now in terms of crude oil volume the attacks ended up affecting sales by  barrels per day and lowered revenues by about   million average production was  barrels of oil equivalent so far this year there have been public order situations and operational events such as the temporary closure of the cano limon  covenas pipeline which negatively impacted our production the pipeline returned to normal as of april  likewise we highlight the good performance of hocol and ecopetrol america which contributed most of the  increase in the production of subsidiaries compared to the first quarter of  added echeverry regarding exploration a point on which the market had been insisting the report highlighted that during the quarter ecopetrol had three important achievements the purple angel and  discoveries on the colombian coast and boranda in the middle valley of the magdalena  regarding reficar it was reported that tests of four additional plants were completed reaching a total of  units which represented an advance of  compared to the  units of the refinery the barrancabermeja refinery had a stable operation consolidating itself as an efficient and profitable refineryecopetrols net profit in the first quarter of the year increased  according to the report published in the financial superintendence ecopetrols net profit between january and march of this year amounted to   million which represents an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year when the figure was   million the same positive behavior was registered in the category of total sales where the oil company added   billion in the first three months of the year a figure  higher than the   billion registered in the first quarter of  regarding ebitda the figure amounted to   trillion which was highlighted in the report as the highest in the last two years reaching an ebitda margin of  and a solid cash position of   billion  structural savings for the quarter amounted to   million with the goal for the year being   million savings for   million of lower cost of dilution of heavy crude stand out it was specified in the balance sheet according to the report these results demonstrate greater efficiency and cost reduction through the transformation plan capital discipline and better crude prices and margins against brent likewise the report highlighted that during the quarter ecopetrol had three important achievements in its exploratory campaign the purple angel and  discoveries on the colombian coast and boranda in the middle magdalena valley demonstrate our commitment to operational excellence the document says ecopetrol had an outstanding first quarter of  we feel confident with the corporate strategy and the results obtained we have overcome challenges to achieve a profitable and safe operation that is reflected in the financial results said ecopetrol president juan carlos echeverry  the average production data was  barrels of oil equivalent the company explained so far this year there have been public order situations and operational events such as the temporary closure of the cano limoncovenas pipeline which negatively impacted our production the pipeline returned to normal as of april  likewise we highlight the good performance of hocol and ecopetrol america which contributed most of the  increase in the production of subsidiaries compared to the first quarter of   regarding reficar it was reported that tests of four additional plants were completed reaching a total of  units which represented an advance of  compared to the  units of the refinery the barrancabermeja refinery had a stable operation consolidating itself as an efficient and profitable refinery sales by volume ecopetrol reported that in the first quarter of  the groups total production fell  kbped thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day or  compared to the first quarter of  which was reflected in a reduction in the volume sold that reached  barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to  barrels of oil equivalent per day this value represents  of total sales compared to the first quarter of last year of total sales  went to the domestic market and the remaining  to the international market exported in the first quarter of  was  barrels of oil equivalent per day presenting a decrease of  compared to that registered in the first quarter of  the report readscenit once again raised its face in the ecopetrol results for this period the groups transportation company was once again the groups company with the highest returns amounting to   million despite a reduction in the volume transported the strength of this company was recognized by the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry who assured that the transport segment has consolidated its business integration although cenit has had to face several closures over the course of these months on behalf of the  attacks it has suffered even so echeverry highlighted that the negative impact was reduced thanks to the fact that the reversal of the bicentenario pipeline was achieved to evacuate crude from the cano limon field and thus mitigate the impact of eventual closures however for the cesa professor jose roberto acosta it is not positive that ecopetrols most profitable activity is the transportation of crude without progress in exploration and production for acosta there is no strategic change after the price crisis that point has not been specified to achieve optimization of all business lines and they continue to depend on logistics activities such as transportation although the market already took for granted that there would be a negative effect from the attacks orlando santiago an analyst at fenix valor considered that this is a cost that is associated with the level of production therefore its impact on profits should not have be very strong added to the efficiency of the companys expenses however cenit was not the only subsidiary of the state oil company that contributed to the  growth in first quarter profits if one takes into account that the subsidiaries increased their oil production by  some of those that stood out the most were hocol owned  by ecopetrol which performed well due to the start of operations at the gas treatment plant for the bongamamey fields as well as the reactivation of some operations due to the lifting of precautionary measures additionally the entry into operation of the gunflint field in the gulf of mexico boosted the crude production of ecopetrol america without reficar six ecopetrol subsidiaries posted profits of   billion in the quarter another fact to highlight was the savings of   million in the period from a goal of   million at the end of this year the opinion of jose roberto acosta professor of cesa the market did not take into account the findings that have been announced and in terms of exploration there are no discoveries ecopetrol was favored because of the priceecopetrol and epm are the companies with the highest sales in the first quarter ecopetrol and epm led in sales the first reached   billion and an increase of  compared to the same period last year while the second achieved revenues of   billion although it had a decrease of  both companies also posted positive earnings figures the oil company achieved a net profit of   million and a variation of  compared to the same quarter of  while epm achieved the highest variation with  and a net profit of   million in third place was cementos argos a company that had   billion in revenue although it reported a  decline its losses were   million which translates into a decrease of  according to the company it was due to the revaluation of the colombian peso the winter season in the united states and a large supply of imports that led to lower prices this does not intimidate the president of cemargos juan esteban calle who assured that we are in all the large housing projects in the country we

structure the potential is for improvement and rebound in terms of results ecopetrol has shut down  wells in meta due to acts of violence according to the complaint from the state oil company a call was made to the protesters to cease the de facto actions and allow the normality of work while requesting the intervention of the authorities for the restoration of public order in this municipality where about  barrels of oil are produced per day  this alert was launched by ecopetrol after experiencing a new act of violence in its facilities on behalf of hooded men who affected a drill and forced the workers in this infrastructure to abandon their operation this attack on the independence  drill which is located in the el triunfo village in acacias meta was added to the fire of an ecopetrol truck and the opening of the valves of several wells which caused a spill of crude oil that it has not been possible to control because the protesters prevent the entrance to the emergency groups according to the companys warning the oil spill could reach the danta pipe which in turn empties into the orotoy river which would have strong environmental consequences the workers of the oil company have also been victims of the attacks that have occurred since may  in this area of the country where strategic wells are located for the companyecopetrol has shut down  producing wells due to offensives the actions that have been carried out since may  have left workers threatened a burned truck and an oil spill that has not yet been controlled and that already puts at risk the danta pipe that flows into the orotoy river according to information provided by the oil company although the people who are carrying out the different attacks that have already left the workers of the independence  drill without supplies have not yet been identified it is said that they may come from representatives of the community action boards that make up the community corporation of juntas de juntas community action in the san isidro de chichimene area of direct influence cjaid ecopetrol requests the intervention of the authorities in this area where  barrels are produced per dayecopetrol denounces threats and sabotage in magdalena medio in the past hours protesters have opened valves on tanks containing oil and damage was reported to  wells likewise to block the roads the protesters resorted to cutting down forests these blockades have prevented the free movement of  workers the protests are carried out regarding the socialization and application of decree  of mintrabajo which refers to the hiring of local labor in municipalities where hydrocarbon exploration and production projects are developed ecopetrol invited the community to maintain spaces for dialogue with the municipal mayors office the la cira infantas project and leaders of the el centro district to reach agreements to restore normality in the oil fieldecopetrol denounces blockades in la cira field through a statement the company stated that acts of violence have increased in recent hours for example they denounce that the protesters opened valves of tanks that contain oil and damage was registered in  wells likewise to block the roads they resorted to cutting down forests these blockades have prevented the free movement of  workers who work at la cira infantas according to ecopetrol the workers have also been intimidated and forced to leave their workplace this situation has prevented control tasks from being carried out in the operating areas with the risks that this means for people and the environment  according to what lr learned there are  motorized vehicles the spokesperson has five directors of the community action boards and they are asking that ministers of labor and mines go in addition some of the affected people say that there are leaders of the union sindical obrera behind the issue precisely from the point of view of the company the protests are carried out regarding the socialization and application of decree  of the ministry of labor which refers to the hiring of local labor in municipalities where exploration projects are developed and hydrocarbon production in this regard freddy pulecio union leader of the union sindical obrera uso pointed out that the main drawback in relation to said decree is that it privileges the municipal capitals and not the area where each project is carried out people reject it because it denies the possibilities of work  ecopetrol invited the community to maintain spaces for dialogue with the municipal mayors office the la cira infantas project and leaders of the el centro district to reach agreements to restore normality in the oil field the union leader also pointed out that in addition to this trigger there are two other reasons the first is that people see that since the project arrived companies have met their goals but their conditions are increasingly difficult said pulecio the second reason added to the protests is a resolution that breaks down environmental barriers that protect aquifers and communities with this you can drill to  meters when the allowed is   alejandro martinez president of gasnova assured that the entire oil industry is suffering from blockages that affect not only production but also the country to attract oil investment meanwhile for hernando barrero an expert in the oil industry this situation is quite worrying and extremely inconvenient for the country it is a foolish way to claim something that the community supposedly has to do with the industry it is not an acceptable procedure  for now it is expected that the blockades will be lifted and agreements will be reached with the communities the opinion alejandro martinez president of gasnova these blockades affect not only ecopetrol but also the oil industry and the country because they reduce the ability to attract investment in this sectorso far this year ecopetrol has faced  blockades in fields so far this year the oil company has had to face  blockades in different areas of the country with the two this week being the ones that hit its activities the most these are the protests which led to attacks on the companys infrastructure registered in acacias meta and santander in cira infanta the oldest oil field in the country the report that ecopetrol has made in the meta accounts for the closure of  wells due to sabotage and seizure of the facilities leaving not only workers attacked but also a reduction in production of  barrels per day in cira infanta the production of  barrels per day has been affected and  wells have been shut down also due to blockades and violent actions against employees and equipment a source from ecopetrol assured that the protests come from the community action boards since decree  of the ministry of labor took away the function of contracting since they charged commissions to deliver contracts now it can be contracted through the public system of employment where people should not pay the director of employment of the mintrabajo miguel angel cardozo said that unfortunately this type of process generates resistance in communities where there were population centers with mafias that monopolized access to vacancies creating quotas to keep the jobs offered by the companies of hydrocarbons  with this outlook according to btg pactuals head of research sergio olarte the company will be affected in terms of shortterm production that goes against the rebound in the extractive industry which already had an effect in the quarter the march in barranca ecopetrol had to explain that the barrancabermeja refinery is not going to be scrapped nor is it going to be sold as a consequence of the march promoted by the mayor of the city although the company postponed the planned modernization plan for about us   million it has made investments to maintain its operation due to the importance of this plant the manager of the barrancabermeja refinery orlando diaz assured that there is permanent updating of assets the finetuning of the facilities and general repair of the units an important investment is maintained this year they exceed   million said diaz ruling out that there are plans to stop the operation of this plant the opinion sergio olarte head of investigations at btg pactual the attacks are more difficult than the blockades because they leave havoc on the company and secondary effects such as spillsecopetrol was the stock that rose the most in preference among analysts according to the financial

company was known in a statement it indicated that the company will file the legal resources in order to obtain the revocation of said decision for the exploration analyst at the national university juan carlos morales the seriousness of the matter would affect future operations in the region especially because it is an area that has the capacity to produce  barrels of crude per season after

the viability of a hospital improvements in the infrastructure of a school in addition to establishing a territorial ordering plan that allows determining the uses of the territory the office of the

formulations will be made for thermal recovery and hydraulic stimulation projects this laboratory could also advance technology for gas discoveries in the offshore caribbean in addition it will have cells in the knock mechanics laboratory which will allow to know the real behavior of the rocks in the reservoirs which will be able to anticipate the risk of collapse of the wells and reduce nonproductive times in drilling as reported by the institute the main destination of the resources will be the acquisition and updating of equipment which will be added to the current technological infrastructure of  laboratories  pilot plants and more than  scientific equipment many of them unique in latin america for the research in the oil and gas sector said a statement the institute highlighted that in the last three years the icp has signed four strategic alliances for joint research and codevelopment of technologies with investments that exceed   million which have generated more than ten prototypes of technological products more than  professionals and academics have been involved in these processes refinery boosted ecopetrols market value for analysts the market is misjudging those two types of assets in fact in the case of the refinery they expect that between  and  it will generate positive cash flows of us   million to   million for the first time in eight years given the stability of the cartagena refinery the increase in the bioenergy ethanol and a better sales mix  meanwhile for the midstream segment they expect there to be stable flows of more than us   billion annually given the startup of growth projects and cost saving initiatives precisely in the delivery of the results of the first quarter ecopetrol indicated that there were structural savings for a value of   million from an annual goal of   million in relation to the upstream or what is commonly known as exploration and production for hsbc analysts ecopetrol benefits from a favorable pricing policy and tax regime although the stock has been devalued due to the low life of the reserves and a poor exploratory record  according to hsbc recent caribbean oil and gas discoveries such as gorgon purple angel south bullerengue boranda and warrior will undoubtedly provide further support even if international oil prices remain low for longer in fact the report highlighted that ecopetrol would continue to have a positive cash flow even with oil prices between us   and us   per barrel thanks to a better downstream line another point to highlight was the new management team that seems to be more attentive and diligent and recognize that the company has to partner with international operators juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol recalled that the commitment to profitable growth in exploration and production and the creation of value for shareholders is firm for hsbc the stock should cost   and not   as fridays price the opinion juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol our commitment to profitable growth in exploration and production and the creation of value for shareholders is firmecopetrol and terpel were the leaders in sales in

companies it can be found that five belong to the mining sector ecopetrol terpel reficar exxonmobil and cenit three are from the services sector epm claro and avianca one from the commerce sector exito and one from manufacturing bavaria according to the supersociedades classification when adding the  revenues the figure reaches   billion which if compared with the sum of  of these  same companies shows a growth of  do not forget that the revenues of these companies in  reached   billion in the income table ecopetrol takes the highest place on the podium by reporting to supersociedades the figure of   billion what would be the silver medal or second place was in the hands of the terpel organization which registered a figure of   billion the third place went to almacenes exito having an income in  of   billion it should be remembered that these figures are not consolidated outside the podium empresas publicas de medellin epm was placed in fourth place with revenues of   billion followed by claro with   billion and avianca with   billion already in the sixth box for income the place is occupied by the cartagena refinery reficar when reporting to the supersociedades an income of   billion meanwhile bavaria was left with the seventh box registering revenues of   billion the last two seats are occupied by exxonmobil and cenit with a revenue of   billion and   billion respectively according to gustavo acuna associate professor at the national university of colombia the results of the companies confirm that the country continues to depend on economic activities such as oil partly explained by the large investment however the location of the  largest companies in group  is concentrated according to the supersociedades balance sheet in the centraleastern region with six companies ecopetrol terpel claro bavaria exxonmobil and cenit the other four companies are divided equally for the caribbean with avianca and reficar and the coffee axis added to antioquia a region represented by epm and almacenes exito when looking at the results of group  in the report of the superintendency of companies the first place went to koba colombia better known among consumers as  having a revenue of   billion the second place went to coopidrogas which had an income before its supervisor for an amount of   billion while the third box was occupied by copservir with a record of   billion in this list it stands out that the economic sector that leads group  in terms of income and in the classification of the  largest companies is commerce this at the reason that eight of the  are in this category it is also noted that nine of the  companies are from the centraleastern region while only one is from antioquia and the coffee region casa luker for sergio soto executive director of the national federation of merchants fenalco in antioquia  was a tough year for economic activity in colombia that affected different sectors and ended up impacting

income of   million the eighth box was obtained by casa luker with   million ninth place went to gunvor and tenth to epsifarma opinions sergio soto director of fenalco antioquia the companies in  had a difficult year due to the uncertainty such as the tax reform and affected by work stoppages gustavo acuna associate professor national university of colombia with the results it is still observed that economic activity continues to be highly dependent on the mining and energy sectorecopetrol expands exploration while facing low reserves colombias state oil company will allocate us   million of its us   billion budget to finance the exploration of  wells including five offshore in colombia and one in the gulf of mexico executive vice president felipe bayon pardo said in an interview in nueva york thats more than double the   million the company spent last year ecopetrol is responding to investors concerns about its low level of oil and natural gas reserves which at the end of  was estimated at  years the company said in february that is far below its regional peers including mexicos state oil company petroleos mexicanos which has reported reserves  times greater than ecopetrols ecopetrol is also looking to grow through acquisitions bayon said confirming the companys previous  month deadline while letting it be known that the company will jump on an opportunity if it presents itself sooner while the finance minister has said that ecopetrol plans to increase investment he said the company will continue to be disciplined with its spending we are not going to spend it just because we have it he said the company remains profitable even with current low oil and gas prices bayon said new projects are tested against a base price of us   a barrel for brent the global benchmark brent crude fell to   on wednesday after us government data showed gasoline stocks surged due to weak demand ecopetrol has suffered several operating suspensions this year in its cano limoncovenas pipeline as a result of guerrilla attacks and more recently due to the discovery of illegal valves that forced the company to declare a case of force majeure in some of your shipments the company is currently repairing the pipeline and those interruptions have not affected this years production target bayon said with the cartagena refinery in the testing phase the company does not plan to build any more refineries or pipelines in the near future he addedin a difficult year ecopetrol and terpel were leaders in sales despite this panorama ecopetrol and terpel were the companies with the highest sales volume the first with   billion and the second with   billion to balance these difficulties the companies according to francisco lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp sought to be more efficient reduced their operating costs and were more selective when investing this adjustment that all companies made was necessary although in some cases painful this is what is allowing them to produce with a price range of us   a barrel said lloreda however not everything was negative for alvaro younes president of fedispetrol there was a favorable balance in retail distribution thanks to new rules and measures that generated consumer confidence in relation to the outlook for the current year the moderate optimism that led to the calculation of investments in the sector at us   billion may be affected according to the acp by blockades attacks on infrastructure and mainly by consultations popular which accentuate legal uncertainty regarding the latter lloreda reiterated his call to the government to lead a procedure that leads to specify the powers in the field of hydrocarbons and the scope of popular consultations better prices for the barrel for german espinosa president of campetrol this year the industry could recover one of their arguments is related to the price of a barrel according to the us energy information administration eia the average value would be us   in  and us   in  for the brent benchmark in turn entities such as wood mackenzie citibank and bbva have agreed that it is difficult for its value to be below us   and other experts even assure that it could reach us   espinosa saidecopetrol would go for  oil blocks in mexico these areas are located in the gulf of mexico in the provinces of tampicomisantla cuencas del sureste they classified  bidders  individually and  consortia presented grouped proposals ecopetrol classified individually through the firm ecopetrol global energy slu to apply as a team the company formed three consortiaecopetrol would go by blocks in the gulf of mexico these blocks are in shallow waters that is shallow waters in the gulf of mexico in the provinces of tampico cuencas del sureste and veracruz according to the cnh likewise the government of that country expects investments to reach a value of us   billion the final list included  bidders of which  will participate individually and  in consortium in total  companies from  countries will participate such as shell chevron repsol lukoil among others ecopetrol classified individually through the firm ecopetrol global energy slu and also through three consortia the first with noble energy mexico and pc carigali mexico operations the second only with pc carigali and in the third it was associated with pemex it is important to remember that ecopetrol within its  business plan outlined that among its strategic priorities in exploration is the search for new reserves at an international level with a focus on the gulf of mexico brazil and other areas of the americasecopetrol will reactivate exploration in meta the  well will be drilled in a new property in the montecristo village while  will be drilled in a private property that ecopetrol acquired in the pio xii village  and  contribute to the objective of increasing ecopetrols reserves to maintain the countrys oil selfsufficiency the company said in a statement both are part of the contract signed with talisman owned by the oil company repsolecopetrol won a tender in mexico for the extraction of light oil the block area where the company will begin the works will be in a space of  square kilometers this will be in association with the malaysian company pc carigali as they were the winners of the tender this is part of a plan by the mexican government that seeks to authorize drilling and mineral extraction in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico within the tampicomisantla veracruz and cuenca del sureste oil provinces similarly from its twitter account ecopetrol trilled we have just won a block in shallow waters of mexico together with its partner pc carigali good news for colombiaecopetrol was awarded two blocks in mexico immediately from its twitter account the oil company wrote we have just won a block in aguas someras de mexico together with its partner pc carigali good news for colombia minutes later the cnh returned and issued a second ruling in which it granted additional permits to ecopetrol again in this way the main colombian company managed to enter mexico through the front door winning two tenders in areas of high hydrocarbon movement in the gulf of mexico this achievement is part of the strategy to strengthen and diversify exploration and production activities in colombia and abroad with the aim of increasing hydrocarbon reserves thanks to this the ecopetrol group has operations in the united states brazil peru and as of today mexico  explained the president of the company juan carlos echeverry in total  bidders disputed  contractual areas of the gulf of mexico within the tampicomisantla veracruz and cuenca del sureste oil provinces ecopetrol through its subsidiary ecopetrol global energy was declared the winning bidder for two blocks in the southeast basins together with petronas and pemex the first was area  which has an area of  square kilometers in that block it will operate together with its partner pc carigali mexico one of petronas subsidiaries with an operating profit in favor of the government of  and an additional investment factor of  equivalent to one well for its part the second block won by the colombian company was area  which is even larger and reaches  square kilometers in territorial extension in this block the strategic partner was pemex de mexico and an operating profit was offered in favor of the government of  and an additional investment factor of  points the fact fits the company like a glove since it comes from a year in which given the international oil prices and their effects on sales in colombia it needs to take a breath with new operational opportunities and that is where the relevance of competing in the market of other countries in addition it adds a new territory that will serve for its international recognition something very important for a company that represents colombia abroad  added the petroleum engineering analyst at the university of america lucio rodriguez in a statement after learning about the cnh announcements ecopetrol expressed its satisfaction with the result obtained and thanks its partners petronas and pemex for all the professional effort and trust that made this process possible the opinion juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol this achievement is part of the strategy to strengthen and diversify exploration and production activities abroadmoodys maintained investment grade and negative outlook on ecopetrol this was reported by the state oil company through relevant information from the financial superintendency where it highlighted that the international rating agency highlighted the favorable results of the transportation segment in recent years moodys highlighted that since  greater operating and capital efficiency combined with higher oil prices contributed to improving ecopetrols credit metrics and cash flow increasing its borrowing capacity and investment in new reserves said the company chaired by juan carlos echeverryagreement between cormagdalena and ecopetrol signed of the total amount   million will be destined for the dredging between barrancabermeja and pinillos in the current term cormagdalena will contribute   million while ecopetrol   million in relation to the remaining money   million will be provided by ecopetrol in order to guarantee resources for the new publicprivate association app of the magdalena river that will be published by cormagdalena next august and that has a value close to   billion according to the minister of transportation jorge eduardo rojas said agreement was signed seeking to round off the investment to be made in the magdalena river in all sectors this is a great investment and getting ecopetrol to collaborate with the magdalena river ppp and with dredging especially in the barrancabermeja and pinillos sectors in various departments is very important said the official the government through mintransporte cormagdalena and invias has taken actions to guarantee the navigability of the magdalena river and the maintenance of the access channel to the port of barranquilla it is important to remember that on june  the new executive director of cormagdalena will be elected currently luis fernando andrade is in chargemoodys reaffirmed ecopetrols investment grade rating this was reported by the state oil company through the financial superintendency where it highlighted that the international rating agency welcomed the favorable results of the transportation segment in recent years moodys highlighted that since  greater operating and capital efficiency combined with higher oil prices contributed to improving ecopetrols credit metrics and cash flow increasing its borrowing and investment capacity in new reserves indicated the company chaired by juan carlos echeverry for its part the rating agency fitch ratings improved the rating outlook of the countrys largest oil company on march  which went from negative to stable in addition it maintained its longterm risk rating for local and foreign currency at bbb according to the fitch ratings report the outlook improvement of ecopetrols rating was in line with the improvement to stable in colombias ratingcenit ecopetrol and oleoducto central with the highest profits in the sector in the top three of the companies with the most profits cenit transporte y logistica de hidrocarburos sas was ranked first with sales of   billion followed by ecopetrol with   billion and oleoducto central saocensa in third position with   billion it is striking that these companies are part of the same parent company however these figures are not so positive if one takes into account that the three companies saw a decrease in their profits compared to  in ecopetrol it was reduced  in ocensa  and in cenit  these numbers are a reflection of one of the most difficult years for the oil industry especially due to the fall in international prices that reached the lowest levels of the last  years with an average of us   per barrel that is  below the  price against this background companies sought to be more efficient reduced their operating costs and sought to be more selective when investing said francisco lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp in the conference call with ecopetrol investors luisa fernanda lafaurie president of cenit said for example that during  the total volume transported was reduced by  barrels per day bpd equivalent to  in comparison with  reaching  million barrels per day  in relation to the financial results of the transportation segment lafaurie described them as very positive mainly due to significant cost reductions in our operation and maintenance that allowed us to save approximately   million compared to  for his part the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry also pointed out that the commitment to efficiency was materialized in all business segments which also explains the companys best profit cumulative savings for the year amounted to   trillion exceeding the proposed goal for the year of   trillion echeverry said precisely german espinosa president of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol said that the greatest adjustments that companies in our sector see come mainly from the fall in investment by operating companies which are the primary source of investment activity of service companies  similarly espinosa added that operating companies reduce costs through the renegotiation of contracts with service companies which from his perspective although it generates results in the short term is not sustainable the top five of the companies with the most profits were closed by petrolatina energy with   billion and occidental andina with   million on the other hand among the companies with the most losses is reficar with a value of   billion lr asked reficar why and the company pointed out two aspects in relation to operations the refinery worked with all its units from july consequently it received a lower load of crude oil and had a lower conversion capacity for much of the year additionally the startup and stabilization of the units implied higher fixed costs  secondly from a financial point of view it was due to debt service and the depreciation associated with the first years of amortization of the investment in the project it is important to remember that oil reserves as of december   were  million barrels as reported by the national hydrocarbons agency anh which meant a  decrease compared to  the opinion of german espinosa president of campetrol operating companies reduce costs by renegotiating contracts with service companies which is not sustainable in the

decided to maintain the negative perspective of the oil company led by juan carlos echeverry similarly the firm added that in our opinion ecopetrol plays a very important role in colombia given its position as the largest company in the country ecopetrol has a significant presence in the oil and gas sector in colombia acts as the it is the main supplier of petroleum products in the domestic market and it has a very strong link with the government which has control of its property and performs strategic supervision despite the fact that the company has an independent management team  regarding the sacp issue the rating agency noted that ecopetrol reported better than expected key credit indicators particularly debt to ebitda however regarding the negative outlook sp argued that this has to do with colombias sovereign rating we expect ecopetrol to continue to play a very important role in the colombian economy and to maintain a very strong link with the government therefore we consider that ecopetrols ratings will most likely move in tandem with those of the sovereignecopetrol will prepay a loan it had abroad for us   million it should be noted that according to the company the original maturity date of said loan was agreed for february  this advance payment is the result of the companys solid cash position which by the end of the first quarter of  amounted more than us   million ecopetrol said in a statement in which he added that the solid cash position is the result of the efficiencies and savings achieved by the ecopetrol business group gee which from  to date add up to more than us   million  on the other hand the company highlighted that this advance payment is aligned with the objectives of the  business plan and confirms ecopetrols objective of continuing to improve its credit ratingecopetrol will create a supply center for offshore operations in barranquilla the state oil company ecopetrol which has been betting on increasing its offshore exploration will have a supply center and logistics activities in barranquilla which will serve the molusco well located in la guajira this will be the first offshore well that ecopetrol will operate directly and it will do so hand in hand with the indian oil company ongc according to el heraldo according to the executive vice president of the company felipe bayon exploration in this area would begin between september and october and would involve an investment of us   million the well is close to the chuchupa and ballena fields bayon who spoke with el heraldo also said that there will be another logistics center for anadarkos operations which would be added to repsols existing center in the atlantic capital according to the vice president this year investments of us   million will be made for exploratory activity which will be reflected in the work that will be developed in  wells counting five that will be done offshore the executive said that it is important to note that we explored five wells offshore this year and we have already had two successful ones purple angel and gorgon but it really is a risk business and we have to wait for the results the newspaper ended by

billion after two years of adjustments to weigh the oil crisis and an efficiency plan designed to protect cash and consolidate savings ecopetrol maintains its figures in the green because with the advance payment of us   million to international banks the the company reduced its total debt by  and consolidated savings of   billion last friday the oil company announced that after consolidating a cash close of   billion in the first semester it would make a prepayment of a loan to international banks this is due to the fact that according to a statement issued by the company they wanted to pay about   billion of the total debt that today reaches   billion for the corporate vice president of strategy and finance of ecopetrol maria fernanda suarez this transaction is due to the programmed savings that have been made for the last two years with this payment   billion in interest was canceled until  this is due to the efficiency plan that the directives proposed to improve production costs and encourage financial leverage according to the most recent study carried out by the woodmackenzie firm between  and  ecopetrol was the oil company with the greatest reduction in production costs since it lowered its expenses to  above chevron shell and exxonmobil faced with this suarez also assured that this payment will bring greater confidence to investors we have seen in this first semester that our debt indicators have been reduced and our production and cash capacity has increased the interesting thing at this point is the reduction in ebitda which dropped to  which translates into greater confidence with its investors  the contrasts maria fernanda suarez financial vice president of ecopetrol  with this payment   billion in interest was canceled until  this is due to the efficiency plan that the directives proposed to improve production costs regarding the growth of their operating income in recent years the company showed that after requiring a barrel for us   to receive profits with the efficiency plan it achieved that by the end of the first quarter its profits were maintained with barrels of up to us    the company found a precise expense adjustment and this generated a positive cash flow we see that its investment plan is focused on the exploration and reserves part because in the coming months the oil company will continue with this growth trend  said orlando santiago manager of fenix valor transaction benefits according to analysts the prepayment of the debt materializes short and longterm benefits camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones indicated that one of the benefits that can be appreciated will be the improvement in the credit rating and return on investment to shareholders this together with a better financial expense that will save the company between   million to   million  however despite the fact that the forecasts are good for the company santiago indicated that in the stock market the stock still remains between   and   because the company has not made public the final results of its latest investments  it is worth noting that although the two analysts have divided opinions they agree on a benefit lower financial expenses and higher profitability in their profits because according to silva and santiago in the coming months ecopetrol will have an increase in its shares which will reflect

foreigners that have not implemented exchange hedging mechanisms assured nicolas preciado foreign exchange and derivatives strategist at itau comisionista in the first place some of the companies that

of its resins abroad companies have learned to acquire hedges from both banks and stockbrokers to mitigate exchange risk said diego franco president of franco capital group likewise the rise in the dollar will affect to a greater extent those companies that within their financial structure have indebtedness abroad in this sense according to some analysts surveyed the strength of the north american currency could impact the bogota energy company eeb the exito group or the state ecopetrol whether due to commitments with financial entities or debt issues this group would be another of those affected by the increases in its payment commitments given the relationship of the obligations between the initially agreed rate and the current exchange rate preciado explained the contrasts

awarded for blocks  and  of the round   assured the companyin barrancabermeja the first forum on nonconventional reservoirs began with the support of ecopetrol the union sindical obrera and the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet the first forum of nonconventional oilfields a place of debate began in barrancabermeja one of the most important oil centers in colombia which will serve as a space to discuss alternative options for exploration and production projects in source rock deposits in magdalena medio as well as aspects related to its regulation and currently highly controversial methods such as fracking julio cesar vera president of acipet pointed out at the installation of the forum that colombia without being an oil country by nature must continue on the path of taking advantage of this source as a contribution to the colombian economy contributing with a responsible attitude for the benefit of all  the event will have the participation of german arce minister of mines and energy and juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol who will contribute their vision from the point of view of energy and economic selfsufficiency to exploit unconventional deposits some of the main sources of this type and which will be discussed at the event are shale gas gas associated with coal gas in cemented sandstones and oil shale among others and that have already been exploited in a real way in countries of the region such as argentina and who will talk about their experience at the eventunconventional fields could triple ecopetrols oil production in the first forum of nonconventional reservoirs that takes place in barrancabermeja santander juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol pointed out that in the magdalena medio area there is a potential between  and  million barrels of oil to be produced which it could triple or even quadruple total oil reserves which currently stand at  billion the people of the region and of colombia must be guaranteed that the exploration and exploitation of these types of sources will not compromise water resources that a drop of water for a barrel of oil will not compromise risks can be managed safely and effectively without unconventional sources it will be difficult to recharge reserves in barrancabermeja and reficar after   echeverry pointed out in this sense losing oil selfsufficiency is a worrying situation for colombia in the very near horizon in the medium term with great economic and social implications for the country explained julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet at the same time vera stressed that this type of space serves as a place for debate to clearly address an issue that in a short time will represent a problem of a national nature and not only regional in an oil zone like barrancabermeja in this type of deposits unconventional hydrocarbons such as shale gas oil shale gas associated with coal gas in cemented sandstones and gas hydrates stand out and that in other countries of the region such as argentina have multiplied by three the jobs related to this type of reservoirs in relation to conventional generationecopetrol goes for unconventional deposits in magdalena medio with a potential investment of between us   million and us   million in unconventional deposits in the middle magdalena valley this type of hydrocarbon represents the future of oil and gas reserves in colombia a situation that it has understood and that it seeks to take advantage of ecopetrol from now on juan carlos echeverry president of the company pointed out at the first forum on nonconventional reservoirs that at ecopetrol we are obsessively looking for reserves and in this sense unconventional reservoirs represent an opportunity since there are between  and  million barrels to produce in magdalena medio a figure that would quadruple the approximate  million today  these types of deposits include hydrocarbons such as shale gas oil shale gas associated with coal and gas hydrates where argentina is one of the regional benchmarks in south america for julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet these hydrocarbons are the way to achieve oil selfsufficiency and change a trend that in five years if not diversified will lead us to import oil with very serious consequences negative for all minminas issued new technical regulations for offshore exploration german arce minister of mines and energy issued and established this thursday a new technical regulation for companies engaged in drilling activities for exploratory wells seeking to determine the presence of hydrocarbons in deep waters in colombia with this new regulation we establish the technical criteria for offshore hydrocarbon drilling projects for which we incorporate the highest international standards to carry out offshore activities said deputy minister of energy rutty paola ortiz likewise he added that with this regulation we ensure the sustainable development of the industry respecting our seas and caring for marine biodiversity the exploration and exploitation of offshore hydrocarbons seeks to increase the hydrocarbon reserves at the national level and for this the ministry of commerce has approved in the last year four permanent offshore free zones in which investments of approximately us   million are foreseen and that they will have for example ecopetrols participation in exploratory activities at the molusco well in la guajiraanalysts expect the

that opec production would increase in july despite the cartels promises to reduce pumping in that sense with respect to the barrel of the wti reference experts suggest that this week it will maintain its downward trend and cost us   during the weekend the meeting of some members of the group will take place in russia where the message is expected to be a little more encouraging after on thursday the petrologistics company established that the july production for the group it would be the maximum of the year with an oil price close to us   us   per barrel the currency could once again head to

repercussions for the country taking into account that oil reserves have been falling and although echeverry assures that only through drilling will they know how much the productive capacity of the guamal field amounts to it is already estimated that it can give billions of barrels of original oil news that could cushion in the short term the low price crisis that is being experienced according to espitia and it is necessary since according to the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol it is urgent to join forces between the national government and the hydrocarbon industry to design and implement a crash plan that will ward off the loss of energy selfsufficiency with the drilling of  ecopetrol will also identify the potential of the entire area let us remember that the company has been present in the region for  years and operates in the municipalities of acacias castilla la nueva guamal aguazul tauramena and in villavicencio in addition the production of  kbpe thousands of barrels of oil equivalent in this region is equivalent to  of the entire country and  of ecopetrols total so far the oil block where the well is located produces  average barrels per day so finding great potential in the area would be decisive not only to increase field production but to counteract a possible depletion of reserves  the president of campetrol german espinosa assured that there is a precarious horizon of selfsufficiency of  years that deepened with the fall in oil prices but that is also due to unresolved structural factors in colombia such as the climate investment and legal stability campetrol asked for a crash plan to increase reserves this was stated by campetrol in the call for unity that it made to the industry the government and the territories to avoid the loss of energy selfsufficiency an affirmation that would be based on the fact that the industry represents even with the current situation of low prices  of exports  of the nations fiscal

months of the semester during the second quarter of  the cement companys sales reached us   million which represented a  drop compared to the same period in  as explained by the company itself it was due to lower cement volumes and prices likewise its net profit fell  compared to the previous year although the difficult outlook that is unfolding in colombia may end by the second half of the year

ecopetrol managed to confirm two hydrocarbon discoveries in the gulf of mexico this time on account of the discovery in  of which the company evaluates the potential volume according to company information the  well is operated by anadarko which has a  stake in the block while ecopetrol through its subsidiary ecopetrol america owns the other  in addition it is located in the green canyon area in the gulf of mexico united states  kilometers from the coast which means that the proximity to the production facilities of the marco polo platform will allow streamlining the processes of production which represents a clear competitive advantage  as reported by the company the drilling reached a depth of  feet  meters and a water depth of  feet  meters he also pointed out that the recovered hydrocarbon is light and analyzes are underway to determine its volume once the exploratory operation phase is concluded the development plan for this new discovery will be determined  for his part juan carlos echeverry president of the company highlighted that this second discovery in the gulf of mexico in the last eight months responds to the objective we have set ourselves to position ecopetrol as a panamerican company this good news confirms the success we are achieving with our strategy in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves he completedecopetrol has made four oil discoveries so far this year ecopetrols investments in the gulf of mexico amount to us   million a figure that would be rewarded not only with the most recent hydrocarbon discovery in  a well located in green canyon but with the other three discoveries they have had so far this year related article ecopetrol will begin drilling trogon   one of its most promising wells the well which is operated by anadarko with  of the block and ecopetrol america with  participation has light hydrocarbon reserves that are already being analyzed to determine its volume related article ecopetrol reported that cano limoncovenas has not operated for  days a finding that for juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol responds to the objective that we have set ourselves to position ecopetrol as a panamerican company and to the strategy they have to seek new hydrocarbon reserves according to max torres vice president of exploration for the oil company in the well a hydrocarbon column was found in a total depth of  meters below sea level with  of a column of water however the most interesting thing about the discovery is its strategic position since it is  kilometers from the  field where ecopetrol has a  stake and close to the marco polo platform that will receive production from this well it should be noted that only in the first quarter of this year ecopetrols production in this area increased by  with respect to the same period of the previous year going from  to  barrels per day so the companys expectation is keep growing with this new well the other three findings of the company in  have been purple angel located in the colombian caribbean with a  stake from anadarko the operating company  which has deepwater gas reserves in the southern caribbean and boranda located in the middle magdalena valley with medium crude in the esmeraldas formation for jairo agudelo economic research manager at valores bancolombia  was developed to confirm and define the capacity and size of the well and until we know the final results of the exploratory process it is difficult to know the impact this will have on ecopetrol  however the analyst sees positively that the company already assumes it as a successful exploration regardless of the size it may have for now it is known that it is light crude the most profitable and one of the least expensive to exploit so there are good expectations for the discovery of the oil companyoil production fell  in june according to the ministry of mines and energy as reported by the ministry of mines and energy the average crude production during june was  barrels per day which meant a decrease of  compared to the same month in  on that occasion it was  barrels for jorge bendeck president of fedebiocombustibles the explanation for this drop is mainly due to two incidents on the one hand there are the  blockades to the la cirainfantas field in barrancabermeja the one with the highest production of ecopetrol in the magdalena medio which reduced its production from  barrels per day to  related article attack against the cano limon covenas oil pipeline leaves a fourmeter crater in addition the continuous attacks there are  so far this year against the cano limon covenas oil pipeline located in arauca have it practically unproductive without the pipeline it is impossible to evacuate production bendeck said in fact according to ecopetrol the field has been paralyzed since may  likewise another factor that the manager mentioned was the natural decline of the fields however when comparing the june figure with the immediately previous month there was an increase of  according to minminas this was due to normalization in the la cirainfantas field the report also noted that the preliminary gas production figure stood at  million cubic feet per day which represented a fall of  compared to june  when it had been  million feet cubic according to the national hydrocarbons agency anh this figure is  lower than in may

ecopetrol made an urgent call to the authorities of the region so that they exercise their constitutional function and guarantee the rights of workers the integrity of people care for the environment environment and immediately restore public order the oil company has suffered a series of blockades and attacks on its infrastructure so far this year which has affected its operation and production some of the wells that have been affected throughout  are la cira infanta where damage to  wells was recorded last may in addition to the suspension last june of  wells in campo rubiales due to blockages of the alto unuma indigenous communityecopetrol increased its profit for the semester  and accumulates   billion in profits the colombian state oil company reported financial results for this second quarter which show that a profit attributable to its shareholders of   trillion was achieved which corresponds to an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year when the profits reached   million with this figure the accumulated earnings for the first semester totaled   billion which represents an increase of about  compared to  according to ecopetrol among other variables the result is due to the constant reduction in operating costs and expenses which has been implemented since  and accumulating savings of   million which represents  of the savings goal for the year of   million in terms of price a relief was also achieved which was represented by sales for the quarter which reached   billion according to the companys analysts the global shortage of heavy crude helped capture market opportunities in international sales the spread of ecopetrols export basket improved significantly reaching us   per barrel for the quarter meanwhile the ebitda margin remained solid at  one of the highest in the industry in fact felipe agudelo equity analyst at alianza valores emphasized the positive results during the second quarter of the year thanks to a higher average price of export oil as well as the production of efficient barrels the average value of the wti was us   when last year it was about us   and us   agudelo explained another key factor was the decrease in product imports due to the entry into operation of the cartagena refinery which in turn has achieved a total sales volume of  kbd at the end of the first semester of which  kbd correspond to national sales and the remaining  kbd to exports the time has come to build on this financial strength and discipline and to focus our efforts on ecopetrols profitable growth profitable growth is supported by four fundamental pillars i increased exploration activity ii development of improved recovery pilots and infill projects iii exploring opportunities in nonconventional reservoirs and iv progress in inorganic growth opportunities  assured the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry the ecopetrol groups production in the first semester was  barrels equivalent per day kboed which is located in the goal of  and with which it was possible to compensate for the losses caused by the lack of operation for almost  days of the cano limon covenas oil pipeline we have managed to maintain our production rate despite public order situations and operational events that have occurred the recovery pilot programs are progressing satisfactorily at the end of the year we will have four recovery pilots that will have completed the evaluation stage after a year of retaking the rubiales and cusiana fields we have managed to maintain a stable and safe operation an important operational achievement has been to sustain a stable operation with the bidirectionality of the bicentenario pipeline to evacuate crude from the cano limon field and thus mitigate to some extent the closure of the pipeline thanks to the bidirectionality in bicentenario we were able to do more maintenance on the cano limon pipeline without affecting production added echeverry in terms of exploration the reactivation of investments was achieved and as explained by the companies after the successes of purple  and  in the second quarter the drilling of siluro   was continued and the discovery of boranda likewise ecopetrol will continue its exploratory activity in the gulf of mexico united states where previous results from two operations were already obtained and on july  the drilling of the  well was completed which confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons and is under evaluation the results were above analysts projections who averaged   trillion in revenue and   billion in profit for the quarterecopetrols semiannual profits doubled those of the same period in  despite the more than  popular initiatives against the hydrocarbon sector the  attacks registered by illegal groups during the year in cano limon covenas and the blockade that for  days it stopped crude production at la cira infantas ecopetrol presented positive financial results for the first half of the year related article ecopetrol reported violent seizure at the chichimene station in the meta according to the financial superintendency the company reported   billion in profits almost double what was reported in the first half of the previous year when they reached   trillions during the quarter profits were   trillion recall that this figure in the same period of the previous year was   million which represented an increase of  compared to the second quarter of  this time the results even exceeded everything registered during  the margin ebitda for the semester remained at  throughout the year an equivalent of us   a barrel for juan carlos echeverry president of the company it is one of the highest in the industry given that it closed with a solid cash position of   billion dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter on  earnings reached   million and as echeverry states a loan with international commercial banking for us   million approximately   billion was prepaid related article ecopetrol has made four oil discoveries so far this year in the case of nominal debt it decreased  during the second quarter of  this has motivated the risk rating agencies to recognize ecopetrols achievements  confirming its investment grade credit rating as assured by echeverry in addition sp improved the companys standalone rating from bb to bb  for felipe agudelo equity analyst at alianza valores these positive results for the second quarter of the year are due to a higher average price of crude oil as well as the production of efficient barrels the average value of the wti was us   when last year it was about us   and us   agudelo explained in fact for alianza valores the bet was that the profits were between  and  higher than those of the same period of  that is for a value of   million overall the most likely scenario was in excess of   trillion in operating profit and   trillion in total revenue daniel escobar director of economic research at global securities assured that the projections were for   billion in total sales the operating profit at   billion and the profits at   million however the results were superior something that could also be motivated by the good figures from the exploratory campaign the contrasts juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol we have managed to maintain our production rate despite public order situations and operational events that have occurred jorge bendeck president of fedebiocombustibles the good results of ecopetrol can respond to the policy of efficient barrels and an excellent management of the company in a time of crisis with the start of exploration in  the presence of light crude was detected the second discovery in that area in the last eight months the good sales results could respond to better differentials in the basket of exported crude prices against brent the increase in international oil prices compared to the previous year and the lower import of products due to the entry into operation of the cartagena refinery  as stated in the companys report the groups total sales reached  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped during the first half of the year a  drop compared to the same period of the previous year local crude oil sales meanwhile grew  with a figure of  boed while exports were  barrels and fell  the colombian market for ecopetrol represented  of sales this represented semester sales of   billion  more than in the first half of last year despite the fact that there was a decrease in the average exchange rate of the income received which went from   per dollar between january and june  at   per dollar for this year which implied an impact on total revenues of   millionplease let ecopetrol return to its jurisdiction the novel about the impact of the oil sector on the economy is in its fourth season since  when the government began to feel the blow to its finances of ecopetrols poor results the authorities discourse has been to tighten their belts and to deny which is already evident a dutch disease that displaced all the bills the figures show that the state oil company reduced its contribution to government revenues from the   billion in  to the   it delivered in  the big blow occurred between  and  years in which ecopetrol contributed   trillion and   million respectively the curious thing is that despite the fact that year after year the price of a barrel of oil was falling the accounts of the ministry of finance remained optimistic a detailed review of the mediumterm fiscal framework of these years shows how the state was ruled out with its projections for  it expected   billion in capital income from ecopetrol and in reality it obtained   billion and so on in every year ignoring a reality that was latent but the good thing is that ecopetrol has taken the positive rhythm again and although its profits no longer reach the billions of before it did close a first quarter with profits of   million and a second quarter at   billion which leads to close the first semester with profits of   trillion that is a growth of  compared to the same period in  the optimistic results came thanks to four pillars that its president juan carlos echeverry explains as i an increase in the exploratory activity ii development of improved recovery pilots and infill projects iii exploring opportunities in nonconventional reservoirs and iv progress in inorganic growth opportunities  now the focus is on the variable that causes the most uncertainty and on which it depends on whether ecopetrol will return to or come close to what it was four years ago the price of oil the barrel of reference both brent used by the government and that of wti has had an irregular year with prices between us   and us   a figure that although favorable for the oil company is not enough to deliver the profits that it previously left for what the cost reduction that has been implemented in the course of the year has been of great help the government makes accounts with a brent price of us   for this year and for the next of us   with that projection was that he prepared the general budget of the national  also calculates that the oil revenues for next year will be  of gdp and will only rise to  between  and  very low values compared to  of the gdp that it generated in  when it had the highest level since  under this scenario it is necessary for ecopetrol to take its jurisdiction again and provide the government with financial stability that will get it out of trouble increasing profits will not be enough but it will have to make reficar an industry that grows that does not sleep like the other economic sectors and continues to consolidate negative data in production in addition you will have to put your face in legal research issues and make your subsidiaries the most efficient companies in what they do demonstrate why they are categorized as an example companyminhacienda set a goal of   billion in profits for ecopetrol in  related article ecopetrols semiannual profits doubled those of the same period in  regarding ecopetrols results presented yesterday in which profits for the first semester were at   billion the minister of finance mauricio cardenas stressed that it is positive news it allows us to think that by the end of the year we may be caressing a figure close to   billion that is the goal that i have set for myself and i have raised with the ecopetrol administration said the minister likewise cardenas pointed out that if these good results continue in  both the government and the colombian shareholders around  could once again receive important dividends it is important to remember that this year they received   dividends per sharethe production goal for

president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry highlighted that these reinforce the bases for a profitable growth path the production goal for the year remains stable at  average barrels of oil equivalent per day the exploratory campaign in the second quarter seeks to expand the portfolio of assets and continue adding contingent resources said echeverry likewise he emphasized that the company will continue to challenge itself to identify the best projects that leverage growth and that are executed on time budget and quality for that purpose the project maturity center was created felipe bayon executive vice president also celebrated the results of the first semester we made the transition from the period of managing the price crisis to the period of growth in production and reserves he said in the same way he pointed out as three challenges that ecopetrol faced in the semester some problems in the reficars alkylation and hidrocracking plants which are already in operation bioenergy and cano limon which has been the victim of several attacks the minister of finance mauricio cardenas highlighted the positive figures and said that they allowed us to think that by the end of the year profits could be close to   billion that is the goal that i have set for myself and i have set to the ecopetrol administration he saidecopetrol contracted a loan with bancolombia for   million in order to strengthen its position in the face of future growth opportunities or unexpected fluctuations in oil prices ecopetrol contracted a loan with bancolombia for

an interest rate of ibr plus  basis points and a commission of    basis points per year over the period of availability under this type of credit bancolombia sa undertakes to disburse the resources

ecopetrols semiannual profits doubled those of the same period in  the debt strategy allows reducing the cost of borrowing while maintaining financial flexibility for growth this point was fundamental to achieve the increase in the quarterly and semiannual results of this year which showed a  increase in profitsecopetrol denounced acts of vandalism at its facilities in acacias meta ecopetrol denounced that in the last hours sabotage and vandalism against workers contractors and the infrastructure of the company in acacias have worsened according to the company a group of  hooded men entered tower  of the independence company located in the castilla field forced the workers to leave damaged the equipment controls and threw bottles full of gasoline at the facility this violent action put the integrity of the people who were working in the place at risk as it caused a fire that could cause a large explosion ecopetrol said in a statement likewise it pointed out that the acts of sabotage extended to another maintenance team tower  operating in the chichimene field as well as to nine production wells which generated oil spills that were controlled by the emergency plan of the company added to this was the blocking of roads and the retention and damage of contractor companies vehicles ecopetrol reiterated its rejection of this type of action locks complete  daysin  years ecopetrol expects  of its production to be gas bogota_ we must be more and more gas as stated by juan carlos echeverry president of ecopetrol in the talk ecopetrol  reserve growth strategy which was held at the facilities of the national university the manager explained that today the companys production is  oil and  gas so in its diversification strategy one of the goals is to be  oil and  gas in  if you look at shell exxon or chevron in general there are  and  gas is a different difficult and interesting business in the world we are going to use more gas and less oil said echeverry for alejandro martinez president of the union of colombian propane gas companies gasnova it is a good idea for the company to set itself this goal because both natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas lpg are less polluting to achieve this martinez emphasized that the company can focus on exploration activities in search of gas fields probably in the caribbean sea there is a greater option or buy already discovered reserves precisely the purchase of reserves offshore exploration in both the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico the injection of improved recovery energy and unconventional reservoirs are the four aspects that make up ecopetrols reserve growth strategy between now and  as explained by julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet  in its diversification plan ecopetrol is not only betting on gas produced from offshore but also on nonconventional ones it is important to continue developing the whole issue of offshore and of course to enter the unconventional where in addition to liquid there will be gas said vera what are unconventionals or bedrock deposits as vera explained they are those that do not have natural permeability but have to be generated artificially for example through hydraulic stimulation better known as fracking the potential in unconventional reservoirs is  million barrels which would mean that the country would not have five years but  years of selfsufficiency and an additional potential between  and  barrels per day said the engineer in fact according to preliminary calculations echeverry explained that if the price of a barrel were at us   it could be possible in  years to produce from  to  unconventional barrels and if it reached for example us   to  only in the magdalena medium where there is a potential between  billion and  billion barrels of crude oil and  gas therapies other aspects contemplated by the diversification of ecopetrol to  are to increase the production of medium and light crude from  its current value to  as well as reducing the heavy from  to  similarly it estimates that its production comes in  from the americas currently it is  and the rest from colombia reficars sales increased  with a cut to the first half of the year the cartagena refinery reficar recorded sales of us   million which meant an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year when it was us   millions this corresponded to sales of  million barrels of fuel of the sales so far in  more than  million barrels were diesel  million gasoline  million jets  million gasoline and more than one million lpg among other products local sales represented us   millioncanacol ecopetrol and isa the companies that grew the most in revenues until june in the framework of a first semester marked by the economic slowdown where growth stood at  between january and march and when the second quarter is expected to close with a gdp rising  to date  large companies have delivered the report of their operational and financial performance a list that due to revenue growth is led by the energy mining sector with canacol ecopetrol and isa in the first place was canacol whose income grew  in the first semester compared to the same period of  which allowed it to close with   million in sales a figure that according to its president charle gamba was driven by progress achieved in the gas business and the consolidation in exploration achieved with the acquisition of  of the former pacific contract in magdalena despite the results obtained in income the consolidated to june showed that profits fell  so that its profits only totaled   million canacol was joined by the state oil company ecopetrol which surprised this semester with a  increase in profits earning   billion in the first six months while reporting revenues of   billion with a growth of  according to the company the results respond to the constant reduction of costs and expenses the operating and financial performance of the semester was outstanding this is how juan carlos echeverry president of the oil company described the results obtained adding that during the last two years the company has embarked on a profound transformation that has led it to have indicators that place it at the top of the ranking global industry the podium was completed by isa because at the end of june both the companys income and profits left positive balances the first indicator grew  and allowed the energy company to close with   trillion while the second increased  and left profits of   million in six months the contrasts juan carlos mora president of bancolombia the gross portfolio rose  compared to  a favorable figure considering that in the second quarter we lowered interest rates as a boost to domestic consumption carlos ignacio gallego chairman of grupo nutresa the best month was june and july continues with a similar more positive trend we see the quarter with positive eyes because it prepares us for the second half of the year  in this regard juan carlos mora president of the bank indicated that we achieved an  growth in profits compared to the same period last year in addition the gross portfolio rose  in relation to  an assessable figure considering that this second quarter we decided to lower the interest rates on housing loans credit cards and vehicle loans as a boost to reactivation of domestic consumption  henkel bvc and tecnoglass completed the group of seven companies that managed to have an increase in their income despite the contraction of the economy henkel which reported its global results grew  and reached   billion the bvc closed with   million and a growth of  and tecnoglass gained  more in this semester closing with   million in revenues however other companies such as fabricato cementos argos and enka could not avoid the economic difficulties and presented the biggest drops in profits juan esteban calle president of cementos argos pointed out that the good results obtained in the united states and in the caribbean and central america largely offset the challenges we are facing in the colombian market these challenges led cemargos to close in the red because despite achieving revenues of   billion this indicator had a fall of  and its profits fell  leaving only   billion still calle said he expects a better second half in the local market similarly enkas revenues fell  to ch   million and its profits fell  to ch   million however businessmen have been optimistic about what is missing to close ecopetrol is betting on unconventional deposits to increase its reserves the oil company ecopetrol will focus its exploration efforts in the coming years on unconventional fields in central and northern colombia an area with a high potential for light crude as part of its strategy to increase its reserves announced the president of the company  parallel to the search for oil in unconventional fields ecopetrol will continue to develop its mature fields to increase recovery offshore exploration in the colombian caribbean the united states mexico and brazil in addition to the search for companies for possible purchases the unconventional exploration work will take place in the magdalena medio an area where the la luna and tablazo geological formations converge which according to experts could have  million barrels of original oil in place revealed the president of ecopetrol juan carlos echeverry in a recent interview with reuters there we have an area  kilometers long by about  kilometers wide it is a slightly oval formation it is the same la luna formation that comes from the gulf of maracaibo and a tablazo formation said echeverry revealing that experts calculate that the recoverable oil would be between  and  million barrels until we drill we will not really know what the delimitation is and what the potential is but apparently after the united states and vaca muerta in argentina our unconventional play seems to be the most substantial in terms of oil in the western hemisphere  he claimed unconventional reservoirs are rock formations that contain hydrocarbons in geological conditions that do not allow the movement of the fluid which makes it difficult to extract crude oil with techniques such as fracking that require high investments interest from companies with experience at the end of  ecopetrols reserves stood at  million barrels of oil equivalent a figure that represents  years of consumption echeverry assured that the search for unconventional deposits in which companies such as occidental and shell are also interested should be the most important country project of the next decade for colombia because in addition to increasing its reserves it would generate thousands of jobs and wealth this is the largest country project of the next decade we are going to take time but if we have the north for sure we will go for those reserves we are not experts in unconventionals and we would look for partners that they know said the  economist before he was minister of finance the official said ecopetrol has high expectations of entering mexico after it won two blocks to explore and produce hydrocarbons in shallow waters in june in association with petronas and pemex ecopetrol produces more than  of colombias oil and has a presence in brazil peru and the united states gulf of mexico and mexico the company owns the two main refineries in colombia and most of the network of oil pipelines and multiple pipelines in the south american country echeverry ruled out a share issue in the immediate future so that ecopetrol could obtain resources for its expansion  of the company is owned by the state and the remaining  is in the hands of private investors we do not consider equity issuance in the short term he concluded highlighting the companys good cash position of us   million at the close of the first half of ecopetrol accelerates expansion and will have a new subsidiary in mexico city related article propilco may be the base of an interesting petrochemical company juan carlos echeverry

felipe bayon pardo is a mechanical engineer from the universidad de los andes and has more than  years of experience in the oil and gas industry both in colombia and abroad for more than  years he worked at bp plc where he was senior vice president of bp americas and international director of deepwater response it also faced one of the biggest crises of that company which was the largest oil spill in the world with the macondo well therefore they point out that he is an expert in crisis management and offshore exploration when i arrived it was the appropriate position because it was financial and the box needed to be accommodated for the oil price crisis today the situation is different because what is needed is growth in reserves and production and felipes profile is the appropriate one for this point said the outgoing president in dialogue with la w radio since february  bayon has led ecopetrols operations as executive vice president which is why the board of directors asked him to continue with the transformation process and profitable focus that echeverry advanced the new president had been considered to run the oil company and was one of five

cash position we have just prepaid credits for   billion and we still have   billion he said so bayon will have to be in charge of maturing the assets to deploy that capital as well as buying reserves

crisis has an incredible wealth of hydrocarbons in addition there is the plan to participate in rounds in brazil where they have some frontera exploration blocks in this country they have spoken with the stateowned petrobras with which they will seek to be an ally on the onshore on the other hand the operating strategy in argentina could be consolidated where the oil company has already been talking with ypf to exchange assets on the other hand there is the task of continuing to consolidate operating results and strengthen the four strategies they have to grow more energy to traditional deposits also offshore exploration and asset purchases added to this is operational efficiency and avoiding fluctuations in the share price that have always been linked to the price of oil how does echeverry deliver the oil company echeverry says goodbye to the state oil company with positive results compared to previous years during the first semester of this year the company registered profits of   billion which represent an increase of  compared to  that is to say it almost doubled the earnings compared to the same period last year according to company information these results were due to the constant reduction in operating costs and expenses which has been implemented since  and accumulating savings of   million which represents  of the savings goal for the year of   million  only during the second quarter profits were   trillion in the same period of the previous year this figure was   million which represented an increase of  compared to the second quarter of  in terms of sales during the first half of the year they reached     billion which meant a growth of  and in the second quarter they were   billion these results were above analysts projections who averaged   trillion in revenue and   billion in profits for the quarter how did you receive the oil company echeverry received a company that at the end of  delivered negative financial results with a  drop in net profits compared to what was reported in  with a total of   billion in addition it had to face a reality with low oil prices that caused fixed costs to rise  which in turn impacted on total sales

management and oilcompanies that help take care of species that are on the way to extinction in the colombian territory  species are threatened in different categories as announced by the directorate of forests biodiversity and ecosystem services of the ministry of environment and sustainable development taking into account the criteria of the international union for conservation of nature iucn of the total of these species  are in critical danger  in danger and  species in vulnerable category it is worth noting that of these species  are animals and  are plants that is why different companies government entities and foundations are betting on programs to conserve these species in different areas of the country this is the case of grupo argos which since  through its foundation argos and celsia in a publicprivate alliance between national natural parks of colombia wildlife conservation society colombia the smurfit foundation and the valle del cauca autonomous corporation has been working on the conservamos la vida project which ensures the protection and conservation of the andean bear in the western cordillera for its part ecopetrol a firm that has adopted the iguana as its image has developed a program for the protection of this species which due to its type of meat and eggs is highly desired by hunters while drummond ltd carries out ongoing training campaigns for its collaborators about the importance of conserving wild fauna and flora thus demonstrating its commitment to the preservation of the ecosystems involved among the main threats that have been affecting these species both wild flora and fauna is illegal trafficking the introduction of exotic species the expansion of the agricultural frontier the transformation and fragmentation of habitats and climate change the threat to the species is a consequence of development processes that have not been well planned and have destroyed their habitats colombia was a blanket of forests one or two centuries ago and those forests have been wiped out to give way to economic activities that have been devastating ecosystems  said martha lucia palacios penaranda teacher and researcher at the faculty of basic sciences of the autonomous university of the west for her part rosamira guillen executive director of the fundacion proyecto titi said that there are two peculiarities with the species of the whiteheaded titi and that is that it only inhabits a piece of the colombian caribbean its historical distribution area is very restricted and it is not known seen nowhere else in colombia therefore they are more vulnerable to extinction processes the main threat of the titi is the loss of forest and that they are hunted to keep them as pets therefore we are focusing our work on reducing these threats and guaranteeing greater opportunities so that the species does not become extinct and we do so from four perspectives one it is scientific research the protection of the forest and the creation of protected areas the other two lines are of a social nature where we educate on conservation issues  added guillen the contrasts martha lucia palacios researcher u autonoma de occidente the threat to species is the consequence of development processes that have not been well planned and have destroyed their habitats rosamira guillen executive director of the titi project foundation the main threat of the whiteheaded titi is the loss of forest and that they are hunted by many people to keep them as pets according to information from the monitoring and research team of the national natural parks of colombia the countrys largest initiative for the conservation of fauna and flora is the declaration of a protected area not only national but also regional or local represented in national parks or civil society reserves in the case of national natural parks of colombia one of the main strategies is the monitoring of species an essential tool that allows to identify the species found in the protected areas know their status and collect associated information a constant activity is prevention surveillance and control in parks officials within the framework of the exercise of environmental authority deploy actions associated with mitigating preventing correcting and intervening pressures that may generate damagesthe market reacted positively to the change of command at the

very important management at the head of ecopetrol and has been a great ally of the association in the task of promoting the development of the sector in colombia said francisco jose lloreda executive president of the acp who added on the appointment that we are pleased with the decision to appoint felipe bayon to this position and we are convinced that we will continue working with him and the company as we have done in the pasthere there will be oil for a long time juan carlos echeverry although juan carlos echeverry had been considering his resignation for a few months it was until this wednesday that his departure was made official after  months at the helm of the largest oil company in the country when making his resignation public echeverry explained that he is leaving the company for family reasons and acknowledged being happy to have gone through the oil company regarding the companys balance sheet echeverry highlighted the growth and strengthening in these years such as the reactivation of the wells which declined during low oil prices in addition to an increase in production which is currently  barrels per day we surpassed the toughest crisis in decades in six months we had the profits of  we have four exploratory wells out of five that we drilled we propagated   billion and the financial metrics of the company are solid were echeverrys first words likewise the current president of the oil company who will be relieved on september  by the current executive vice president felipe bayon assured that we are going to grow in reserves and production and we have a renewed management group which tells the country to its owners who are colombians there will be oil here for a long time  on his departure echeverry explained that it was a family situation due to the appointment of his wife in the international finance corporation of the world bank so he will move with his family i had thought about the decision to move between bogota and washington but ecopetrol needs the person in charge to be  dedicated to this and we discuss it with the board and we prefer to make the transition sooner rather than later he said regarding the companys balance sheet echeverry highlighted the growth and strengthening in these years such as the reactivation of the wells which declined during low oil prices in addition to an increase in production which is currently  barrels per daythe ecopetrol that juan carlos echeverry leaves to the new president felipe bayon international oil prices peaked in late  when a barrel of wti cost us   a barrel the impact on oil companies around the planet was gigantic and ecopetrol was no exception dragging a drop in revenues and still high costs the crisis continued until the beginning of  when there was hardly a recovery in prices the blow for the state oil company was evident it went from having profits of   billion in  to showing a loss of   billion in  with reduced investment and shutdown wells this was the company that juan carlos echeverry began to direct at the time that he himself described as skinny cows with distrust of the market without dividends for its investors and a strong reduction in the income that came to the nation due to profits and taxes when announcing his resignation from the presidency of the state oil company echeverry acknowledged that we have overcome the toughest price crisis in decades and left optimism in the company with great challenges for his successor the current executive vice president felipe bayon one of the first tasks that bayon assumed and that bayon will have to continue is reducing costs optimizing contracts and making each barrel produced more efficient a fact that is manifested in the profits that it gave in the first half of this year     trillion higher than the total profits of    trillion francisco lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp indicated that echeverry had a moment of adjustment within the company and those adjustments are not easy and he added that the former minister did what he was supposed to do and he did it successfully delivers a company giving important profits for the country  these gains have been recorded thanks to the austerity strategy imposed by the president the company has managed to save about   billion annually achieving the goal of four years in just two being another of the goals that bayon must continue when he assumes the reins of ecopetrol echeverry who will be president of the company until september  explained that before the crisis we needed a barrel between us   and us   to produce profits today we need about us    which translates into a reduction of almost  in costs so a price of us   per barrel gives the company space to report profits hand in hand with these achievements came a third the creation of the vice presidencies of ethics and compliance and engineering and projects in addition to the founding of the project maturity center which will be in charge of the investments made by ecopetrol with an availability of   billion whats coming for bayon under this new administrative policy bayon will have to deal with echeverrys last great message and perhaps the most important which has to do with increasing reserves with a replacement goal of  that is  million barrels a year with successful contingent reserves thanks to the discoveries today there are  million barrels which for echeverry is not an astronomical figure for a company like ecopetrol which should aspire to  million barrels of reserve to achieve growth in this area there is a fundamental basis in its plans and it is the work on unconventional deposits an issue in which the company has made progress and is now assumed within the growth plan hand in hand with the recovery improved the contrasts francisco lloreda president of the acp we are pleased with the decision to appoint felipe bayon and we are convinced that we will continue working with him and the company alejandro martinez president of gasnova echeverrys departure is unfortunate he came with an important job and the company requires its executives to last longer  gasnovas president alejandro martinez acknowledged that strategy is important and that focusing on businesses that could generate greater materiality for the company such as offshore and nonconventional ones is very sensible it is the mentality of the big oil companies  to ensure that these discoveries bring growth to the state oil company bayon must continue with the capital discipline that was embraced in the last two years as well as strengthen the marketing and logistics strategy with which there is maximization of the value obtained by the crude colombians that work is already being done as echeverry revealed the company previously sold crude at a price of brent minus us   and now it is selling brent minus us   the factors for this are a little luck and a little work the luck is that the competition from heavy crude sells less such as venezuela or mexico in addition to the importation of colombian crude by the houston refineries  there is also an approach to refiners and a better corporate strategy this strategy was consolidated and will be key for the coming years with a renewal of up to  of the management group with people with experience in the largest oil companies in the world such as bp chevron and shell among others even the new president of the company is one of those experienced officials he is a mechanical engineer from the universidad de los andes has more than  years of experience in the industry former regional president of bp for the southern cone of south america and former director of exploration and production of the same firm in fact the relationship with these key companies in other countries is a fundamental part of ecopetrols strengthening plans in order to make it a panamerican company as echeverry hopes this has already been done especially with some firms such as anadarko petrobras oxy pemex and petrobas in offshore exploratory work and the onshore recognition of ecopetrol which has led the oil company to partner in mexico and participate in future rounds on land in brazil in addition to offshore partnerships in the caribbean investments and new projects in addition to ecopetrols fundamental work which is oil inorganic development is still a priority that is the purchase of shares and assets as investment echeverry has said that the company always buys and sells assets that allow it to adjust its portfolio such as the sale of the shares of empresa de energia de bogota now geb and empresa de telecomunicaciones de bogota etb those assets left him us   million last year with which we went to buy more appropriate assets for ecopetrol an activity in which the company will not stop working with the new presidency thanks to the solid cash position that allowed him for example to prepay debt for   billion at the same time the business group must continue with the development of its other companies such as reficar and bioenergy whose works are being investigated in the case of the cartagena refinery the main engine of colombian industry today it is loading  barrels a day while bioenergy already produces continuous ethanol to reach its maximum capacity of  liters per day echeverry pointed out that the promise of value from these companies should be in one or two years while other companies such as propilco will be valuable to ecopetrol de bayon when the gas discoveries are developed the challenge of the communities the echeverry administration left a good relationship with two groups a situation that bayon can take advantage of to speed up some projects in the territories the first is the relationship with the union sindical obrera uso with which there is fluid dialogue today according to echeverry the other group is that of the communities with whom despite resistance due to extractive activity in some areas ecopetrol enjoys a name and support a point in favor of the new president what are the investigations another thing that the still president of the oil company had to face are the criminal fiscal and disciplinary investigations for the cost overruns at reficar and bioenergy which will continue under the new administration juan carlos echeverry affirmed in inside lr the will of the company to accompany and support the actions of the control entities the last action that was made was the free version at the office of the comptroller general of the republic within the process carried out by the cartagena refinerythe iguana changes boss there is an informative exercise that bothers the most orthodox but that consumers of business economic and financial information like this is used by journalists to explain situations compare sizes and make understand the true dimension of the figures if ecopetrol were a colombian department in the economic sphere it would be the size of cundinamarca it is a company that has annual revenues of   billion its equity is   billion and its stock market value of   billion figures higher than the gdp of departments such as atlantico boyaca meta among others and if we made a list of departments for their contributions to the national gdp it would be in fifth place after bogota antioquia valle and santander all of the above to exemplify the true importance of this multilatina colombian joint venture which is not only the most powerful local company but is also among the  largest companies in the world according to forbes the news of the retirement of the presidency of the former minister juan carlos echeverry did not surprise the market because it was an open secret that his term was coming to an end what is new in the relevant matter is that his replacement will be one of his closest collaborators in such a way that the company will not be subjected to long times of uncertainty and political rattles with a hidden agenda echeverry came to the company without much experience in senior positions in the private sector and even less in the complex oil sector but he managed to overcome the problems that arose from low oil prices an objective he achieved by reducing costs and turning the company to the culture of efficiency he changed  of his senior management to people with experience in the best oil companies in the world in such a way that todays executives do not have political bosses but owe their position to their experience and training the greatest success of echeverry or the great inheritance are the savings that the company makes today valued at   billion annually that left many faces of resentment among the regional politicians who had made ecopetrol their minor cash today the company has two megaprojects operating as independent companies reficar and bioenergy a couple of companies that today are not only fundamental for the local industry but the real plan for the companys growth for the next decade added to this pair of industrial props is the successful reversal of rubiales and cusiana two residual fields that operate more than  barrels per day on the social front the new ecopetrol works on the new proposal of shared prosperity with the communities where it operates and has forged new strategic relationships with companies such as anadarko petrobras oxy and pemex the mixed multilatina is no longer what it was before for the colombian economy but it continues to be the goose that lays the golden eggs not only in transfers for the nation but also for the regions that still see in oil a vocation that it generates prosperity the company represented by an iguana that today is listed in new york and bogota has the challenge of not going back to the old days when everyone believed it was to loot it the former mismanagement of the company made the oil bonanza in colombia not felt as in other countries here the bonanza passed and nothing leftoil production rose

american energy strategymines and energy grows and construction companies fall in sales in the first half when reviewing the balance by sectors of the  companies that have reported their operating results to the financial superintendency omitting banks and the stock market it is the mining companies that so far present the best results while the construction sector companies have the best results more negative variations in your reports the report includes  companies divided into five sectors as follows construction food and drinks mines and energy and other companies in the real sector and although it is premature to analyze which sector fared better in a fairly heterogeneous balance of results the report already reveals some peculiarities entrepreneurs have openly said that this first semester of the year was difficult and the results were joined by several conjunctural situations among which appear the low index of consumer confidence the fall in domestic demand and the loss of the colombian peso against other currencies a a phenomenon that has advanced since  even so businessmen are optimistic about the end of the year regarding the fall in the sector the president of the construction company conconcreto juan luis aristizabal explained that in the first semester the fall in income was related to the displacement in large projects and in  which caused a negative cash in profits however he assured that this is a temporary issue and we expect the economy to start to rebound if not at the end of the year at least at the beginning of the next for her part silvana habib president of the national mining agency indicated that the entity is very optimistic with the reactivation of prices and the sector our mining potential is increasingly attractive to investors so the task of promotion this year is key to the growth of the sector and the country for which he added that  may bring historical figures for the mining issue construction sector failed to add to date there are two cement companies and one construction company that have presented their operating results for the first semester a balance that leaves negative variations in both income and profits and although the earnings of cementos argos fell  leaving a balance of   billion the company led by juan esteban calle leads the list of the sector in terms of income because despite falling  the figure at the end of june it totaled   billion this being the best result for its part cemex latam holdings had the largest drop in revenues with  less so that their revenues totaled   billion in this period even so the company stood out for its profit results with the highest figure in the sector   million the construction company conconcreto meanwhile presented a  decrease in revenues and  in profits however compared to the cement companies involved in the sector these were the lowest drops food did not grow due to low consumption when reviewing the reports of nutresa alpina and colombina companies in the food and beverage sector there is no doubt that in the first half of the year their biggest obstacle was the drop in demand in the local market therefore in a group that presented slight declines in income the work of nutresa stood out because in a difficult semester the company managed by carlos ignacio gallego managed to have revenues of   billion and its profits totaled   million with growth of  alpina meanwhile is the only company in the sector that managed to advance in sales with a slight increase of  however its profits fell  to   million the company was the most affected by factors such as the closing of markets due to the footandmouth disease alert the increase in the costs of dairy raw materials and high inventories the results of the colombina confectionery did not show a major change since its income fell  and totaled   billion mining companies increased their profits although only grupo mineros and gran colombia gold have submitted their semiannual reports to the financial superintendence the balance of the sector for now is positive and is related to the price of mineral especially that of coal the sector is the only one in which the group of companies presents a growth in their income as of june the balance sheet highlights the amount of grupo mineros income which led by andres restrepo closed with   million and a growth of  while its profits showed a slight fall of  leaving the company   millions the results of gran colombia gold also stand out since it managed to increase its income by  and close the semester with   million while increasing its profits by an exponential percentage of  which allowed it to obtain   million  the figure is the result of its improvement in the second quarter when it obtained profits of   million the contrasts silvana habib daza president of the national mining agency with the reactivation of prices and the sector our mining potential is becoming more attractive for investors energy added   billion in revenue the sector in which the most companies have reported is indisputably energy where six companies show an ambivalent performance with a sum in revenue of   billion but some variations in the red ecopetrol isa frontera energy celsia epsa and canacol are the ones that have shown their results in a list that leaves three companies with growth in income and three with fall in this group the performance of ecopetrol stands out under the presidency of juan carlos echeverry who will hand over his position to felipe bayon on september  a  growth left the oil company in the first place with revenues of   billion but it was joined by isa which grew  and reached   billion and canacol with an increase of  and revenues of   million in the list of those that decreased

mario giraldo marked this figure by reporting revenues of   billion ranking only above ecopetrol in the general ranking however two large holding companies occupied the following places grupo sura did the same with revenues of   billion a growth of  and the highest profit record of the whole   million while grupo argos had a growth of  and stood out with a figure of   billion in revenue despite

potential investment of between us   million and us   million in deposits unconventional in the magdalena medio valley this type of hydrocarbons represent the future of the gas and oil reserves in colombia a situation that will mark the longterm future of the mining and energy sector these types of deposits include hydrocarbons such as shale gas oil shale gas associated with coal and gas hydrates and where argentina is one of the regional benchmarks in the south america for this reason ecopetrol has found it opportune to explore unconventional deposits that represent an opportunity for the future energy mining industry since there are between  and  million barrels to be produced in magdalena medio a figure that would quadruple the approximate  million currently  according to

takes office next friday september  felipe bayon will assume as the  president of ecopetrol one of the characteristics of this position in the  history of the company has been its short duration since on average a president lasts two years in order not to go any further juan carlos echeverry was between april  and september  however perhaps in recent history the name of javier gutierrez pemberthy who was president of the company between january  and march  gutierrez was precisely the second longestlasting leader at ecopetrol eight years first place went to mario galan gomez who was in charge of the company for  years from  to  under the presidencies of guillermo leon valencia carlos lleras restrepo and misael pastrana borrero according to juan benavides current associate researcher at fedesarrollo and who wrote an article about the presidents of ecopetrol in the book that commemorated its  history during the time that galan was in office major internal restructuring took place and the company expanded in regional and business coverage beyond the traditional oil regions of santander and norte de santander  in addition he was the sixth leader of the oil company regarding javier gutierrez alejandro martinez president of gasnova assured that his management took ecopetrol from a company with a state vision to a modern one with a business vision it internationalized it and focused on managing environmental challenges particularly those of a social and environmental nature  the third who lasted the longest was isaac yanovich as he was in charge for five years alvaro uribes first presidency and the beginning of his second term and he was the one who led the sector reform that created the national hydrocarbons agency anh as regulator from the market in reviewing the companys history juan benavides found two other aspects that characterized the presidents of ecopetrol first eight were from santander and ran the company for  years and second most of the presidents graduated in engineering economics or administration and studied abroad likewise many of them have held before or after being presidents business management positions and in the public sector benavides highlighted in fact felipe bayon pardo is from bogota a mechanical engineer and has more than  years of experience in the hydrocarbon industry since february   he has been the executive vice president of ecopetrolecopetrol denounced acts of vandalism in the surroundings of the pio xii village in guamal the state oil company reported that during the mobilization of the loads from the drill that will drill the  well in the pio xii village in the municipality of guamal meta there were a series of acts of sabotage in the vicinity of the property where the perform the jobs likewise ecopetrol revealed that over the weekend unknown persons stole two highresistance plastic plates that it had placed on a culvert that was damaged and which facilitated the transit of community vehicles along the  gauge road that leads to the la property obstinacy on that same section a large number of screws and tacks have been found that have caused damage to the tires to the vehicles and third parties have stolen the signage that was installed as a preventive measure to move the loads the company reiterated that its operations are carried out in strict compliance with colombian legislation and rejects any de facto means of pressure to prevent the company from advancing in the mission of identifying new oil reservesbayon takes office as president of ecopetrol and takes on a great profit challenge as the minister of finance mauricio cardenas had already mentioned one of the great challenges for the next president of the most important company in the country will be to achieve   billion in profits to increase shareholders dividends precisely today felipe bayon mechanical engineer from the universidad de los andes took office and will take on this new challenge according to cardenas the goal of the new president will be that next year at least   billion in profits will be achieved this will make it possible to meet the objectives of the company and the nation in the short and medium term which are exploratory campaigns and offshore hydrocarbon exploitation in addition to improving the generation of dividendscamilo marulanda will be the new president of isagen starting in november camilo marulanda current president of ashmore caf management company and member of the board of directors of the canadian oil company frontera energy will assume the position as president of isagen as of december related article after  years luis fernando rico retires from isagens management in this way the former executive vice president of ecopetrol will replace luis fernando rico who announced his retirement in may of this year after  years at isagen  marulanda has a high knowledge in the energy mining sector and during his time at the state oil company he was the first president of the transportation subsidiary cenit and general director of ecopetrol operations he was in charge of informing the presidency of the operation of the fields in the countryproducing  barrels of oil per day in  will deepen the fiscal gap in inside lr francisco lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp affirmed that there is a great possibility that with the continuous drop in production in  it will be approximately  barrels per day and even crude oil will have to be imported  although this panorama contrasts with the mediumterm fiscal framework presented by the ministry of finance where a production of  bpd is forecast for  it does not stop causing concern among analysts who pose a scenario of more taxes and disinvestment if we take into account that currently the average production is  bpd according to the national hydrocarbons agency anh a figure of  bpd would represent a decrease of more than half of the countrys revenues according to diego franco president of franco infrastructure at franco group the government is going to receive less money and therefore there will be less investment in education and infrastructure the municipalities that benefit from the royalties would be left without the money to carry out projects in short the economy would run out of investment said franco likewise franco pointed out that with a decrease in production all the infrastructure available for the activity would not be needed so it would also have to return drills machinery also layoffs it is the worst scenario  he reiterated for eduardo sarmiento director of the economic research center cie of the julio garavito school of engineering although it is a rather distant scenario it would also mean a deficiency of foreign exchange income so the government would be obliged to look for them in other places as in industrial and agricultural activity  similarly for camilo silva manager of valora inversiones with a production of  barrels there would be a loss of the countrys investment grade rating the entry of dollars into the economy would be reduced by at least  so the dollar would skyrocket and could reach   in that sense there would be higher inflation because there is a bulk of imported products or that depend on imported raw materials likewise there would be an increase in the interest rate silva said likewise silva explained that there would be a tax increase because it is the fastest way to cover the fiscal gap for all these reasons he assured that it is important for people to understand that a decrease in oil production has a direct impact on the pocketbook which is why the routes to oil and mining cannot be closed ecopetrols projections also include the possibility that if unconventional fields are not exploited after  there would be no crude to load refineries and supply the country in fact for lloreda the only way not to reach that scenario is for us to do well in the improved recovery get more oil and gas from those fields it will depend on what happens with the unconventional fields there is immense potential for colombia but we cannot continue to do so if we want a massive incorporation of barrels and that production in five or  years can return to one million barrels   he assured for diego franco there is also another ace up his sleeve if the country does not get new discoveries there is the possibility of buying reserves in other countries he said a new attack in cano limoncovenas ecopetrol activated the contingency plan for the cano limoncovenas pipeline due to an attack that occurred at around  am yesterday in the el consuelo village in saravena arauca according to the company the event produced a spill of crude oil in

that these savings and these efficiencies are sustainable over time said bayon in relation to investment we see an investment level of around   trillion per year at us   a barrel if the price rises investment would increase the most important message is that if in the past years there was a emphasis on mid and downstream from now on we see that  of the investment will go to exploration and production which is important due to the issue of reserves and energy security said the president of ecopetrol in the upstream the exploration around us   million  wells with six of them offshore

operated by ecopetrol turned to the right said bayon without a doubt a milestone for the company according to the manager specifically regarding the unconventionals bayon pointed out that based on a study the potential of colombia is between   billion and   billion the most important thing in unconventionals for me is transparency with the communities  by definition our industry not only handles uncertainties but also risks and our role is to minimize risks and be comfortable with residual risk said bayonmoodys raises ecopetrol sas outlook to stable the rating agency moodys raised ecopetrol

in colombia and in the other member countries guzman explainedecopetrol and bancolombia the ones with the highest market capitalization having the most expensive share on the stock exchange does not necessarily mean having the company with the highest market capitalization since according to data from the bvc the company with the highest market value is ecopetrol since its value is set at   billion  although its title is one of the lowest in the basket since on monday it closed at   according to diego franco president of franco group the nominal price of a share has nothing to do with whether it is expensive or not since this value depends on the equity and the number of papers that are put on the market in this way what is taken into account is the multiplication between the number of shares and the price of each one of them which will yield the companys market price explained the expert so one share worth   and another   does not mean that one is expensive and the other is not they only explain a relationship after the oil company the stock with the highest capitalization in the bvc is bancolombia which has a value of   billion while its price was traded at   on october  in the third place of the companies that are worth the most in the capital market it is closed by grupo aval which is valued at   billion due to the fact that its share ended last monday at   the top five of the most valuable are completed by grupo nutresa and grupo sura with   billion and   billion respectively the market value of a company is related to many factors such as the size of the company equity profits investment plans among many other variables which in the end determine how much the share can be worth and the company in the market according to fabio suarez an expert in markets and securities at the cooperative university of colombia another company that exceeds   billion in the stock market is banco de bogota since its price is estimated at more than   billion according to suarez because the level of demand for the bank will always be high since people regularly  goes to this type of entity to finance different aspects such as education housing automobiles etc in addition to ecopetrol one of the most valuable public companies in the variable income market is empresa de energia de bogota which is currently priced at around   billion while grupo argos and cementos argos the ones that follow on the list have a value of   billion and   billion each on the contrary in this list of  companies those with the lowest value are banco de occidente   billion gas natural   billion grupo bolivar   billion bbva   billion and banco davivienda   billion in total taking into account these twenty firms between them they reach a value of   billion gas natural the most expensive share if the nominal price of each security is taken into account the highest is that of gas natural since each species was traded on october  at   almost twice the value of the paper of the grupo sura which was quoted at   when a share begins to be very nominal one has the impression that it begins to be less traded so companies use a figure called a split which is that instead of having a share at   they have  at   franco explained who added that many colombian companies do not go public for fear of speculators and for fear that other people outside the company may participate in decisionmaking other securities with high value are those of grupo bolivar which was quoted at   those of grupo nutresa which reached   and banco de occidente   davivienda title the most traded davivienda preferred share  was the most traded share of the day on the bvc moving more than   million on the day another of the most negotiated was ecopetrol  which negotiated   million on the other hand among the shares that gained the most ground were canacol energy which gained  and closed at   and those of grupo aval which had a positive variation of  and closed at   it is worth mentioning that the most devalued was that of the grupo argos preferential  the contrasts diego franco president of franco group the nominal price of a companys share depends on the assets and the number of papers that they want to put on the market fabio suarez expert in securities from the cooperative university the price of a share is determined by various factors such as profits and equity it shows the strength or not of a companyecopetrol obtained an invention patent for the air injection method ecopetrol sa reported that the superintendency of industry and commerce sic through resolution  granted an invention patent to the technology entitled oxidation line system and process for simulation of insitu combustion of heavy and extraheavy crude oil  it is a system and a method developed by researchers from the colombian petroleum institute icp which simulates the emulsions that can be registered in the in situ combustion or air injection processes which are used to improve the displacement of the heavy and extra heavy crude to the producing wells as explained by the company in a statement the control of the emulsions that are generated in the process is vital for the commercial success of the application of the technology to increase the thermal recovery factor in fields with this type of crude the researchers were able to find the optimal operating parameters such as chemical characteristics of the oxidized crude oils oxidation temperature ranges and the air injection rate that simulate the emulsions that are registered at an industrial level with this

according to the dnp according to the index of preparation for big data in the colombian state prepared by the national planning department dnp only  of public entities have the conditions to advance in the implementation of big data precisely the entity that has the most digital information is ecopetrol with  tb terabytes stored and which far exceeds dian which has  tb and is second in the ranking the top  is complemented by the general direction of the national police with  tb the colombian geological survey with  tb fodesep higher education development fund with  tb the comptroller

interventions to face current challenges in terms of generating social and economic value with the exploitation of digital data  commented luis fernando mejia director of the dnp the official even added that only  of the information assets that are public and digitized are published digitally another figure that shows the current situation is that  of entities face barriers to accessing public sector data arguing that the greatest is the excess of procedures followed by the complexity of requirements this first xray is useful to the dnp within the framework of the national development plan  all for a new country for the structuring of the public policy of data exploitation big data of the colombian state which must present as conpes document in this second semester of the yearless than

than half of the information of public entities is in a digital format in which the data can be extracted for use the dnp conducted a survey of  entities of the national order and found that the absence of data culture shows the challenge of recognizing this information as a strategic asset of the nation only  of the entities have the conditions to move consistently towards the implementation of big data and the use of data the remaining  require specific interventions to face current challenges in terms of generating social and economic value with the exploitation of digital data  said mejia mejia added that the survey found for example that  of entities perceive that open data from other entities is not important for their own operation and that  consider that it is not relevant to

and reached an average price of   which represented an increase of   compared to the representative market rate trm which was located at   this small upward price change is related to the start of the monthly meeting held by the united states federal reserve said orlando santiago manager of fenix valor adding that the world hopes that interest rates will not change although there will always be some who expect a sudden rise which is highly unlikely but which leads the currency to have some kind of increase in its price especially in countries like colombia today when the feds decision is known after  pm the colombian market will already be closed so the response can be seen in fridays session with a slight drop in the price of the currency santiago pointed out it is worth mentioning that the currency opened yesterday with a price of   and its closing was   on the other hand the minimum price that was registered on the setfx platform was minutes after the opening when it fell to   while the maximum was around  am and reached   the amount negotiated during the day was us   million in  transactions the average amount of negotiation was us   although the largest negotiation took place around us   million one of the currencies that had a greater rebound against the us currency was the chilean peso because yesterday it closed at its highest level in almost three weeks due to a new rebound in the price of copper the largest shipment of the country which was accompanied by the weakness of the dollar in external markets in this way the peso rose  to  units per buyer dollar and  units sold the mexican peso also managed to rebound and closed at  per dollar with a gain of  or  compared to  in the price on tuesday as for oil the benchmark brent its price managed to rise for the third day in a row driven by opec forecasts of higher demand for next year by  pm the london benchmark was up eus   to us   a barrel while the wti rose us   to us  ecopetrol competes with  companies for four blocks in the brazilian offshore one of ecopetrols priorities is to increase hydrocarbon reserves which is why it has focused on its strategy to strengthen and diversify exploration and production activities in colombia and abroad related article global oil market would be balanced in  even with higher production under this premise it was awarded two blocks in mexico and now in brazil it has prequalified for the third round in deep waters shared production promoted by the national agency do petroleo gas natural e biocombustiveis anp which offers four blocks in the campos and santos basins according to the anp in the santos basin are the pau brasil blocks with an area of  square kilometers peroba with  and alto de cabo friooeste with  in campos the alto de cabo friocentral block is on offer with  square kilometers all have a sevenyear exploration or evaluation phase in the race for these blocks ecopetrol has  rivals besides petrobras there is also bp and shell from the united kingdom cnodc and cnooc of china exxon mobil and chevron of the united states petrogal from portugal qpi of qatar petronas carigali from malaysia repsol from spain statoil from norway and total from france felipe bayon president of ecopetrol highlighted the importance of the rio de janeiro country for the company and pointed out that these basins have had important discoveries of liquids the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol right now ecopetrol is looking at offshore prospects in some places where there have been discoveries and that makes it attractive from a technical point of view brazil has a very important history of great discoveries it is a country where ecopetrol has been present for many years and clearly from the technical and commercial point of view these are interesting things that we are going to consider rigorously to define how we participate in those rounds he said at this point it is important to remember that ecopetrol arrived in brazil in  the year in which it also incorporated ecopetrol oleo e gas do brasil ltda which is based in rio de janeiro similarly the ecopetrol group has participation in three exploration blocks in that market german corredor director of the colombian energy observatory of the national university pointed out that in brazil there have been great discoveries offshore and it is important that ecopetrol acquire more experience in this regard if big oil companies enter it is because possibly there is a lot of potential corredor concluded but how does the process go on october  the public auction of bids will be held and according to the anp the brazilian version of the national hydrocarbons agency companies may submit bids only for blocks located in the sectors for which they have payment of participation fee and offer guarantee provided likewise the entity highlighted that the winning companies are those that offer the brazilian state from a minimum established percentage most of the oil and natural gas produced that is most of the oil surplus on the other hand a point that must be taken into account is that petrobras in accordance with the legislation can act as an operator precisely in round three it will have a  stake in the peroba and alto de cabo friocentral blocks therefore petrobras must establish a consortium with the winning bidder in case the percentage of oil of benefit offered is equal to the minimum defined in the tender or decide in the public session if it will participate in a consortium in case it is higher the percentage in the event that it does not participate in the consortium the winning bidder individually or in association will assume  participation in the block said the anp balance in the global oil market in  according to the international energy agency iea the global oil market will balance largely in  as consumption growth would contribute to erode excess fuel and offset in much of the sharp increase in production we see that three quarters out of four will be more or less balanced using the assumption of unchanged opec production and based on normal weather conditions the iea was quoted as saying by reutersstable oil forecasts there are reasons to hope that this end of  and the start of  will be better economically macro conditions are picking up while what was in the hands of the economic authorities has been done little by little such as lowering intervention rates in the market to around  it is not a secret that the colombian economy continues to depend to a large extent on what happens with the price of oil a matter on which there are already inputs to be optimistic because according to the latest announcement of the international energy agency equilibrium is observed between supply and demand a situation that will be reached even if there is an increase in production it is worth remembering the imbalance caused in the national accounts as a result of the fall to less than us   a barrel of oil which began at the end of  an external situation that has passed the bill of collection to royalties to works infrastructure and the oil sector with its related services that have not been able to get past one of the worst crises in its history the crisis of low oil prices was eloquently observed in ecopetrols profits which are not only the best thermometer on the colombian stock exchange since more than half a million colombians  legal and natural  own shares in the company mixed but its profits feed the national budget in the best years the company transferred to the government about   billion in times of fat cows but with the fall in oil prices transfers were even suspended leaving a huge gap that merited complex tax reforms the rise or stability of a barrel of oil in international markets is always bittersweet news for colombia firstly because the price of gasoline is tied to the external context and good because more can be exported it is no secret to anyone that black gold continues to be the most expensive national export product and that it significantly affects the trade balance which will begin to improve the agency says in its latest monthly report that there is an improvement in the demand for oil around the world and that the effects of the production cuts applied by the opec countries and by other large oil producers such as russia will allow to recover the balance in the oil market during the next financial year news that makes things look more optimistic this balance between supply and demand would be reached even with a rebound in production figures that is if countries like the united states and russia continue to increase their exports the colombian accounts were hit in the last three years by the excess supply that took the price of oil to its lowest in decades for a couple of weeks more or less the barrel of wti and brent have already broken the barrier of the us   the agencys report says that world demand for crude oil will grow by  million barrels a day in  and by  million barrels in  crude oil reserves in industrialized countries fell in august by   million barrels it is a good outlook that takes ecopetrol at a good time thanks to its latest restructuringetbs share is the one with the best yields on the colombian stock exchange this friday the stock that managed to close the week with the best returns on the bvc was etb after it advanced  and its price stood at   regarding others with notable increases the behavior of mineros was recorded which rose  remaining at   per share and closely was conconcreto with  growth and   per role in the list of securities that presented the greatest drops the most significant drop was for the preferred stock of corficolombiana since at the end of the week it fell  at a price of   the second place went to the grupo sura papers these depreciated  reaching a closing price of   the third place went to isa this title lost  and its value was   for each share on the side of the companies that managed to move high volumes through their negotiations the first place was in the preferential paper of the davivienda bank since it traded   million ecopetrol followed moving   million and also with high volumes the preferred title of bancolombia with   million finally in other indicators the main stock index of the colombian stock exchange the colcap fell  and after the close it was  units likewise the coltes of fixed income also ended down with  in  points and the colir of variable income with  the colcap fell due to a statistical issue the market was overbought in some assets and once  units were broken it would continue to decline as it was a moving average it responded to a technical issue explained the president of franco gruop diego francoecopetrol and petronas signed an agreement and will develop projects on the continent as part of its expansion on the continent the state oil company ecopetrol signed a memorandum of understanding with petronas one of the main hydrocarbon companies in malaysia with the aim of consolidating a strategic alliance between the two companies and being able to expand its work in the continent in fact these two companies already participate as partners in block  which is part of round  in shallow waters of the gulf of mexico for oil exploration the agreement was signed between the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon and the executive vice president of petronas datuk mohd anuar taib and aims to express the intention of the companies to negotiate commercial agreements that allow them to develop exploration and production projects in the american continent according to a statement from the colombian oil company another point contemplated in this agreement has to do with the exchange of information according to which the companies will work and share good business practices as well as technical and technological information in the areas of offshore exploration and production as well as natural gas and petrochemicals  other topics that this agreement will deal with have to do with the negotiation of products and oil cost optimization and improved recovery projects in addition the collaboration agreement extends to the evaluation of possible projects in natural gas as well as to analyze commercial opportunities for the negotiation and sale of oil and natural gas in the international market ecopetrol completed with which the possibility of expanding your business landscape with this memorandum some of the reasons that led ecopetrol to sign this agreement with petronas is that it is the main integrated oil and gas company in malaysia and is among the largest companies in the world this asian company has participation in different segments of the hydrocarbon market as well as refining and petrochemicals this

the company with the best results in promoting a collaborative business environment and knowledge transferecopetrol will create a company to enter the electric power business as reported by ecopetrol through a statement in the financial superintendence the board of directors approved the constitution of the company ecopetrol energia sasesp where it will have a direct and indirect  stake with an initial capital of   million the objective of the company will be the generation transformation and commercialization of energy as well as the provision of services related related or complementary to the generation transformation and commercialization of electrical energy for the ecopetrol business group and third parties according to laws  and  of  the company said with this new subsidiary the oil company seeks to reduce the cost of electrical energy and thus achieve an optimization of the companys costs in addition you could receive income from sales to third parties such as energy from the bioenergy plant however in principle the idea is to improve energy use within the groups companies which is one of the largest consumers with about  megawatts a figure similar to the consumption of the department of atlantico once those operations are optimized the longterm plan would be to deliver power to the system the authorized capital of this company will be   million and the constitution of this company is pending the approval of the national governmentodinsa was the stock that appreciated the most on the colombian stock exchange after the recent closing in the colombian stock exchange bvc odinsas share was the one with the best results after having risen  and reaching a starting price of   it was followed by the etb title which advanced  thus trading at   per share ecopetrol closely appeared which had a positive variation of  so each paper is trading at   on the side of the titles that fell mineros was the stock that registered the greatest drop after having lost  compared to the previous day and ending at   per paper then with downward behavior the preferential title of grupo argos was found which fell  leaving an exit value of   and bancolombia which fell  to   for its part the list of the most traded shares was led by ecopetrol which moved   million then grupo sura with operations for   million and preferential bancolombia with a volume of   million the colcap remained stable at  units and the colir lost ecopetrol share broke the ceiling of   and grows more than  on the day one of the strongest impacts for ecopetrol shareholders was the fall in the price of its species on the colombian stock exchange bvc which today showed growth that had not been seen for more than two years breaking the ceiling of the   according to the bvc the share of the state oil company is negotiated at   and grows just today  which according to felipe bayon president of ecopetrol is a recognition of the efforts made have made in part as explained by the company the recovery of its share is due to the jp morgan report which modified the recommendation to neutral after two years of having a lower recommendation within this analysis financial improvements were taken into account amid high operational challenges in addition to efforts to reduce costs and a better outlook for crude oil prices which may improve the cash position of the oil company in this sense bayon considered that analysts experts in the sector say that indeed ecopetrols efforts in terms of efficiencies savings and cost reduction are very important along with this he again raised one of the challenges on which the company has focused the president of the state oil company said that now what we have is the challenge of the growth of reservesjp morgans approval of ecopetrol hits the stock to the upside the behavior of ecopetrols share on the colombian stock exchange bvc surprised this thursday as it not only exceeded the resistance of   per share but also achieved its record in the last two years with a closing price of   and a rise of  this recovery of the species of the state oil company was partly explained by the improvement in the recommendation issued by jp morgan which became stable highlighting the savings that the company has made to adjust to the low international oil prices in addition to an improvement in the financial situation amid high operational challenges these factors in addition to a prospect of higher crude prices led this financial company to improve its recommendation on ecopetrol with which it should increase its cash position and become more competitive in the tenders in which it participates in the continent  this fact was recognized by the president of the oil company felipe bayon who stressed that the improvement is a recognition of the efforts that have been made aimed at reducing costs and optimizing processes among others bayon considered that the action has recovered but it comes in a process of several days and is a recognition analysts say that the efforts in terms of efficiency savings and cost reduction are very important however both the jp morgan report and the president of ecopetrol agreed that the biggest challenge is increasing reserves a task in which the oil company is already preparing the document warns that this improvement in the financial situation does not reduce the companys main challenge which continues to increase the short useful life of oil reserves in the medium and long term while maintaining its production levels in the short term another negative point of the report has to do with a slower than estimated growth in crude production with high capital commitments and not being able to meet the companys operational goals thus the president of the oil company reaffirmed that this decline that has been taking place must be reversed jp morgan has given some areas in which we have to continue working grupo argos preferential share the one that fell the most in the bvc after ending the day on thursday in the colombian stock exchange bvc within the list of shares that fell the most preferencial grupo argos was the most affected after losing  and remaining at   then followed the preferential title of grupo sura since it fell  and its exit cost was   grupo argos appeared closely but with its ordinary paper which registered a  drop at a price of   regarding the securities with the best yields of the day ecopetrol achieved the greatest advance after rising  so its share is now at   later the success appeared with a rise of  to   and the third place of the papers that grew the most was for banco de bogota which rose  its starting price was   on the side of the shares that had the highest trading volumes the first place went to ecopetrol which managed to trade   million the second best record was achieved by the preferred title of bancolombia since it achieved transactions for   million and close by was hcolsel with movements for   million finally in other indicators the main stock market index the colcap closed higher after rising  and reaching  units the same growth as the colirthe price of a barrel of brent reached us   its highest level since july  at  am the benchmark brent oil was trading above us   per barrel which represented an increase of   in its price which at the opening of the session stood at us   per unit related article brent closes at  highs driven by comments from saudi arabia in this way the london benchmark hit alltime highs of  months since since july  there were no prices above us   in the international market related article saudi arabia is determined to end excess oil part of this upward pace is due to the announcements by saudi arabia the worlds leading oil producer to extend supply reduction agreements likewise the market reacted to the good results of the opec agreement to reduce the oil oversupplyfor now ecopetrol has no interest in the distribution of electricity in addition to entering a business that is becoming more important in the world given the sustained increase in the demand for electrical energy the approval by the board of directors to create ecopetrol energia sasesp is also in line with the oil companys purpose of reducing costs felipe bayon president of the company said that the interest is to look within and to be able to make the use of energy more efficient we are not thinking about distribution  likewise the manager commented that ecopetrol consumes  megawatts of electricity which is equivalent to the demand of the department of atlantico and represents  of the countrys consumption according to company data of that demand  mw are selfgenerated that is  and cost us   million per year while  mw are purchased in the national interconnected system sin for a value of us   million in other words the total cost per year is us   million the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol the savings we achieve in generation commercialization and consumption of energy help to reduce costs of construction and operation in this sense the savings we achieve through efficiencies in the generation commercialization and consumption of energy will help us to have a reduction in lifting and operating costs explained bayon seen from the type of operation the greatest demand for energy is in production  with  mw selfgenerated and  mw purchased on the grid then there is refining with a  stake and the only business that produces all the energy it needs and finally transportation  with  selfgenerated mw and  mw purchased on the grid two thirds of the energy we consume is generated by ourselves we have large generation equipment more than  mw of installed capacity we consume the rest from other sources on the market  stated bayon precisely in relation to the installed capacity to produce energy  mw  has production with  mw includes equion essentia and bioenergy  refining with  mw barrancabermeja and reficar refinery and  transportation with  mw cenit ocensa and oleoducto de los llanos orientales sa at this point it must be clarified that not all of them are interconnected to the sin however it is important to mention that for example bioenergy sells its surplus energy to the national electricity grid this was stated by the company on october  when it reported that it has produced  million liters of ethanol at the same time it has generated  mwh of energy of which  mwh have been sold to the national electricity grid and the remainder has supplied the operation of the plant bioenergy reported in a statement the constitution of ecopetrol energia sasesp will assume the energy purchase process required by the business group for its operations and the sale of selfgeneration surpluses this would eliminate intermediaries in this regard alejandro castaneda executive director of the national association of generating companies andeg explained that precisely the sale of surpluses can be done in two ways directly if you are a marketer if not there is a representative  according to the company the new subsidiary should start operating in the first quarter of  after the approval of the board of

this year one of the ways to assess how the hydrocarbon sector is doing is with the number of exploratory wells drilled according to the monthly report of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol until september  exploratory wells were registered an increase of  if one takes into account that in that same month in  there were  wells according to information from the national hydrocarbons agency anh  of the exploratory wells drilled are in casanare which means that this department has  of the total followed by meta with six german corredor director of the national university energy observatory explained that the entire area of the piedmont llanero is geologically the same area so from the point of view of the possibility of finding oil it is the same in third place is the colombian offshore with four exploratory wells the socalled purple angel gorgon siluro and brahma respectively the operators were anadarko in the case of the first two the spanish company repsol and the brazilian company petrobras at this point it is important to remember that purple angel and gorgon checked for gas while catfish was dry of the five offshore wells planned this year only molusco is missing which is being drilled and work has not yet been completed molusco is an icon for ecopetrol as it is the first offshore well that is  operated by the state oil company which

a compliance percentage of  compared to the goal of  wells set by the anh for the end of  from his perspective the anhs goal is will meet and even the number will be higher the good news is that there is growing activity in the sector he concluded other data on the regional context according to the data presented by campetrol in its september report on the regional context based on information from the anh the five main producing departments contributed  of the total production with meta ranking in first place with a  stake and casanare with  then there are santander arauca and putumayo

according to estimates by the brokerdealer casa de bolsa ecopetrol could generate profits of about   billion this year well above the   billion recorded the previous year the fundamental reason for this increase is the rise that brent has had in recent weeks since june the london benchmark has gained  in its price as while in june it hit a minimum of us   at this time around  pm it is trading at us   per barrelecopetrols share had the biggest rise of the day on the stock market the announcements of prolonging the oil production cuts in the international market favored ecopetrol so that its

seven wells that supply gas at the sardinata plant the company said in a statement the gas plant processes and sells an average of  cubic feet per day benefiting  users in the rural and urban areas of tibu and  residential and industrial users in cucuta the companies gases del oriente and proviservicios were notified about the measure to activate their contingency plans in the supply of natural gas to users according to the company these blockades also temporarily suspend three contracts that are added to six from the previous week leaving  people unemployed likewise  barrels of oil have not been produced in tibuecopetrol halted operations at the sardinata gas plant due to the constant blockades that have occurred in norte de santander precisely in the municipality of tibu due to the peasant strike that has been going on for more than a week ecopetrol was forced to suspend the operations of the sardinata gas plant located in this territory in the catatumbo area according to the oil company this gas plant located in campo tibu sells and processes approximately  cubic feet per day of this input which according to the companys data supplies about  users in the area rural and urban of the northeastern municipality another  residential and industrial users located in cucuta and its metropolitan area will also have to suffer the consequences of the plants cessation of activities faced with the imminent risk of operational situations that could affect people communities or the environment the company shut down seven wells that supply gas in a safe and controlled manner ecopetrol reported this situation has already been notified to the companies gases del oriente and proviservicios so that they can activate their contingency plans in the supply of natural gas in the area it is worth mentioning that in addition to the six contracts that were suspended the previous week due to blockades at the entrance to the field this contingency forced the oil company to suspend another three contracts which left more than  people unemployed and impeded production of  barrels of oil in tibu ecopetrol rejects this type of situation that affects the normal operation of the company and the provision of essential public services for the communities the company saidis this the right time to buy ecopetrol shares taking into account  high oil prices a dollar that continues to rise beyond   and ecopetrols results within a week a question that may be on your mind is whether it is time to buy stocks of the oil company which in the second semester have appreciated  exactly four years ago when the price of a barrel of brent was close to its historical maximum precisely at us   per barrel the ecopetrol share was trading at   however due to the fall in prices in january  it bottomed out and reached   per unit now with a recovery from the london benchmark added to the companys good results in the second quarter the stock recovered again and between july and november it went from   to   that is a gain of   for its investors  according to the forecasts of the commission agent casa de bolsa the species of the company under the command of felipe bayon must be monitored because if it manages to stay above   it could gradually seek to close between   and   because the species has already reached the level we expected at this time the purchase recommendation is in neutral said omar suarez the firms equity manager who also stressed that from a technical point of view this level is very important which has relied mainly on good financial results a higher net profit than last year likewise they have done the task very well in terms of costs and expenses explained suarez on the subject daniel escobar director of the global securities strategy department stated that according to different analyzes made by local and foreign entities ecopetrols value is below the fair price in this way if the investor has a shortterm look it is advisable to buy but if on the contrary it is a structural vision it is best to keep waiting said the analyst next week punctually on tuesday the companys third quarter results will be published because the price started to rise recently and there was not a strong increase in production the market does not expect a surprising result escobar said adding that it will be necessary to see how the behavior was in the operational issue which is more complicated to forecast considering this andres duarte director of equities at corficolombiana said that for the moment it is best to wait for the companys thirdquarter results and to show the recent evolution of cost efficiency and the sensitivity of the results before taxes on oil prices the contrasts omar suarez gte equity market of casa de bolsa from a technical point of view the level of   per share is very important and we expect it to remain at that level daniel escobar director of strategy department of global securities since oil recently rebounded the market does not expect surprising quarterly results from ecopetrol another point that must be taken into account according to analysts are the projections of crude oil prices in the international market because saudi arabia and other nations have committed to extending production cuts until next year which it can maintain the price of the commodity at levels close to those of the day today which in suarezs opinion can lead to  being a very good year for the company it is worth mentioning that around  pm the price of brent  was trading at us   per barrel promigas the one that fell the most in the bvc promigas share was the one that fell the most on the day due to a negative variation of  which led it to close the session at   furthermore bancolombia shares  continue to fall after the financial data for the third quarter on the other hand carton de colombia had the most significant advance of the day rising  while the ecopetrol species  was the most traded with   million the colcap index fell  and closed at  unitsbusiness results and weak economy have affected colcap the last few weeks have not been good for the colombian stock market mainly due to two factors the first is related to the  fall in the colcap index the most important on the stock exchange bvc since september while the second is related to the financial results published by the companies this week the first thing to say is that currently the main index of the colombian stock market is far from its maximum level for the year which stood at  units on june  in part due to the business results of some companies that were below market expectations one of the examples is bancolombia because since the results of the largest bank in the country were known the colcap index has not stopped falling thus the share of the financial entity went from   at the beginning of october to   during the day on friday which in the same way has impacted the price of the index although it is worth mentioning bancolombias results were not the only disappointing ones for the quarter companies such as fabricato isa enka cemex and other banks have shown results below expectations highlighted orlando santiago manager of fenix valor according to casa de bolsa if the level of  units is broken colcap could gradually seek support at  points although for santiago the situation will be rebuilt at the end of the year due to the good results expected by part of ecopetrol due to the rise in oil prices and of grupo exito the contrasts juan pablo cordoba president of the colombian stock exchange when there is a slowdown this is reflected in the markets with a decrease in the number of businesses which ends up decreasing revenues a bit orlando santiago manager of fenix valor the entire financial sector began to show very regular results this has been followed by regular data from some companies such as enka isa or fabricato marcela ramirez equity analyst at the firm actions  valores explained that the impact of ecopetrol is going to be felt in a great way because it is the second company that weighs the most within this basket of species likewise it is also expected that given the sharp fall in some stocks this will lead to them becoming attractive to the market and demand will push the colcap up again even the bvcs own results presented significant drops in terms of operating and net profits  and  respectively against this background juan pablo cordoba president of the stock exchange outlined that the situation has developed reasonably well from the valuation point of view although the poor performance of the economy affects trading volumes obviously when there is an economic slowdown this is reflected in the markets with a decrease in the number of businesses said the bvc president during the delivery of the companys results which was this week the executive stressed that the prospects for next year are much better the decrease in interest rates is a positive element for the markets and we believe that the worst of this cycle has passed in the market said cordoba mineros was the most valued of the day in the stock market at the close of the week the mineros share was the most valued in the stock market after gaining  in the session and closing at   on the opposite shore appeared the title of promigas since its species was the most devalued of the day after falling  which left its price for tuesday at   on the other hand ecopetrols paper  was the most traded on friday as it moved   million on the day colcap  continues in the doldrums and ended at  unitsecopetrol activated a contingency plan for a spill in the cano limoncovenas oil pipeline ecopetrol reported that this afternoon it activated the contingency plan to stop the oil spill detected in an aerial route in the jurisdiction of the cano victoria village in the municipality of tibu norte de santander as a result of the events the cano limon  covenas pipeline was taken offline preliminary information indicates that the spill was caused by the installation of an illegal valve to steal crude oil the spill affected the luna and victoria pipes which connect with the nuevo presidente river the contingency plan included the installation of containment barriers in the victoria channel and the activation of the permanent control point located on the nuevo presidente river environmental crews were also dispatched to clean up and collect crude oil ecopetrol asked the neighboring communities of the la victoria village to refrain from consuming the water from these affected water bodies and for prevention avoid the activation of hot spots with firewood cigarettes or stoves the situation was notified to corponor the municipal councils for disaster risk management of the department of norte de santander and the municipality of tibu as well as the public health area of this town once the public force secures the area ecopetrol technicians will enter to verify the causes of the incident and start maintenance workaccording to analysts ecopetrols revenues totaled   billion in the third quarter today after the financial market closes ecopetrol will release the financial and operating results for the third quarter in fact they will be the first in the presidency of felipe bayon as a prelude lr conducted a survey among some commission agents to see the analysts bets on the oil companys numbers and thus found that they expect revenues of more than   billion and net profits of more than   billion from the point of view of income the biggest bet was made by daniel escobar director of the strategy department of global securities who indicated that they could be in the order of   billion in the third quarter there was a production of  barrels per day so this added to the price of oil in colombian pesos gives ecopetrol higher income explained the analyst bancolombia and casa de bolsa bet on total sales of   billion ultraserfinco projected   billion while alianza valores indicated that it would be   billion thus the average income is at   billion although the projection of alianza valores is the lowest in the survey camilo thomas equity analyst at alianza valores pointed out that this has been a good year for the company due to the stability of oil prices which have remained stable at good levels and for a better business strategy with the attacks ecopetrol redirected the bicentenario pipeline and that did not affect them so much a combination of factors has predicted a good year and with the movements that we have seen in recent days in the stock market we see that good results are expected  explained thomas another of the indicators consulted by analysts was ebitda in which they bet on a figure greater than   billion global securities was again the one with the highest projection with   billion followed by ultraserfinco with   billion brokerage house with   billion bancolombia with   billion and alianza valores with   billion these figures show that the average ebitda is   trillion regarding net profit the average of the five analysts consulted was   trillion the biggest bet was made by casa de bolsa with   billion followed by ultraserfinco with   billion the others bet on   trillion although global securities is going for   trillioncompanies mentioned in the paradise papers explain the role of their subsidiaries according to the paradise papers a leak of  million documents revealed by the international consortium of investigative journalists icij are more than  colombians related to companies established in countries with tax benefits in addition they name large companies in the energy sector such as ecopetrol epm isa geb or glencore which have established captive reinsurers in bermuda according to information from connectas journalistic platform for the americas ecopetrol appears as the joint venture with the highest equity through its reinsurance company black gold re today more than half of its business structure depends on a conglomerate of firms in destinations such as bermuda switzerland or delaware in the united states  the investigation indicates that ecopetrol first came to use this type of firm through companies that inherited purchases and business with multinationals such as maurel  prom and british petroleum however faced with the accusations that these companies could be used as evasion tools the oil company defended the operations and pointed out that they use reinsurance companies and investment vehicles in switzerland as well as subsidiaries in the united states brazil and peru since without this option could not be invested in many countries if an operation is going to be carried out in the us it cannot be done from colombia because the legislation requires it to have a subsidiary there  in addition according to information provided to the icij at the time the reason for creating these companies in these jurisdictions was greater protection for investment and better regulation for financing now the doubt of the investigation is in the records of emails that were leaked between ecopetrol executives with appleby the law firm in charge of making the schemes in which a tax purpose was named the economist julio cesar alonso a professor at icesi clarified that having an account outside of colombia or a reinsurer is not illegal what must be made sure is that the money that is leaving the country is duly reported and for this reason for alonso on this occasion the actions of the competent entities must be faster than in the panama papers leak of documents in  that resulted in the capture of luz mary guerrero legal representative of efecty sa and other executives in september of this year the entities have to investigate those resources and find out if there was evasion in order to give an exemplary punishment in similar cases we have been able to see that this has not happened and that the actions of the authorities are quite slow said the expert epm also wanted to clarify its participation and pointed out that maxseguros its subsidiary since  based in bermuda has allowed it to have better insurance conditions and a significant optimization in the costs of risk transfer as an example they point out that their benefits are observed in the insurance payment for the  claim at the guatape hydroelectric which reached more than us   million and for which maxseguros paid us   million in addition they explain that all the required tax documents on how their reinsurer works are made available to the authorities regarding the leak horacio ayala former director of dian said that a tool to prevent evasion is to try to ensure that there are no territories with forbidden or confidential information ideally all states agree to exchange information as long as this is not done people will always find errors or ways in the system to do it  he pointed out in this action for the moment the work of dian will be to receive the documents and names and investigate those involved and then pass the cases with possible irregularities to the prosecutors office global education

initiative dedicated to finding solutions for financing and preparing families to assume the costs associated with higher education for their children in addition to this the president indicated that for helping as a member of the board they offered him the possibility of an option to acquire a minority stake which he resigned in  i never invested a single peso and i was never a partner of that company  he emphasized for its part global education assured that barbados is not a tax haven but a highly reputed jurisdiction between global banking and the international insurance industry so that was the reason for settling there from the beginning in addition in a statement he gave a piece of reassurance to his clients pointing out that the interpretations of their companies are wrong and that it currently operates in the jurisdiction of florida monitored by the colombian and us authorities and has not received any requirements regarding santos the company indicated that he was part of the board of directors but that he resigned when he was appointed a public official the president of the republic did not receive remuneration as a member of the board and declined an option that allowed him to be a minority partner global education said in a statement the paradise papers scandal also hit multinationals like apple uber and nike according to the investigation there are

market which grew  compared to the nine running months of  most of them middle distillates and ga solina in contrast exports which were mostly crude oil saw a reduction of  and totaled  boe another of the results that ecopetrol had in the period had to do with the differential of the crude export basket for the third quarter which was reduced by us   per barrel which is the best in the last seven years this as a result of the changes in the commercial strategy to reach the end customer directly as well as cuts made by opec especially in heavy crude and the demand for heavy crude in the gulf of mexico and asia similarly in the year seven wells have been drilled and completed of which six were exploratory purple      and  and one of outpost bullerengue  on the other hand in the  well drilled

higher operating and financial result compared to the same period of the previous year the ebitda of   billion and the ebitda margin of  stand out as the highest in the last two years for a cumulative nine months added bayon omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa assured that stable production close to  barrels per day plus higher oil prices both in annual and quarterly terms

reducing the spread of its hydrocarbon basket in front of brent  as explained by a source from the oil company before it was sold with a differential of us   or us   below brent because it was heavy crude but now they do so with us   or us   that is they earn us   or more the quarter closed with a cash position of   billion in addition to these good results the companys share grew  during the

billion which will translate into a significant increase in dividend payments for   rodrigo sanchez senior analyst of equities at ultraserfinco indicated that they could be located in the order of   billion we have good expectations with ecopetrol in the future however this depends on starting to make discoveries that can improve reserve levels it is the asterisk that the company has said sanchezepm alpina and bavaria among the favorites of the commission agents to reach the bvc due to the difficult time that colcap is going through which in the last eight weeks has lost approximately  of valuation some brokerage firms believe that if they joined the basket the most important companies in the country could give it in in the medium term a boost to the most important index on the stock market in such a way that for example several firms indicated that they would like to enter the stock market as issuers of shares of companies such as alpina epm colombina rappi or bavaria this would be a very important factor in expanding the colombian stock market and making it more attractive to investors among the advantages this represents for companies is that by having a broader base of investors external agents do a very good oversight of corporate governance which ends up improving processes and control explained camilo silva founding partner de valora inversiones who added that this would be an option for new startups that are looking for investment money to finish growing as facebook or snapchat did at the time in the same way much more transparent systems are created since all companies that are listed on the colombian stock exchange have to make all their reports public and there is strong regulation in addition in the stock market explained juan david ballen  director of investigations of casa de bolsa likewise companies can access the financial market more easily where they can find resources to finance investments works and all their expansion plans said the expert lr conducted a survey asking readers which company they would like to see listed thus epm was the most voted with  followed by alpina with  rappi  and el tiempo  for camilo thomas an analyst at alianza valores the appetite for the stock market would increase since for individuals it is very attractive to invest in large companies which look safe however thomas stressed this will not have any impact in the short term on the colcap index although it is expected that in the medium and long term a much more robust index will be obtained with larger companies and with a capitalization highest faced with all this panorama the question is why these companies are not listed on the stock market the analysts response is that some companies are not interested in losing control of their participation while others prefer to find resources through the issuance of local or foreign bonds with which control is not lost the contrasts camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones when external agents become part of a company they strengthen the oversight of the processes and allow companies to comply with their projections camilo thomas expert analyst at alianza valores we would very much like to see the largest and most emblematic companies in colombia on the stock market that contribute to the country and are already in the memory of consumers ecopetrol recorded the strongest rise of the day the good results that were expected from ecopetrol for the third quarter led the stock to have a strong rise of  and closed the day at   per unit this led to it being the most traded species of the day after moving more than   million on the other hand the security that fell the most in tuesdays session was the preferred one of cementos argos which lost  and ended the day at   regarding the colcap index it is worth mentioning that it recovered and managed to gain  to close at  unitsoil prices the horrible night ended there is good oil news entered the penultimate month of the year brent oil closed at us   a barrel while wti did the same at us   two prices that however compared are much higher than those registered during the current year they are even the most significant for three years little by little one of the worst hit sectors in recent years is beginning to recover when a barrel of crude oil went from cost about us   to us   on average a situation that opened a big hole in national finances and those of other countries that have in oil the product with the highest sales abroad the cause of this important spike in the price of oil has to do with the political upheaval in saudi arabia and the strategy adopted by the oilproducing countries belonging to opec which decided a couple of months ago to maintain production levels to avoid speculation in the market and prices falling analysts explain the rebound in prices at which saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter is clinging to the domestic policy of boosting oil prices at least for two more years because  in their words  there is international satisfaction with it agreement to reduce production between major exporters and other major producers such as russia since august  oil prices fell and dragged strong internal crises in some middle eastern countries and in venezuela ecuador and mexico just to look at three cases in the region but colombia was no exception and the fall in oil prices since  has been the fiscal explanation for the complicated situation of public finances but the recovery in crude oil prices is not only a third change in the sector there is also a reactivation in the wells drilled in  there were   in  and the number rises to  so far this year a significant amount and with consequences in the oil services sector and investments in production are estimated between us   and us   million it is a fact that  is coming as a year of oil reactivation a situation that will recreate a minibonanza that must be managed with moderation since believing ourselves oil again is one of the lessons that the price crisis has left us colombia is a country with oil that must maintain adequate production levels for its internal finances taking into account prices in the market but it should not make the mistake of believing itself to be an oil again and make the domestic economy depend on what happens with crude oil as happened at the beginning of the last decade and between the  and  in the old days of cano limon cusiana cupiagua rubiales and the famous piedemonte llanero when historical analysis is done and the backbone of the colombian economy is looked at only coffee appears between the late  and well into the  as an apparently inexhaustible source of foreign exchange and for a little more than three decades oil has been that export product that for some time kept the trade balance in surplus a situation that changed in  but now the economic country must find other complementary vocations to enter a time of more sustained developmentdollar fell   against the trm due to the rise in oil prices a decrease in global oil reserves led to brent  trading very close to mondays highs precisely at us   which caused the dollar to lose value against the colombian peso on thursdays day in such a way that at the close of the session the dollar reached an average price of   which represented a decrease of   compared to the representative market rate trm which stood at   it is worth noting that the currency opened the day with a price of   and its closing was of   similarly the minimum value that was registered on the setfx platform was   while the maximum was   the amount negotiated during the day was us   million in  transactions regarding the stock market the colcap index of the colombian stock exchange continued to show signs of recovery as it has been doing since ecopetrols results and closed with a  rise at  units the title of the oil company was the one that increased its price the most on the day as it ended at   which represented a positive variation of  on the other side the cementos argos share ended as it lost  in value which brought it to   while the preferred spice of bancolombia  was the one with the highest movement with   millionecopetrol requests clarification on debt from the barrancabermeja mayors office the oil company responded to the communication sent by the barrancabermeja ministry of finance according to which ecopetrol owes   million for the payment of the industry and commerce tax for the taxable year  to date there is no judicial authority decision that would have ordered ecopetrol to pay that sum of money the company said likewise it reported that on october   ecopetrol was notified by the municipal administration of resolution  of october   by means of which it finalizes a sanction and liquidates a tax for a value greater than   million decision regarding which we requested clarification from the municipal administration and to date no response has been notified  according to said communication from the barrancabermeja ministry of finance ecopetrol will have to answer for the debt or the municipality could carry out coercive collectionecopetrol has not received an order to pay the alleged debt with barrancabermeja the barrancabermeja ministry of finance expressed through a statement that ecopetrol owes the sum of   million for payments of the industry and commerce tax for taxable year  according to the mayors office this money that would have been received by the company was not delivered to the municipality as appropriate a debt that would force the municipality to proceed to coercive collection and judicial proceedings which implies a seizure on the entity if it does not cancel the millionaire sum within a specified period faced with the indications of the institution the oil company defended itself ecopetrol assured that to date there is no decision by a judicial authority that has ordered the company to pay this amount additionally given the notification received last october  by the municipal administration where a sanction is finalized and a tax for more than   million is settled the company requested the respective clarification of this determination from the municipality but to date have not received any response the income would have been reported incorrectly according to the barrancabermeja mayors office in other words the money registered for exports and other activities would have been caused to other municipalities however ecopetrol would also have the opportunity to sue the ruling before the administrative court of santander which would later refer the case to the council of state but this would not be the only case of this type according to the mayors office there would also be some investigations into the payment of the same tax but for the taxable year dollar closed the week down   and ended at   a constant fear in international markets for a possible postponement of the approval of the tax reform of the president of the united states donald trump led to the dollar losing ground against a wide basket of currencies around the world and ending the day with its biggest weekly decline in a month against the colombian peso the north american currency completed four days in a row in which it lost part of the value it gained at the beginning of the month in this way at the close of the day the dollar reached an average price of   which represented a decrease of   compared to the representative market rate trm that stood at   the currency opened the day with a price of   and its closing was of   the minimum value that was registered on the setfx platform was   while the maximum was   the amount traded during the last day of the week was more than us   million in  transactions which averaged us   per negotiation with a transaction of us   million being the highest of the day regarding oil although it had a slight fall of  which led it to close at us   per barrel around  pm the market expects it to remain at those levels due to the statements from the energy minister of the united arab emirates suhail bin mohammed almazroui who said that no one is talking about not extending the production cut wti oil also had a slight reduction of  and closed at us   per barrel colcap index fell  on the last day of the week the colcap index lost again part of the ground that it had recovered in recent days thus the most important index of the colombian stock exchange fell  in its price which led it to close at  units this in part was due to the drops in various securities such as corficolombianas preferential  grupo argoss  valorem  and grupo aval   as for the most valued of the day the list was headed by the preferred species of davivienda which rose  and closed at   followed by the av villas bank preferential  the most traded on the other hand was the preferential of bancolombia  which moved   millionwhy did  colombians sell their ecopetrol shares on november   ecopetrol debuted on the colombian stock exchange in the framework of the  years of this event it is worth analyzing the legacy of the oil company in our stock market and examining its impact on the finances of the households that invested in the company in practice the democratization of ecopetrol was a colossal task javier gutierrez the then president of the company toured the country promoting the sale of shares which in its first stage would be aimed exclusively at colombians and entities from the solidarity sector the result  shareholders in  municipalities and a total of   billion raised unprecedented numbers in our country perhaps the most representative but least known figure on the scope of the democratization process was the  investors who entered the stock market for the first time although most of these colombians made the minimum investment of   million the total amount of this group reached   billion in other words  of the public offering came to the hands of people who had never invested in stocks before the expectation was that the success of ecopetrols issuance would lead more colombian households to actively participate in the stock market however the story would be very different over the next decade world markets experienced the worst financial crisis in  years the public debt crisis in europe the slowdown in china and the fall in oil prices at the domestic level interbolsas embezzlement ended up undermining the fragile confidence of households both in the financial markets and in the bodies that regulate them between  and  of the  investors that went public with ecopetrol  sold all or most of their investment the new interest in investing in stocks did not materialize only  of investors bought stakes in other companies during this period despite all the above the purchase of ecopetrol shares was quite positive for household finances between dividends and appreciation the inexperienced colombians who bought and then sold their shares made profits of   billion equivalent to an annual rate of return of  undoubtedly attractive returns both in colombia and anywhere in the world apparently gutierrezs effort was not in vain to explain the exit of a quarter of a million colombians from their investments in stocks it is necessary to understand a global phenomenon fewer and fewer people invest directly in the stock markets individuals have been replaced by institutional investors who through mutual funds or collective portfolios minimize transaction costs promote diversification and offer advice to less informed clients this is what is known in the jargon of finance as economies of scale and scope which allows institutional investors to make more efficient and lowercost investments it is precisely in this context that ecopetrols legacy becomes more relevant because it showed us that the demand for new assets does exist even among the least financially sophisticated people to retain and increase the participation of these investors the challenge is to simplify the access channels improve the information available and design investment offers that are easy to understand with minimum amounts affordable for any citizenecopetrol exito nutresa and odinsa among the best results of the quarter this year has been one of recovery for the colombian economy and this has been reflected in the business results of the third quarter where few companies have shown good results such as grupo exito odinsa and ecopetrol as for the company directed by carlos mario giraldo it was known that in the first nine months of the year it had consolidated revenues of   billion which represented an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year on the other hand the consolidated ebitda so far this year was   trillion with a growth of  while the net profit was more than   million with an improvement of more than   million compared to the same period of the previous year the results as of september of this year allow us to maintain confidence in the strategy established in each of the countries where we operate in colombia we continue to strengthen the expansion of surtimayorista developing innovative initiatives such as carulla fresh market the first place in the whole country that offers meat with the certified sustainable livestock seal said carlos mario giraldo president of grupo exito who added that the results in brazil have been positive for the organization however an analysis by casa de bolsa indicated that the results were weak slightly below market expectations despite the increase in revenues the more than proportional increases in operating costs and expenses generated that the operating profit presented annual and quarterly reductions the report concluded as for odinsa the grupo argos concessions company it added revenues of   million with an increase of  in the third period of the year while ebidta was   million  more than in the same period of  at the time the company assured that the results obtained confirm its strategic approach evidence a rigorous operation of its assets and that they were largely driven by a good performance in its road concessions that registered a traffic of more than  million vehicles  the president of the company mauricio ossa said that the results achieved during this quarter are a reflection of a strategic management focused on rigorously managing road and airport concessions boosting traffic and strengthening the experience for our users ecopetrol from which the market expected very good results did not disappoint during the third quarter the company reported a net profit of   trillion a figure four times higher compared to the same period last year when it reached   million according to felipe bayon president of the company accumulated net income amounted to   trillion and represents double that registered in all of  these results reflect our solidity and the constant improvements in operating and commercial capacity greater efficiency and cost reduction focus on capital discipline and additionally a better oil price environment  production during the third quarter remained at  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped as in the first half it should be noted that in this period there was a significant increase in the prices of the brent benchmark oil since it was operating between us   and us   per barrel for casa de bolsa the results were positive the companys income benefited from the increase in the price of oil a more favorable exchange rate and the improvement in the export crude differential in the report presented to the financial superintendency it was also noted that the companys sales reached   billion  more than between july and september  when they were   billion so far this year revenues are   billion despite the low consumption of colombians so far this year grupo nutresas balance is positive this was announced by the company through a statement in the financial superintendency in which it stated that in the first nine months of  sales have grown  which has allowed them a turnover close to   billion similarly according to the holding company the accumulated ebitda already amounts to   million which is equivalent to  of sales on the opposite shore are several of the most important companies in the country such as bancolombia isa grupo sura colombina or cemex latam holdings in its report corresponding to the third quarter the financial entity showed that its accumulated net profits as of september reached   trillion which implied a reduction of  justified by the economic cycle that has been reflected in the deterioration of the portfolio that means higher provisions and lower profits according to the banks financial vice president jose humberto acosta for cemex the outlook was not better in the companys balance sheets it was seen that the net profit between july and september reached us   million decreasing  compared to the third quarter of  while earnings in the first nine months of the year reached us   million  less than in the same period last year while isa a company in the energy sector that reported operating income of   billion between january and september with a decrease of  compared to the same period in  when it accumulated   billion another of the companies that did not obtain the best results in the third cycle of  was grupo sura since the organization reported through the financial superintendency that at the end of the third quarter its net profit closed at   million which translated into in a drop of  according to the holding company these results are due mainly to the impact of the exchange difference as well as nonrecurring provisions registered in the first half of the year finally one of the results that were most expected due to the impact that the operation has had is that of avianca which did not feel strongly the unemployment of more than  days of the pilots attached to the colombian association of civil aviators acdac  this was concluded in its latest financial report for the end of september which showed that in the third quarter of the year the holding company achieved a net profit of us   million us   million higher than the same period last year third quarter results were driven to a greater extent by a  yearonyear increase in total operating income as the company benefited from higher traffic and higher occupancypromigas the stock that rose the most on the colombian stock exchange after the close of the day on thursday in the colombian stock exchange bvc promigas stock was the one that showed the best returns of the day at the close it gained  and its starting price was   with promigas it is the recovery that the asset has because the rebalancing the share reached   the market is paying an expensive share that if you see the book value of promigas is   that is three times more than which is at the moment  commented the president of franco group diego franco this title was followed by valorem which had a positive variation of  thus trading at   the third place went to the preferred stock of grupo sura as it managed to advance  and is now at   per share on the side of the securities that fell the most the one that contracted the most yesterday was preferential bbva colombia after having lost  of its value so the paper closed the negotiations for   another that also reduced its value was carton de colombia this time due to a negative variation of  its exit cost

preferred title of bancolombia appeared again which traded   million and grupo sura with   million finally in other indicators the main stock index of the bvc the colcap gained  remaining at  units it is a rebound driven by shares of grupo argos grupo sura in their ordinary securities and also the preferential ones in addition gdp data was known which outlines a better fourth quarter franco addedvalorem and grupo sura lead the increase in sales accumulated to september related article the government lowered its projection and estimates that gdp will grow by  in  although the economy is still not growing at the usual rate the third quarter of the year showed a better face some examples of this in addition to the  increase in gdp are the results that companies had at the end of september in the ranking by growth in annual sales valorem and grupo sura lead with increases of  and  respectively the compilation that to date has a list of  companies showed for example that the income of these companies already amounts to a little more than   billion without counting on odinsa and grupo mineros who have their consolidated reports pending while the groups profits amount to   billion the good news was led by valorem a group that brings together caracol television el espectador cine colombia and tiendas  among others because although its total revenues totaled   million the company obtained the first place in sales growth with a positive variation of  between january and september likewise his earnings totaled   million in the same period according to the company the media and entertainment segment represented the greatest boost to its revenues with a total of   million while logistics and transportation added   million which valorem described as a significant improvement in  going from   million in the same period last year grupo sura was also the bearer of good news at the end of september because although its profits fell  and the holding company closed with   trillion in profits the figure was not an obstacle for the group to occupy the second place in growth of income the contrasts jorge mario velasquez chairman of grupo argos we are pleased to present good results in this third quarter which are the result of the definition of a longterm strategy felipe bayon president of ecopetrol the results show a consolidation of the transformation program that we have which is focused on david bojanini president of grupo sura the operating results of our companies continue to be positive despite an economic environment of lower growth today we see the benefits of our geographic and industry diversification which allows us to maintain an optimistic perspective thus sura led by david bojanini reported revenues of   billion with a growth of  a figure that also left it in third place in sales amount only behind grupo exito which totaled   billion and ecopetrol which closed with   billion the higher revenues are due to the operating performance of the subsidiaries where sura asset management specialized in the pension savings and investment sector and suramericana in the insurance and trend and risk management sector continue to strengthen their competitive position in different countries explained the company in the report the colombian oil company ecopetrol did not disappoint neither the market nor its shareholders as it

interview the list was closed by the energy company canacol energy which between january and september had a  increase that allowed it to have revenues of   million despite the rise in sales its earnings closed down after falling  to   million apart from the growth in revenue the expectation also remained regarding aviancas results since on several occasions analysts assured that the cessation of activities of more than  unionized pilots would strongly hit the companys finances and the impact would come to light in this installment however the pilot strike only touched  days in september for which the company led by hernan rincon maintained the growth path between january and september and closed with   billion in revenue after growing  likewise its profits went from negative to add   million in the same period regarding the report the broker casa de bolsa said that the company released its results without strike effect and highlighted the performance of the main operating margins such as load factor which closed at  in the third quarter  the grupo argos report was also noteworthy taking into account that its president jorge mario velasquez highlighted the

colombia and abroad  assured ecopetrol president felipe bayon the results were announced by the bureau of ocean energy management boem the united states government entity in charge of assigning the areas and analyzing the offers presented in august  in the lease sale this award grants the two companies the right to explore these blocks for five years in a water depth of approximately  meterswith four more blocks ecopetrol is going for  barrels a day in the us in recent years ecopetrol has made a series of changes in its strategy both operational and commercial which has led the state oil company to seek new alternatives for production in order to maintain reserves within this new strategy the company has managed to expand its portfolio outside the country as is the case with ecopetrol america which won the award of four new blocks in the gulf of mexico in the united states by the bureau of ocean energy management boem where this subsidiary has a  stake the other  is held by repsol

blocks    and  at lease sale  according to the oil company this is an area where there are several platforms in which crude oil production is already carried out which will allow that in case these blocks are successful an early production can be started since the infrastructure already exists camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones explained that these are slow fields that take time in their oil tests capacity and with a positive future although he assured that ecopetrols priority is to buy fields or companies that already have proven reserves that is something that the market is beginning to take into account so the company should move in that direction for now ecopetrol america has achieved that its production soared  so far this year as it went from producing  barrels equivalent per day between january and september of last year to  barrels of oil equivalent each day in line with the projections of this company the success of ecopetrols subsidiary in the united states is thanks to the work of our technicians and the alliance with a partner like repsol with whom we have other exploratory projects in colombia and abroad according to bayon this growth is due to the entry into operation of the gunflint field during  in addition to the increase in the  field where ecopetrol has a  stake it is operated by anadarko and where it registered an increase in

units in a week in which positive results were presented from several companies listed on the colombian stock exchange such as grupo exito and avianca the colcap index the most representative of this stock market took a new breath and returned to close at  units after starting at  points on tuesday during the friday session the colcap had a positive variation of  and ended at  units  points above thursdays close grupo sura was the share that had the greatest advance during the session as it managed to appreciate  which led it to close at   after moving about   million another one that had an important advance was conconcreto since its title gained  and ended at   while bancolombias preferential had a positive variation of  to end the week at   per unit on the opposite shore was the role of promigas which was the stock that suffered the strongest negative variation of the day in such a way that at the close of the day the company lost  of its market capitalization and this led to its share trading at   although not so strong the spice of grupo bolivar also had a slight fall of  and culminated on friday at   finally corficolombiana fell  and closed at  the norwegian decision and the future of oil the oil boom in the north sea and in the scandinavian countries occurred as a consequence of the political crisis in the middle east in  when a barrel of crude oil went from us   to us   in the following years all the result of the great embargo that the main arab producers made on western consumers especially north americans since then the oil map has changed for better and for worse for the better other geopolitical players emerged in the sector such as norway and denmark who since then have enjoyed the honey of having oil but above all of knowing how to synchronize this primary wealth with savings and social investment before the crisis of the  norway was a smallgreat country dedicated to fishing logging among other activities almost forgotten outside the walls of the swedes and danes who had little or no game in the world international manufacturing or industrial agreement situation that changed between the  and  when the country emerged with great force as a model for the development of hydrocarbons since that time norway has invested the money from its oil and gas rent in a gigantic sovereign wealth fund estimated at about   billion making it a savings account unprecedented in human history last week the norwegian government surprised the world particularly the oilproducing countries by announcing that they will dismantle their oil and gas reserves in order to diversify investments a decision that does not mean anything else that will come out of these investments because it is not strategic for their future this can be understood in two ways one to truly diversify given the states dependence on fossil fuels two because they have studied that the oil business has entered an inevitable decline whatever the reason for the strategic decision the norwegians are telling the world that prepare for a lowcarbon future a news that in colombia should have a great impact because these days we celebrate that crude oil is returning due to times of good prices read above us   per barrel the norwegians fattened a sovereign fund that almost doubled the value of colombian gdp in times of fat cows now they see how the flow to the bottom is not the same and they want to find in the market new ways to keep it buoyant given that the fund is financed by government revenues from oil but one thing is denmark and another cundinamarca selling shares related to oil companies or public gazette as the bank of norway has done is not only a way to reduce exposure to oil prices but to take another path more akin to the new economy and the challenges of globalization this does not mean that colombia should draw all its strategic interests from companies such as ecopetrol or reficar since the social investment needs of the countries are different the size of the population is very different the degree of development is different competitiveness is another but above all trust in the rulers of the two countries is almost antagonistic colombia is still dependent on oil only this time it must do things rightvalorem gained  in the session of the colombian stock exchange valorem a business group that owns companies such as caracol television cromos el espectador or cine colombia was the share that appreciated the most in the first session of the week on the colombian stock exchange in such a way that in this case the title rose  which led it to settle at   per unit which represented an increase of   compared to the close of   on friday likewise it is worth mentioning that this paper was the most traded of the day since until  pm it managed to trade more than   million this positive behavior in the stock has been taking place since the company announced that it will have an extraordinary assembly to define whether to remove the title another of the securities that performed well in the colombian stock market was promigas since its share was priced at   that is a  increase compared to the previous closing while isa had an increase of  in its price and ended the session on monday at   on the other hand canacol energy was the one that had the strongest fall since its title lost  and culminated in   which is equivalent to

ended at   per unit the most traded papers in addition to valorem were the ecopetrol share  as it negotiated more than   million on the day the third was the bogota energy company  with which   million were traded although the colcap index only rose  it continues to maintain an upward trend after several business results thus it closed at  unitsecopetrol will invest  of its  budget in colombia the ecopetrol group announced that next year it will invest between us   billion and us   billion resources of which  will be allocated to projects in colombia with the focus on increasing reserves and increasing production in the continental territory on the other hand the remaining amount will be for the projects that the firm chaired by felipe bayon has in the united states mexico brazil and peru additionally the oil company revealed that  of those resources will be available for exploration and production activities with this framework the groups production is expected to grow in  and reach between  and  barrels of oil equivalent per day taking into account that about  pilot projects will be leveraged for the implementation of improved recovery technologies specifically the

associated with the shielding system lightning rod that the entity considered as noncompliance these breaches fall on the technical regulation of electrical installations in the facilities of the satellite battery in the putumayo development and production operations management another thing that the oil company announced was that in addition to complying with the payment of the penalty it has

after it made its first appearance on november   at  am that day it entered the stock market at   the action that has gone through golden and gray periods and today is one of the papers that is most traded every day to the point that it is part of the three colcap titles when the stock first hit the stock market ecopetrol came in from the top drawing attention on the day of its debut its negotiation was suspended due to a sharp rise in the price with only one hour in the bvc it achieved records as sales of  titles at   after  minutes quiet another strong demand appeared this time for  million shares at   which held it until the next day to date investors who bought  years ago in the first issue taking into account that ecopetrol paid dividends until  according to data from alianza valores have received earnings between   and   per year per share therefore the total during this decade could be   achieved that is they have already recovered the investment made in  those who are not calm with the price of the share are those who bought the papers of the oil company in  since that year sales were made at   today the stock is   according to fridays closing they have lost by title they still have to wait longer to recoup the investment explained camilo thomas analyst at alianza valores the contrasts diego franco president of franco group next year there are good winds for the colombian economy it is already believed that growth may be better than in  and for the stock market the losses returned again on account of international oil prices since  it began to be seen between   and   but its most drastic low reached   on january   thanks to the wti falling to   finally the president of franco group diego franco pointed out that for next year better results are expected due to investments in exploration and production of crude oil in addition the recovery of the stock will be due to a stability in oil prices next year will have a more encouraging outlook for the oil industry after two years of crisis due to the sharp drop in international oil prices which reached below us   a barrel the hydrocarbon sector is beginning to see signs of recovery and remains optimistic for next year when a good volume of investments is expected especially in exploration and production the crisis was originated mainly by the precipitous fall in crude prices which averaged close to us   a barrel but from one moment to the next dropped to us   for this reason the best prices seen in  between us   and us   per barrel have given the industry a break at least that is what the minister of mines and energy german arce stated the oil industry enters a period of recovery thanks to better prices in international markets but also because companies are now more strengthened by the savings and efficiency plans undertaken in recent years to face the situation he said to colprensa arce is aware that although prices have shown a recovery and stabilization so far this year it cannot be said that this period of bonanza has returned however he was emphatic in stating that the conditions are in place to increase the exploration and production of crude oil in the country without giving up capital discipline and the path of efficiencies for his part the president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet julio cesar vera agreed with the statements of the minister of mines and energy by ensuring that colombia was not immune to the general crisis that was experienced in the world with the fall in international oil prices leaving companies bankrupt unemployment and of course the fall in exploration activity vera assured that  has been a year of transition after the strong crisis with indicators showing significant growth especially in exploration where we are going to reach about  wells the manager also highlighted that colombia managed to maintain production above  barrels per day the latest report from the ministry of mines and energy with data from the national hydrocarbons agency anh indicated that during october of this year a crude oil production of  barrels per day was achieved registering a growth of  compared to september and  compared to the same month of  i believe that globally this crisis has hit bottom and the companies that managed to overcome it have already managed to get ahead and have returned to their fundamentals said the president of acipet this time highlighted the good performance of other indicators that reveal the optimism of the sector regarding what is coming next year in turn the executive president of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol german espinosa added to the optimism and stated that although the market continues to be volatile we are in a stable equilibrium band so we started to see signs of recovery both globally and in colombia where we have been growing in drilling rigs for  months  according to the figures revealed by campetrol during the expo oil  gas  fair which was held this week in corferias the drills in operation continued during october the growing trajectory that they have been presenting since april of the previous year reaching  equipment which reflects a growth of  equipment compared to the same month of  in relation to the function of the drills of the  equipment in existence consolidated for the month of october  were used for drilling work of which  were reported as contracted and  in operation for the past month  drilling rigs were reported in operation the campetrol report said it also highlighted the growth of the gdp of the hydrocarbons sector for the third quarter of the year which stood at  in contrast to the  observed the previous year which represents the first positive growth since september of  and consolidates the recovery process evidenced by the sector in this  in addition it showed that so far this year a total of  exploratory wells were registered in contrast to the  wells for the same period of  which they surpass the figures of wells explored during the whole of last year which amounted to  and signify a compliance percentage of  compared to the goal of  wells set by the anh for the end of  investment these figures unquestionably show an improvement in the sectors indicators but neither can victory be claimed there is still an important point and that is that next year the investment plans of the companies will be consolidated specifically the state ecopetrol which a few days ago announced an ambitious plan focused on exploration and production arce explained that ecopetrol plans to make investments of between us   and us   million in  which represents an increase of between  and  compared to  with this at least  development wells will be drilled  more that this year that is definitely a symptom that the worst of the crisis has passed and today we are ready to start a growth phase he said meanwhile the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon assured that he is optimistic about the future of the sector since it can be much better because we see a path of recovery and growth the manager stressed during expo oil  gas  that one must be cautious in each of the steps that are taken in the next few months in the sector espinosa for his part stressed that ecopetrols announcement is very important especially because it will emphasize exploration and production for next year perhaps the most important thing about the announcements is that at least  of the plan is going to be invested in colombia they are also going to bet on the refining of crude which will be in the order of  barrels per day he said for vera the fundamental thing is that it manages to consolidate those investment budgets which could mean more than us   million and that will be closely linked to the national government assuming great leadership according to the projections of experts the price of a barrel of oil for next year should remain between us   and us   for the national governments calculations in  a brent reference price of us   is expected for the end of  an average price of us   is expected ending the year with november and december at levels of us   a barrel what causes although it is true that the indicators show signs of recovery an issue that worries the sector and the national government itself is that of selfsufficiency as the president of acipet explained colombia is in a scenario of possible loss in approximately  years next year due to international prices many of the reserves that were taken from the companies in a lowprice scenario will possibly be included and that may give us a better overview but definitely colombia if it has to make quick decisions such as those that it has been promoting to guarantee that we do not lose selfsufficiency said vera for minister german arce as of december   colombia has a level of proven  crude oil reserves of  million barrels which include a volume of condensates of  million barrels and the next cut will be received in the month of april  so you must wait to know how the reservations are after this year the national government is on the eve of publishing the regulation of article  of law  of  on structural tax reform to access a new incentive called cert for the increase of those investments in exploration and production that are above the investments currently committed and in order to increase the countrys proven reserves which are those that allow the increase in production in the shortest term said arce the head of the minas portfolio pointed out that it is pertinent to work and increase production levels and increase reserves by encouraging the development of offshore projects exploration and production of unconventional deposits and improved recovery with the development of these three policies we are confident that we can continue to contribute to ensuring selfsufficiency in the medium and long term he said another point of concern has to do with the popular consultations that have been taking place in the country to stop the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in the country there is a critical scenario that has to do with the entire internal phenomenon that is generating this prevention and can generate a risk in terms of investments said the president of acipet for minister arce this is also one of the issues of greatest concern to the national government due to the misinformation that in popular consultations has been transmitted to the population impacting on the future of the mining and energy sector different actors have turned the popular consultations into an emotional debate that based on lies tries to stop the development of oil activity which has given so many benefits to the different regions of the country said arce while highlighting that the industry between royalties taxes and dividends has provided the country with resources for more than   billion between  and  finally the minister of mines and energy pointed out that from the government we are working on achieving participatory spaces in the development of the oil projects and the realization of socialization campaigns in order that the benefits and the economic and social benefits generated by the miningenergy activities are recognized in the different regions of our country ecopetrol celebrates its first  years on the colombian stock

january and may remained with a share at   but with the fall of lehman brothers it went through a correction that returned it to    despite the panic in the united states in colombia people perceived the volatility but it did not scare the primary issue so they kept a prudent price added thomas in  the title was lifted again and achieved the highest peak up to that point after the effect of the crisis had passed it was added that the federal reserve began to lower interest rates with a rise in crude oil to levels of us   per barrel in the wti reference this gave shares to   but the highest level ecopetrol has seen in the last decade was in  the oil boom led to the negotiation of us   per barrel the papers touched   per unit the losses returned again on account of international oil

resumption of the discussion of tax reform in the united states the dollar began to fall against a wide basket of international currencies including the euro and the pound sterling however compared to the colombian peso the us currency managed to recover some of the ground it lost in the last eight days since it went from   to open the week at   thus at the close of the session on monday the dollar

which yielded an average amount of us   per operation although the highest of the day was made for us   million internationally it seems that the markets are not particularly positive on the dollar unless we see some progress this week in tax reform or higher inflation numbers vassili serebriakov of credit agricole told reuters in ny as for oil days before the meeting of the producers cartel crude was operating stable in such a way that around  pm brent was trading over us   per barrel which represented an increase of  in its price however on the side of the west texas intermediate benchmark the price dropped  to us   due to a  rise in the production of the commodity in the united states since  valorem rose   in the bvc during the first negotiation of the week in the colombian stock exchange the valorem share which has been in a bullish streak was the one that was most traded on the day increasing its value by  which led her to end the day at   other shares that performed well during the day were celsia  which closed at   and ecopetrol  which also continues to recover and is already at   per share it is worth mentioning that the role of the oil company was the most negotiated of the session after moving more than   million another of those that had strong activity was the share of compania de electricidad de tulua  since it reached a transaction of   million finally it is worth mentioning that the colcap had a negative variation of  which led it to close at  unitsfinance minister raised the sale of participation in cenit in the next government the minister of finance mauricio cardenas during the celebration of ecopetrols  years on the stock market suggested that the next government could sell a percentage of the nations stake in cenit which belongs to ecopetrol and is in charge of logistics and the transport of hydrocarbons the nation does not necessarily have to keep  of cenit it can keep a little less as it has today in isa it is important that the nation is controlling that it is the majority shareholder i mention it as a suggestion of a source of additional income for investment plans of the next government said cardenas likewise the head of the treasury portfolio indicated that in the future the company may be attractive to investors so it would be interesting to register that company in the stock exchange so that current shareholders are left with two shares those of ecopetrol and cenit  according to the minister cenit is in a very good moment cenit has already stabilized it is a company that provides transport and logistics services to ecopetrol and other oil companies it already has its own plant equipment administration it is an independent company said cardenas it is important to remember that cenit was formed in  in order to manage its parents transportation assets which include the ocensa pipelines oleoducto de los llanos oleoducto bicentenario obc and oleoducto de colombiacenit the transport and logistics company contributes  of ecopetrols profits during the  celebration of ecopetrols listing on the stock market the minister of finance mauricio cardenas suggested as a source of additional income for investment plans of the next government the sale of shares of cenit a transportation and logistics company of hydrocarbons that belongs to the state oil company it is a company that can be very attractive for investors who have an interest in the transportation sector which is low risk very predictable and stable it would be interesting to register that company on the stock exchange  assured the minister if the results report for the third quarter is taken into account cenit obtained   billion in profits  of what was registered by the ecopetrol group which was   billion this shows that transportation has been a great cash generator and that this company is a strategic asset his assets are even valued at   billion the investment plan of us   million to us   million is absolutely financed with the resources that ecopetrol has and with the cash generated by our operations this means that we do not have to go to the banks or issue bonds or get into debt and we will not have to sell assets either said felipe bayon president of ecopetrol given the possibility of the sale of cenit cardenas pointed out that for example the current shareholders of ecopetrol could be left with two shares in cenit and in ecopetrol we had a work plan to be able to separate from cenit but it has taken a little more time cenit has already stabilized it has its own plant equipment administration is an independent company tomorrow we can split explained the minister of financeecopetrols role in the stock market on november  it was  years since ecopetrol began to be listed on the colombian stock exchange one of the most important events in the countrys economic history since since that month of  investors saw in the shares of the joint oil company an opportunity to get your moneys worth and so things were that first issue seduced half a million natural and legal persons who supported the operation the years passed and the oil hangover arrived and those   per share invested began to get dizzy evaporating its value there were periods of good profitability such as in  when the value of ecopetrol rose to   registering returns above  whoever sold at that time achieved good results and did not hold on to the prospective dividends for the years to come ecopetrol also issued bonds for   trillion and   million for  years each  and  an unprecedented successful operation that has contributed to the strength of the market and has helped change the perception of the stock market during this decade the joint venture has distributed dividends for   billion of which   billion have been for the nation and   billion for natural and legal persons an achievement difficult to achieve again and that speaks of the solidity of the oil company and the good functioning of the system another story is told by investors who bought papers  years ago in the first issue especially considering that only dividends were delivered until last year but have received earnings between   and   per year per share those who bought in  tell another story the shares were sold at   and yesterdays close was   clearly they have lost their bet on equities the dark days of ecopetrols action began after the  global crisis that hit stock markets around the world and colombias was no exception during the first half of that year the stock was worth   after the bankruptcy of lehman brothers the value was corrected downward and reached   the worst decision at the time was to sell and join the stock market stampede in  things changed thanks to the fact that a barrel of oil reached a maximum of us   a situation that shot the paper to   rising in  to   in its highest peak in the history of ecopetrols shares those who had invested in the first issue earned high returns even those who did so in  repeating the lesson that whoever waits wins in midaugust  lean cows returned due to international oil prices and from   it fell to   until registering its lowest level on january   when the market registered papers at   since a barrel of oil did not reach us   now things are starting to improve and the lessons are given its about equities and you cant expect the oil companys shares to rise steadily the secondary market shows in its history when to enter and when to exit it is not fixed income and there are more investment alternatives but ecopetrol has played the most important role in the colombian stock exchange and today represents about  of operations with subtractions and with additions its role in the colombian secondary market has been very goodisa ecopetrol and celsia the biggest rises of the bvc in  the performance of the main colombian companies in the colombian stock exchange bvc during this year has been quite positive the colcap basket grew  at the end of november  with isa ecopetrol and celsia the titles that increased the most so far this year these grew   and  respectively this year has been relatively good and with positive news such as isa empresa de energia de bogota or celsia whose valuations are equal to or greater than  said daniel escobar director of globals strategy department securities behind it there are also bvc shares which increased  eeb which gained  bancolombia which appreciated  banco de bogota with an increase of  and grupo nutresa with  in this jairo agudelo bancolombias equity manager agreed as of friday november  about  of the companies had a positive performance in the bvc he addedfrom a country with oil to an oil one the history of oil in colombia will turn a century in  and through the last  years a relationship of love and hate has been established the love of state finances towards this income and overtones of hatred in some oil regions towards this energy exploitation it is a bittersweet relationship that makes colombia a country with oil and not an oil country it is not a play on words it is not the same to be an oil company and focus the bulk of its exploitation and resource management strategies derived from crude oil to improve finances and develop the economy based on these revenues as is the case of several countries belonging to opec saudi arabia or those that extract in the north sea norway than to states such as venezuela or nigeria that depend highly on the fluctuations in the price of this primary good colombia is simply a country with oil that has established a love and hate relationship with oil for  years of love when great finds such as the cusiana cupiagua or rubiales were made in past decades and of hatred when the money obtained from the sale of the energy resource was wasted on badly invested royalties but the worst thing was that the economy depended on these revenues in an accentuated dutch disease never declared now is the time to highlight that after the precipitous drop in crude oil prices in august  what happened to the collection account to the oildependent economies colombia came out well off and has managed to overcome the budget gap left by the revenues via crude that never reached the state coffers now almost four years after the flow of oil dollars has been closed things are beginning to improve in terms of price and production and colombia must learn the lesson that it is not the same to be a country with oil than with oil it is essential to plan this new cycle in which the extraction of crude oil has entered a fat cow that is not yet clearly visible but that are real in the opec countries since the control over the production of crude oil by the producing countries it has depleted inventories and raised prices a kind of minibail that we cannot again spend on white elephants much less on twohanded hands off in very poorly structured royalties in terms of sumptuous or unnecessary works the oil cartel agreed last thursday to extend production cuts until the end of  news that will make the last year of the current government breathe easy the cuts began just a year ago and the end of  has been good for oil demand the commercial inventories of the oecd countries had fallen to only  million barrels more than the moving average of the last five years  and had used up more than half of the previous excess production the cuts have helped drive brent prices more than  this year  hopefully colombia has learned the oil lesson awareness of the evils that the dutch disease generates on the productive map and that oil and politicking is the worst cocktail in the regions we cannot forget that the economic country squandered the last great boom in works that never camegrupo aval shares fell  on the stock market in the second session of the week on the colombian stock exchange grupo avals stock was the one that fell the most as the financial groups title closed the day at   per unit which

the bvc appreciated  and reached  units regarding the colir the indicator appreciated  to  unitsthe new cartagena refinery passed the global performance test the new refinery in cartagena successfully completed the global performance test that was carried out for  days which was completed on december  with an average load of  thousand barrels per day ecopetrol reported in a statement during the two

benefits for the industry and the regional and national economies the estimated ebitda for  is at least   billion pesos we colombians should be proud of having an asset that will continue to drive colombias economy and industrial development while helping to improve air quality boost exports and guarantee greater energy security for the country said the president of reficar amaury de la

diesel lower in sulfur and more environmentally friendly environment in the first nine months of the year its sales exceeded   billionthe el condor share was the one that rose the most on the trading

gain  and close at  units the highest level of the last five weeks during the day the most valued share was valores simesa which appreciated  and closed at   per share another of the outstanding papers was that of ecopetrol which gained  and climbed to   this behavior was due to the announcement of the oil company to pay in advance several credits abroad similarly the preferred shares  and ordinary  of bancolombia were among those that appreciated the most on the day followed by the preferred of grupo sura  meanwhile it is worth mentioning that in addition these were the most traded

stable   sp believes that these companies do not they will be able to pass a stress test for sovereign default therefore if a sovereigns foreign currency defaults there is a high probability that these companies will also default explained camilo silva manager of valora inversiones in banking establishments the first affected were banco de bogota and bancolombia which also underwent a new review by sp and due to the effect of the sovereign downgrade of colombia remained at bb colombian assets would mitigate the blow due to a rating downgrade thanks to global liquidity the reductions in credit ratings suffered by companies and banks in colombia by standard  poors will make their indebtedness more expensive but the renewed global appetite for risky assets will cushion the impact in the short term sp downgraded colombias rating to bbb from bbb on monday due to a weakening economy weak fiscal performance and difficulties in reducing deficits facing the government as is often the case after a move in the sovereign debt rating shortly thereafter the agency cut the notes of the countrys main companies to the same level such as the oil company ecopetrol power companies isa and isagen the investment holding gruposura and the producer of processed foods nutresa in addition it lowered the ratings of bancolombia and banco de bogota to bb  or speculative grade after the announcement the peso depreciated  to its lowest level in a month meanwhile the stock index fell  and the domestic public debt suffered devaluation even though the markets had discounted part of the news companies are always anchored to the sovereign rating of the country where they exercise their production capacity it is something negative and the market operates as such said camilo thomas senior analyst at alianza brokerage but with the current general risk appetite those assets are not going to be as penalized as they would have been in a moment of aversion as we had in previous years so that mitigates the effect of the rating he added s  ps decision comes at a time when the economy is going through a deceleration phase which has been reflected in lower domestic consumption and therefore lower profits for the financial sector and some companies for juan david ballen chief economist of casa de bolsa although the financing rates of both the government and the corporate sector will be higher they will not overflow there is so much liquidity worldwide that investors will continue to buy because the yields here are still better than in other countries in the world and the country is still safe he said the benchmark  colombian market security the tes maturing in  traded on tuesday at a yield of  compared to  of the corresponding benchmark of the united states treasuryin  hours oil reached the highs of  and closed down again the last  hours for oil have been among the most volatile of the quarter on monday afternoon international oil prices had reached us   in the brent reference and us   in a wtitype barrel but at the end of tuesday it went through a correction that brought the former to levels of us   and second of us   the highs had not been seen since  when brent was trading on average at us   and wti at us   the strong upward movements according to reuters reports were due to the closure of the pipeline that carries  barrels of oil from the north sea the pipeline had been in reduced operations for four days and the market expected it to quickly return to operation which is why it was surprised by the temporary closure at the time john kilduff head of statistics at the commodities observatory again capital llc said that this is a significant amount of crude in a market that has been tight so the rebound in crude prices was normal when reviewing the price growth in the last year wti and brent have registered increases of  and  respectively experts have pointed out that the rise has been the result of production cuts promoted by opec member countries and by external exporters such as russia which have been in force since the beginning of the year in addition to technical problems with the north sea pipeline the strongest prices last week also came due to problems in another key pipeline for the american union less than a month ago the keystone pipeline cut cut canadas crude supply to the united states by nearly  and west texas a barrel responded with increases of between   and   regarding the most recent falls worldwide the energy information administration eia one of the entities that tracks the prices and sales of crude in the united states reduced its projections for the growth of world demand for  in  barrels per day as there are no more opec meetings this year this is one of the indicators that generated low prices at the international level during the last day among the points that may represent strength before the end of december there are two reports of inventories in the united states for example today it is expected that there will be a fall of  million barrels a week ago inventories had dropped  million and the market estimated that they were  million finally it should be remembered that this week according to analysts consulted by this newspaper the price of wti is expected to average us   a price in line with inventories in the northern countrystandard  poors rating led the dollar to rise in colombia by   after standard  poors modified colombias rating from bbb to bbb tes rates began to increase and this was the main factor in the devaluation of the peso against the dollar at the end of

devaluation of the local currency was moderate for some analysts at the close of the day the colombian peso fell  while the brazilian real did so at a rate of  due to possible delays in the pension reform sought there and mexico  due to technical levels in the markets as franco group president diego franco observed the operators had the sp rating issue digested months ago some assets were already trading as if colombia were bbb but last day the large flows which are those that are traded not in shares but are normally made in public debt securities were the ones that began to react by sales medium that is to say that there were capital outflows franco pointed out however the analyst added that this was an effect that was seen in the early hours of the day the devaluation stopped after  am because there was a considerable flow of sales in tes even due to that pause in nervousness the dollar it stopped rising and the rise was not great  and although the exchange rate price moved mainly due to the sp effect the last meeting of the year of the federal reserve began yesterday so the market is anticipating the decisions that this entity may make in terms of interest rates interest for next year in addition to this it is expected that a new rate increase of up to  basis points will be made official so that rates in the united states would remain moving between  and  today after hearing janet yellens last speech as fed chairwoman she will give us the updated economic outlook with guidance on what they think  will be in terms of interest rates three moments of

of mines and energy this represents a fall of  if compared to the figure reported in the same month of the previous year where  were reached according to data issued by the national hydrocarbons agency anh so far this year the average production is over  barrels per day this would keep production above the finance ministrys mediumterm fiscal framework target of  barrels a day gas production for november reached  million cubic feet per day according to anh reports for orlando santiago manager of fenix valor the figure reported in november does not have any significant repercussions for the sector because the variation registered against the previous year is less than  in the average production of the year even the figure is at levels similar to the previous ones so there is no evidence of a slowdown this slight drop could be due to situations that occurred in ecopetrols oil fields and public order incidents during the first days of november for this reason it is expected that with the progress of the agreements with the eln the attacks will be reduced and that the production in december will remain very similar to that presented in the previous month added santiago

la cirainfantas lisama and colorado fields as well as the proximity to the barrancabermeja refinery all this production transportation and refining infrastructure is less than  kilometers away this new finding shows that we are on the right track in our goal of increasing reserves we are satisfied with the results of this alliance with parex which confirms the potential of the department of santander in the heart of our industry where oil production began almost a century ago  stated the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon pardo  is ecopetrols fourth discovery in the national territory this year the other three are  also in the middle magdalena valley purple  and  in deep waters of the colombian caribbeanwith  ecopetrol adds four finds in the national territory in  ecopetrol

according to company reports the crude found is more liquid and lighter than colombian heavy oil being between  and  degrees api this good news is not only for ecopetrol given that the exploratory project is owned  by parex a company with which the de mares block is shared with the crude found synergies and competitive advantages can be ensured in this area of the country due to the installed capacity and operation of the la cira  infantas lisama and colorado fields in addition due to its proximity to the production and transportation infrastructure of the barrancabermeja refinery which is only  kilometers away for felipe bayon president of ecopetrol the new finding shows that the company is on the right track in the objective of increasing reserves we are satisfied with the results of this alliance with parex which confirms the potential of santander in the heart of our industry where oil production began almost a century ago he said the other three discoveries of the company that have occurred this year in colombian territory have been  also located in the middle magdalena valley purple  and  both in deep waters of the national caribbean orlando velandia president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh affirmed that the discovery of oil in the  well is good news for the country the reactivation we have achieved is not only seen in the exploratory activities but also in the percentage of success we have had of every three wells we drilled this year we are finding crude in one  this is a success rate much higher than the historical ones registered and that will help to extend the countrys oil selfsufficiencythe most mentioned companies in lr articles in the last year bancolombia avianca and ecopetrol were the companies most mentioned in the articles of la republica lr in  this conclusion was reached when reviewing the lr indicator of published news which registered references from  organizations in the  editions that were made in the year the indicator is calculated by adding the number of times the company appears in the lr index that appears every day on the back cover thus bancolombia was the protagonist in  publications thanks to its investments in technology and the movement of its shares on the stock market for example in a september publication it was reported that the banks title was one of the most valued so far this year and in another of the same month it appeared as one of the most traded shares on the stock market the company also made digital developments such as a robot that tells clients registered in valores bancolombia where they should spend their money to this is added the investment of us   million in digital security avianca was second in the count with  mentions the strike of pilots of the colombian association of civil aviators was the situation that most influenced the appearance of avianca in the newspaper since since september  they began to talk about the impact on the company and on air consumption but this was not the only mention there was also the alliance with united and kingslands demand to avoid the union facts that were registered in the first months of the year although avianca faced several adversities this year it also had several achievements such as transporting pope francis during his visit to colombia and signing a codeshare agreement with air china and singapore airlines according to raul avila an industry expert the economic implications of the pilots strike were very strong especially in the movement and development of the holiday season in third place on the list was ecopetrol for this company  was a year of recovery and change juan carlos echeverry gave the presidency to felipe bayon additionally the company opened a subsidiary in mexico under the name of ecp hidrocarburos mexico sa and reached five discoveries in the national territory which represents an increase in reserves in the banking sector corporations such as bbva banco de bogota and colpatria also appeared in the top  each of them with mentions on topics such as technological investment innovation new financial products and social responsibility programs in the technological area are apple amazon uber facebook and twitter with more than  mentions which places this industry as one of the most newsworthy the case of amazon is one of the most relevant since the company has diversified its businesses it boosted its operation of films and series with which it won two oscars bought the supermarket chain whole foods launched artificial intelligence services among others to this is added that its ceo jeff bezos this year became the richest man in the world other companies that appeared in the ranking of the  most referenced were odebrecht due to the corruption scandals that revolve around the firm it was followed by exito which made progress in the textile segment its own brands and store openings uber due to the controversy of its illegality and cine colombia and procolombia with sustainability plans and investment news it should be noted that unions and universities provide a large number of mentions because they are the most consulted institutions as sources for information analysis the contrasts raul avila industry expert bancolombia is one of the largest banks belonging to grupo empresarial antioqueno and its movements in central american markets give it greater visibility  related article the  businesses that companies starred in this year the most important businesses in  the companies most referenced in lr articles do not always coincide with those that made the most relevant moves of the year the list of the largest businesses is led by grupo energia bogota with an investment of us   million followed by brookfield asset management with the acquisition of gas natural for us   million promigas with an amount of us   million in the creation of a subsidiary in peru and hilton which allocated us   million to open the conrad cartagenacementos argos share was the one that rose the most on tuesday on the colombian stock exchange this tuesday on the colombian stock exchange bvc according to records of the listings of the shares that rose the most the role of cementos argos was the one with the highest yields after it grew  and its starting price ended at   then terpel appeared with an increase of  thus remaining at   while icolcap came to third place which grew  with a close at   among the titles that fell the most on the day that of el condor suffered the greatest falls falling  and ending at a price of   other securities with considerable negative variations were the bvc which lost  remaining at   and etb which decreased  to   the best traded shares on tuesday were preferred bancolombia with movements of   million then ecopetrol with   million and in third place grupo argos which managed to trade operations for   million finally in the indicators the main stock index of the colombian stock market the colcap remained stable with a slight growth of  and thus closed at  units the movement was minimal it was something that the market was waiting for due to the votes of president donald trumps tax reform the appetite for risky assets and stock trading decreased explained alianza valores analyst camilo thomasecopetrols stock traded above   after  months after  months ecopetrols stock was again above   the last time that the title of the largest company in the country was above these levels was on may   the day on which its closing price on the colombian stock exchange was   per unit the considerable increase in the international price of brent benchmark oil which is currently around us   per barrel the reduction of the companys debt abroad and the good management of finances have been some of the factors that have led to the recovery of the value of the title by  so far this year in the trading session on thursday it closed at   per share on the bvc which represents an increase of  compared to the opening value it is worth mentioning that during the day these papers managed to negotiate more than   million in this sense camilo silva founder of valora inversiones stated that there are several points that have influenced the rise in the price of ecopetrols share one of them is the price of crude oil which allows all oil companies to improve their income with the same production  in the same way the analyst highlighted the expectations that the market has regarding the companys reserves and the exploration carried out in the country the contrasts natalia granados global securities analyst what we see with the rise in the price of ecopetrols share is that it is a movement that is not related to important news or trading volumes on the contrary natalia granados an analyst at global securities affirmed that the most probable thing is that the title will end the year around   however the next year it may be over   again because it believes that there is no compelling reason that led to the appreciation of the paper what we see is that it is a movement that is not related to fundamental news that is pressing that rise or to trading volumes so it is likely that the stock will fall to   explained granados who added that the extension opecs production cut pact is already discounted which will not have a strong impact on the market colcap index rose  due to the good performance of ecopetrols paper the most important index on the stock exchange advanced  to  units it is worth noting that among the most valued shares of the day is canacol energy which rose  and closed at   on the contrary the title that fell the most on the day was that of empresa de energia de bogota which lost  and ended at  the resurrection of the price of a barrel of oil to us   the price of oil has reached figures that were not forecast for the short term last december and with the rise above us   for brent there are already analysts who expect a second annual increase the projections average us   for  the most optimistic reach us   and the least such as citigroup us   an opportune moment in colombia when the industry celebrates  years in the territory with the beginning of the exploitation of infantas dos in barrancabermeja with the production of  barrels per day this  could thus become a second wind after difficult years in which investments fell to us   million from a maximum of us   in  the calculations of the colombian petroleum association in its study of trends of investment they point out that oil companies can complete investments in exploration and production next year for us   billion this if prices remain above us   and include capital in deferred projects from  us   million for natural gas us   million for primary recovery and exploration focused on land in terms of new deposits there is some expectation for large discoveries in previously explored areas in this new century drilling in colombia according to the acp will continue to be concentrated in the same basins as in previous years with slight changes such as the drilling of a third of all wells in the llanos while previously this basin concentrated twothirds parts activity will increase in putumayo where there are expectations of larger discoveries than what has been registered lately and the focus will return to magdalena in this case specifically the lower magdalena valley vim where there is an expectation of finding gas says the report the contrasts francisco jose lloreda executive president of the aacp all the companies mentioned concern about the popular consultations with current prices over us   it is also likely that there will be investment in more expensive projects including some not executed this year due to budget cuts such as heavy crude oil and some technologies to increase recovery that require pilot testing now the eyes for these promises to be fulfilled are on the commitments of opec organization of petroleum exporting countries and on us producers this because the last serious commitment of the cartel was the one that led for example goldman sachs group inc to raise its forecast for the benchmark brent crude almost  to us   per barrel the other side is the one seen by citigroup inc which sees a risk that the current upward supply and demand dynamics will run out of momentum and that an increase in shale oil production in the united states could scare the market the probabilities for a very pronounced decline are the same less and with the prices of the most pessimistic us   the same in colombia the acp projects investments of at least us   which would represent a growth of  which would lead to a stable production of  barrels per day on average above the governments goals the projected investment figures are positive news especially after two consecutive years of slowdown in investment in the hydrocarbons sector however we cannot claim victory or neglect the operational environment for the industry on which a large part of the budget execution for next year will depend concluded francisco jose lloreda mera president of the acp the manager also pointed out that beyond prices a factor that oil companies have learned to handle from the low to about us   per barrel with high efficiencies which is important for more than  of companies in defining operating plans it is geological potential fiscal and contractual aspects and social issuespeso rises due to the rise in crude oil the stock market falls due to the financial sector the peso rose on wednesday driven by the rise in

arauca and boyaca these violent actions cause serious and often irreversible damage to the countrys ecosystems and affect the safety of workers in the industry we express our solidarity with the affected communities and acknowledge ecopetrol and the public force for their timely attention to the emergency the union added through a statementcolcap lost  and closed the day at  units after rising for several days at the beginning of the year the colcap index the most important on the colombian stock exchange fell again for the second day in a row thus the basket of shares lost  to  units this decrease was mainly due to the sharp drop in the price of ecopetrols share since it fell  and ended the day at   per unit after reaching levels of   at the beginning a week and had earnings of   per share so far this year it is worth mentioning that the oil company was also the most traded during the day since it managed to move more than   million seven times more than the second most traded which was the bancolombia preferential another title that did not have a good day was the canacol energy species which had a fall of more than  and culminated in   on the other hand the most valued share during the day on the stock market was that of banco de occidente with a growth of  to settle at   in addition grupo bolivars papers rose  and closed at levels of  brent is at a  high and is trading close to   a barrel january couldnt get off to a better start for oil in the  days that have passed this year international prices have not stopped growing and at this time both the brent benchmark and the west texas intermediate are at levels that have not been seen in the market since december of  compliance with the pact to cut production in the member countries of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec the decline in oil inventories in the united states and the forecast of greater demand for global crude oil have made raw material prices in london reach  highs and stand at us   while the wti is trading around us   per barrel in view of the sharp decline in us crude inventories and unprecedented compliance with opec production cuts market players are convinced that the market continues to adjust analyst carsten fritsch told reuters of commerzbank so far this year brent oil has gained about us   since it started  at levels of us   and in the opinion of orlando santiago manager of fenix valor the trend will continue at least in the first part of the year as the market is reaching a breakeven point of over us   per barrel in the same sense it is happening with the prices of the united states reference since it is settling very close to us   which is the equilibrium price that the market expects for the raw material said the analyst other analysts assured that a downward variation in crude prices can be observed during the second semester mainly because the cuts in oil production by opec member states will end although the situation in the united states where despite high prices production remains low it could sustain prices santiago said it is worth remembering that exactly two years ago the london benchmark prices touched their historical lows reaching prices of us   per unit mainly due to the excess supply that production in the united states was causing at that time these prices remained low for most of  and it was not until last year that they began to return to levels above us   per barrel however since the fourth quarter of  analysts have been observing a stabilization in the price of crude which kept it above us   brent and us   wti at the end of the yearthe illusion of oil at good prices the year that begins brought a huge respite to the national coffers with the price of oil at levels not reached for several years a barrel of crude is priced in international markets at us   a figure above those estimated by the national government in the mediumterm fiscal framework and by those projected in ecopetrols revenues both estimated at us   it is undoubtedly great economic news since it is no secret to anyone that this raw material continues to be the backbone of income since august  international prices have fallen to very low levels out of balance with the governments cash flow and directly undermining investment capacity this drop in income became the great headache for our economy as it had to revise down not only the general budget but also the percentages of economic growth for these years it was a tragic event for the economy which has been managed with a certain degree of effectiveness by the economic authorities however the episode served to demonstrate that the economic country was under the impact of the socalled dutch disease during the last recorded oil boom between  and well into the second decade of this century which is silently adjusting its first  years two things to keep in mind the fall in oil prices was not so tragic for colombia as it happened in other emerging countries here it has been known  until now  to get around the situation preventing this tragedy from becoming the tip of the iceberg of a new longterm economic crisis second the economic structure of the country continues to be oil dependent even the national coffers derive their maximum sustenance from crude exports and we maintain a dangerous dependence on this changing product there is no wellstructured and credible plan in sight from the national government to replace this chronic dependency in conclusion we remain in the grip of an economy nervous about oil adjusted by the swings in the prices of brent and wti todays oil panorama must be viewed from these two points of view the price of a barrel of oil a year ago was us   while the price of the last few days is us   this difference of us   is the one that is marking the change of direction of the income that is expected to be maintained throughout  it is the highest price in the last three years and has to do with the fall in crude inventories from the united states by  million barrels and with opecs commitment to production cuts although they are politically powerful reasons the country can do nothing so that the conditions are maintained over time this new year comes with plenty for the oil sector that had gone through a long period of lean cows a situation that took the toll on the countrys growth now the ball is in the hands of the oil companies that should begin to reactivate their drilling and hopefully that this psychological goal of production of one million barrels a day is sustained for the good of investors and even more so for the national coffers the issue of how to stop depending on this adjustment up on oil will always be raised but that will be a good matter for the presidential campaignthe eln attack generated an oil spill in the guisa river south of narino the national army reported that the trasandino pipeline was once again the target of attacks this time due to an attack attributed to the eln members of that guerrilla group on the night of saturday january  arrived at the providencia village in the municipality of ricaurte south of the department of narino to commit the crime at  pm information is received from the community about an explosion apparently it would be the installation of an improvised explosive device in the transandino pipeline an action attributed to the jose luis cabrera ruales company of the eln said the first army report at the time of the attack the pipeline was operating which immediately led to an oil spill in the guisa river which is responsible for supplying water to at least five municipalities in the area ecopetrol directly pointed out the attack affected  inhabitants of the sector however it should be noted that the effects could be seen in up to  people in ricaurte the oil company reported that immediately the fact was known the suspension and closure of the pumping through the pipeline was ordered personnel entered to clean the area and begin the repairoil would end the year us   above the us   forecast by the government with the update of the financial plan for  revealed by the ministry of finance the government armed its fiscal accounts with a brent oil price of us   per barrel which it considered to be conservative figures this observation seems to be true if one takes into account that in the first days of this year a barrel of crude from the north sea has traded on average at us   while the wti has done so at close to us   quite a lot above government estimates and with the possibility of staying at least us   above those estimates according to some analysts consulted by lr there is the possibility that in the first half of the year the high prices of crude oil will remain with a decrease in the second half of the year although according to some experts it could remain between us   and us   throughout  sergio olarte director of macroeconomic research at btg pactual highlighted that a virtuous circle is being fulfilled that creates the conditions for high crude some of these factors have to do with a stabilization in the production of unconventionals in the united states to prevent prices from falling in the future and the sustained agreement of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec not to increase production this would allow the government to guarantee higher revenues in two ways on the one hand the taxes of the oil companies will be higher for  with important effects on ecopetrol which despite the discounts on the brent with which it exports would see higher income with which it would pay not only more taxes but also more profits for the nation and for shareholders in fact the minister of finance mauricio cardenas explained that each dollar of increase in the price of oil represents a year later tax revenues of   million which will be reflected in finances and income for  for the president of the colombian petroleum association acp francisco lloreda this is good news while he pointed out that one of the countrys priorities should be to increase investment in exploration which this year is estimated to be between us   million and us   million to guarantee the replacement of reserves  however lloreda like other market analysts considered that thinking that the current price level is sustainable in the rest of the year is premature because it precisely corresponds to critical situations for this reason other experts believe that although prices will be higher than projected by the government the difference will not be so high the contrasts francisco lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association the increase in oil prices seen in recent months is good news for the industry however to think that the current price level is sustainable is still premature  juan pablo espinosa manager of economic research at bancolombia in  the government deficit will adjust and this rise in the price of oil may contribute to making the effort not easier but it may be more bearable the reasons for the rise are many global growth is occurring everywhere especially in developed countries that are already growing above potential as well as a lag as a financial asset he said although there are other variables that they lead you to think that the price is going to go back in this same sense and with a more conservative stance juan pablo espinosa manager of economic investigations at bancolombia considered that the forecasts can be adjusted a bit upwards but this rise at this time will be difficult to maintain for year for now analysts have not modified their forecasts waiting for the evolution of prices oil at  levels one of the events that have stood out the most in recent days has to do with the time it took for oil to return to profitability levels for companies as highlighted by a report by banco de bogota it has been in prices comparable to those observed at the end of  which represents a panorama of stability for oil companies which will be able to obtain if these levels are maintained the possibility of making higher investments for exploration and productionthere have been five attacks against ecopetrols infrastructure so far in  with the end of the bilateral ceasefire with the eln guerrilla one of the most affected has been ecopetrols infrastructure and in this sense the surrounding communities and environment the cano limoncovenas pipeline suffered three attacks in cubara boyaca and saravena arauca while the trasandino had one in mallana narino there was also an attack on a line near the cupiagua well in aguazul casanare according to figures from the oil company there were  attacks last year of which  were against the cano limoncovenas pipeline as a result of the attacks the pipeline was out of operation for  days which meant that the country stopped producing around  million barrels to this must be added the kidnapping of rafael riano managing contractor of ismocol the company in charge of the maintenance and repairs of the cano limoncovenas and cano limonsamore pipeline german espinosa executive president of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol a union to which ismocol is affiliated rejected the kidnapping and demanded the immediate release of the contractorthe price of oil rises while stocks stagnate oil prices in the international market after several days still remain at threeyear highs which under normal conditions would trigger the shares of any company that works with this raw material however the shares of ecopetrol and to a certain extent canacol energy have not had such behavior since  began the price of the brent benchmark has been rising steadily thus during the first days it reached levels of us   per barrel in the second week it was already close to us   and by  pm it had already exceeded us   to reach levels of us   data that they had not been presented since december  that is  months therefore analysts have assured that there are some explanations that can help understand what the situation of these titles is the first has to do with confidence on the part of investors after the end of the bilateral ceasefire with the eln this guerrilla has carried out several attacks against the countrys oil structure which in the opinion of juliana pinzon an equity analyst at corficolombiana ends up temporarily distancing people from the sector  another fundamental point at least in the price of the papers of the company directed by felipe bayon is that it has reached expensive levels in relative terms while on december  of last year a barrel of the london reference was at us   the ecopetrol title reached   a month later crude oil has appreciated  while the species has done it  it even reached a maximum of   although in recent days it has fallen back until it reached slightly above   it should also be remembered that the oil company is still pending to report its financial results for  in which the profit is expected to be close to   billion   billion above the   billion that was reported in  according to an analysis by casa de bolsa the stock is in a congestion zone that ranges between   and   its break to the upside will depend on whether brent oil is capable of exceeding us   with sufficient strength which can take it around   in the opposite case if the oil makes a false and tends to the drop it can lead to the profit taking that would take it to a second floor around   several analysts expect that due to the extension of the opec agreement and the increase in demand for crude above supply oil prices will remain at these levels at least until the middle of the year in the second semester it is possible to observe a drop in international prices for now pinzon indicated that the trend of the stock is neutral although with a downward perspective since it reached a maximum point and can continue to correct this week the recommended ones from colcap a report from the casa de bolsa firm indicated that in the next  months there are five recommended shares to invest due to the appreciation they will have in this period the winner for the commission agent of grupo aval is the species of empresa de energia de bogota since its value is expected to grow at least  which would take its price from   to   the contrasts juan david ballen brokerage firm analyst within the next  months there are five recommended shares to invest in the bvc among which the eeb stands out juliana pinzon corficolombiana analyst at the moment ecopetrols share is a bit expensive in relative terms for investors its trend is down  juan david ballen research director of the commission agent indicated that in the case of grupo energia de bogota the explanation is due to the fact that with a solid presence in the region through its portfolio of assets focused on electricity and gas they allow you to have exposure to sectors with stable demand and regulated rates other recommended securities are those of nutresa grupo argos and exito gas natural was the most valued of the day on the stock exchange the most valued share during the day on the colombian stock exchange was that of gas natural which rose  up to   per unit on the contrary the security that fell the most was the preference of corficolombiana with a decrease of  for which it closed over   the most traded species of the day was ecopetrol  which managed to move   million the colcap index for its part increased  to  pointsoil production in  was  barrels per day and fell  the ministry of mines and energy reported that oil production during  was  barrels of crude per day which meant a decrease of  compared to  when it was  according to the entity this level remained above the estimate of the mediumterm fiscal framework established at  barrels of crude per day in the case of gas it stood at  million cubic feet per day a drop of  during december  the average crude oil production was  barrels per day which meant an increase of  compared to november  and  higher than the same month of  the production of december gas was  mcfd showing a  drop compared to the previous november and a  growth compared to december in  oil production would be up to  barrels per day the ministry of mines and energy announced that at the end of  colombian oil production reached  barrels per day that is a fall of  if compared to the  barrels per day produced on average during  a fall that however for analysts speaks of the recovery of the sector and the stability that the industry has been demonstrating that is why some experts already have their projections for oil production in  ready the president of the colombian petroleum association acp francisco lloreda assured that this year about  barrels per day on average could be expected if the conditions exist necessary in the territory to be able to produce it with a barrel above us   the market gives a great push but the increase in prices is more temporary than structural according to lloreda so the call in  is for the sector to be more competitive regardless of the behavior of international prices as the winter in the northern hemisphere passes the demand for crude oil is going to drop a bit and that could drive the price down added the manager explaining that one of the reasons why the value of the barrel is recovering its values it is thanks to the high demand that is taking place due to the strong winters in the united states and europe for his part camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones stated that within the current context of the world market the production report for december   barrels per day is a good figure because nine months are completed with stability in production the range in which it is being produced does not fall below  or  barrels said silva which gives an average range of stability also highly motivated by the peace process the tankers learned to adapt to the market and stabilize that is why the december production is the highest in a year and a half  added the expert for silva crude oil prices in recent months already promise a good  because it is expected that they will not be below us   as large analysts such as goldman sachs or jpmorgan have already been projecting more is being produced above the estimated price which promises better and greater investments necessary for the sector said the analyst however alejandro martinez former president of the acp considered that  was a complicated year in which there was a reduction so with the recovery of prices in an optimistic scenario the  production could become the same obtained at the end of last year i do not think an increase can be achieved because in mature fields these possibilities are not very high he added additionally he pointed out that the decrease in exploratory activity which does not seem to be reactivated is even more worrying due to recurring obstacles such as legal uncertainty and constant attacks the contrasts francisco lloreda president of the acp it is essential to be more competitive and review the tax burden because if it continues like this it will not be easy to attract capital in the coming years gas production was  mpcd national gas production in  was  million cubic feet per day mpcd the ministry of mines and energy also revealed that during december  mcfd were reached which represented a  fall compared to november  and an increase of  compared to the same month of  the minister german arce has insisted that colombia should bet on

rallies of the state oil companies of colombia and brazil are set to end in anticipation of this years uncertain elections says hsbc ecopetrol sas  return and petroleo brasileiro sas  return far exceeded that of their peers in the last six months according to analysts at hsbc but the elections will be a key factor in the valuation of the actions and while the bank remains optimistic for both countries there is also the possibility that the candidate who wins the brazilian elections may move away from reformist policies while in colombia it persists high uncertainty about the fiscal strategy of the next government while we see the recent positive results in share prices justified we now see a limited rise in petrobras share prices and small downside risks to ecopetrols share price analysts wrote in the report headed by lilyanna yang a best  has already been taken into account in the price as a result petrobras was downgraded from buy to hold while ecopetrol was downgraded from hold to reduce despite an increase in the target of  to us   per adr the highest of any analyst tracked by bloomberg positive aspects such as a higher price of brent crude investment discipline and new partnerships are already reflected in target prices and the market according to the report however it is not all bad news a bullish oil price scenario with brent above us   a barrel would favor ecopetrol where the cash flow from refinery and upstream operations has a stronger correlation with the oil prices and the rise from unconventional sources would become more visible for petrobras there are potential shortterm catalysts around the transfer of rights and plans to sell assetswith the boost from crude oil prices ecopetrols capitalization reached   billion after brent oil prices reached us   per barrel ecopetrols shares on the colombian stock exchange reached levels of   per unit which led the company to reach a market capitalization of   billion in the last two days ecopetrols share has appreciated  on the stock exchange while on the new york stock exchange it has advanced  in the last year the price of the oil companys securities are the highest since november  at the opening of the day on the bvc ecopetrol advanced  and was trading at  ecopetrols action as a thermometer the history of the colombian stock exchange may well have two transcendental moments the first when the three stock exchange centers were merged into one in  and two when the state oil company ecopetrol registered its role in the local secondary market at   these are two events that are among the most important in business economic history in the last six decades and since then the stock market and the ecopetrol share have woven a kind of parallel history due to the weight of the oil value in the local market indices if the stock rises or has a regular behavior the local secondary market does well and inevitably deteriorates when the stock loses price as happened in recent years when the oil price crisis hit the economies dependent on the oil market  passing the collection account to growth now since december  of last year the price of a barrel of oil has risen to us   this new reality has caused more expensive crude to be sold the stock rises and the happy faces return both in ecopetrol and in the government this new panorama is transferred to the half million natural and legal persons who have shares who see the fat cows coming this year in an expected dividend so far this year the share price has risen almost  reaching a price of   a value that had not been seen since october  just when it was beginning to fall the same situation is experienced with the adr on wall street where it has risen  reaching a price of us   that rise has made value paper one of the most sought after equity options at the start of this year in terms of market capitalization the good price has caused ecopetrols stock market value to go from   billion in november  when it was just celebrating its  years at the bvc to   billion in the last few days this optimistic context causes shareholders to ask other questions as if there is a possibility of distributing dividends again it is clear that investors acquire securities when they have an expectation of receiving more money for their investment in equities and one way to increase profits is through dividends which in recent years have not been delivered or have been very scarce ecopetrols stock market value has doubled in less than a year and that has to do with the price of oil in international markets but also due to its internal restructuring policies undertaken in its last administrations its board of directors now without direct members of the government by mandate of the oecd must be prudent not to believe the story that we are an oil country and that the joint venture has regained its role as a dairy cow in public finances the history of the recent crisis should give us some learning and that is that in good times it is necessary to save to return to the list of the  largest companies in the world ecopetrol has to work on its efficiency reduce more costs and finetune its corporate governance hopefully we will not see the goose that lays the golden eggs in this emblematic company again it is just a large mixed state investment that should be a great support to the national coffers not its only source of incomeecopetrol share fell  on the colombian stock exchange this thursday on the colombian stock exchange bvc ecopetrols share suffered the sharpest drop after falling  to   then terpel

at   and culminated at   the minimum recorded was   and the maximum   although analysts expect the dollar to be below   next week a low exchange rate makes some stocks such as avianca grupo de energia de bogota geb cemex and ecopetrol attractive this is because for example in the case of geb the company was one of the most affected by the devaluation of the peso in  since its financial debts were almost  in foreign currency today about  of those liabilities remain in dollars and the weakening of the currency removes some of the outstanding burden in addition to the above the company authorized the administrators and collaborators to acquire shares within the framework of the first stage of the democratization process and more details on the sale of the papers will be known in the coming days avianca was also another hit with the devaluation of  today its financial statements are reported in dollars but the fact that the currency falls favors approximately  of the income that is in pesos so it would have an effect on shortterm results  explained omar suarez analyst at the brokerage casa de bolsa precisely the effect of income in pesos also benefits the role of cemex latam holdings more than  of what is invoiced comes in local currency which compensates for the exposure it has for income abroad added suarez the fourth security that generates interest with the state of the current exchange rate is ecopetrol although its reports in dollars and foreign income prevail with foreign currency the dollaroil relationship feels in its favor the high prices of crude oil offset those registered with the currency it must be remembered that just as the us currency has also fallen the oil reached threeyear peaks explained alianza valores equity analyst camilo thomas

gasnova said that last year marked a milestone for the sector since the national supply of this hydrocarbons was not enough to serve the national market which implied imports by private companies in that sense within the projections for the current year martinez indicated that ecopetrol is expected to supply  of the national lpg supply the rest of the offer will be covered by other national producers and through imports which are estimated to be  of national sales in the first half of the year imports are necessary but they are not the basic solution that the country requires to guarantee the total supply of the demand for this fuel in the different regions of colombia that is why it is necessary to increase the national supply of lpg in the short term mainly by ecopetrol a company that has the greatest potential to increase it for the home public service  stated martinez how was the consumption of liquefied petroleum gas lpg according to martinez most of the consumers were users in the residential sector using cylinders the rest of the demand was in the industrial and commercial sectors the departments with the highest consumption of lpg in their order were antioquia narino santander valle cundinamarca and norte de santander out of a total of  departments that had the supply of this fuel in the country the president of the union also said that in the medium term there will be new national lpg production projects which will generate significant supply surpluses that will allow an increase in supply not only for the agricultural industrial and residential sectors but also for the automotive and the generation of electricitygolfo de morrosquillo will complete  artificial reefs thanks to the ecopetrol group with the launch of the third phase

generate income for the government we have been prudent but with those profits the dividends return ecopetrol denounced vandalism and sabotage in the meta production fields ecopetrol denounced that in the early hours of sunday the sabotage and vandalism against direct workers and contractors and in the companys infrastructure in acacias and castilla la nueva in the department of meta intensified according to the oil company through a press release hooded people entered the acacias and chichimene stations and the clusters of the castilla chichimene and  fields attacked about  workers and forced them to leave the facilities people started fires threw flying objects and blunt objects against the infrastructure a situation that put the safety of the personnel at risk because hydrocarbons are handled and stored in the facilities that require special security procedures ecopetrol explained that the company was forced to shut down all of the wells and suspend operations at the stations located in the mentioned municipalities the intimidation and violent acts extended to the workover and drilling equipment which forced the suspension of the programmed activities the company said in the communication ecopetrol rejected the threats to which workers in the castilla and chichimene fields continue to be victims as well as the violent actions that took place at dawn which have been brought to the attention of the competent authorities the company called on the regional authorities to exercise their constitutional function and guarantee the immediate restoration of public order

nervousness in global markets the dollar again lost ground against various currencies around the world mainly due to the rebound in international oil prices thus the colombian peso was one of the favored currencies of the day due to the correlation that exists with the raw material in the opening session of the week the dollar closed with an average price of   this represents   below the representative market rate trm which was   at this time analysts expect the currency to have a more stable behavior due to lower movements in world stock markets which are waiting for inflation data in the united states the minimum price on the setfx platform was   and the maximum occurred at the opening when it reached   during the day us   million were negotiated in  transactions which resulted in an average of us   per operation the opening price was   while the value with which it closed was   according to several analysts consulted by this medium this week the us currency would be trading on average at     more than in the survey two weeks ago the situation was similar for several currencies in the region such as the case of the peruvian currency which stopped a negative streak of several days and closed with a rise of  due to the global weakness of the dollar at the end of the operations the sol reached    units per dollar compared to    units registered on friday meanwhile the mexican peso was trading at  per dollar with an advance of  another factor that influenced this decline has to do with a recovery in us stocks after a strong selloff that caused the sp  to fall the most in more than two years according to reuters colcap rose  the colcap index of the stock exchange rose  and closed at  points the most valued share during the trading session on monday was gas natural which gained  and ended the day at   another of the species that ended the day in green numbers was the preferential one from cementos argos with an increase of  the share that fell the most was the preferential mineros which fell  to   the species most traded again was ecopetrol with   millionthe challenges of the oil industry are on the surface rather than underground the better oil prices and ecopetrols investments this year bring good expectations although with a fundamental challenge which is dialogue with the communities alberto consuegra president e of cenit a subsidiary of the oil company explained the strategy with the regions and their importance in the activity how do you see the current price outlook for ecopetrol we see the market very volatile we do not think much that we will have a bonanza in prices i ask for a lot of prudence about the price i feel that being between us   and us   is the ideal the volatility occurs because production in the united states continues to increase to the point that it reaches  million barrels a day and as there is more production from the united states opec will try to compete can that rivalry keep us on the line thats right so our bet is to be absolutely efficient the bulk of our products is heavy crude and in order to be profitable we need to be very efficient in extraction and transport our goal is to generate barrels that have a profitability after us   in may  a profitable barrel was us   we have been plotting transformation so that regardless of volatility we are sustainable are they today yes efficiency is tied to sustainability and for us to be moderately successful in  we have to make the environments favorable when you have heavy crude fields decline very fast and you have to look for new wells to replace production that is an execution challenge and there are the problems with the communities but if we manage to maintain production we generate wealth for the regions is this the most important challenge today yes of course that is the fundamental point today the biggest challenges of the industry are on the surface and not in the subsoil even more than in the foreign market how do you go about that the contrasts francisco lloreda pdte from the colombian petroleum association although there is an increase in investments  of this activity depends on the success of the regions hence the importance of trust what projects are coming ecopetrol is going to invest us   million in  compared with the investment levels of other companies it is a gigantic challenge in terms of the execution of resources in direct operation of ecopetrol it will be us   million in the large fields such as castilla chichimene apiai rubiales and magdalena medio and the rest of the resources with our partners there is direct investment in magdalena medio cira infanta as well as developments in huila and putumayo that is the amount of the whole group in the case of cenit it has already built the pipelines we are going to dedicate ourselves to maintaining the infrastructure with a budget of us   million what is the current pipeline network in oil pipelines we have about  kilometers and in the same way about  kilometers of pipelines we are talking about  kilometers in total in the countrys network compared to the pacific alliance is the national network large it is a robust network but looking at the oil infrastructure for example mexico surpasses us but chile does not have much and peru has developments in gas but little oilcolombian peso gained  due to global weakness of the dollar despite the fact that the inflation data in the united states for january  was  points above expectations which made the dollar rebound at the beginning of the day the retail sales figure below projections and the immediate fall in the stock markets raised doubts about the strength of the north american economy which means that the fed would not raise its rates quickly enough to counteract inflationary pressures thus in wednesdays session the us currency closed with an average price of   which represented a fall of   compared to the representative market rate trm which stood at   the opening price of the currency was   and its closing was   while the minimum price was   and us   million were negotiated in  transactions a similar situation was experienced in other countries in the region such as mexico and peru where the nuevo sol rose  and ended at    units per dollar while the mexican peso was trading at   with a gain of  in the neighboring country the rise in the currency was supported by an offer of dollars by companies before a tax payment period and by institutional investors due to the global weakness of the us currency in the country said reuters the same behavior was also seen in brazil the real rose  to  units per dollar and posted the highest daily gain since january  for their part brent oil prices which also helped drive the currency downward in the country rose  and closed at us   the wti benchmark also advanced  and closed at us   its highest price for the entire week this behavior occurred because crude inventories in the united states were below projections according to the energy information administration inventories last week reached  million barrels almost a million below analysts projectionsgases del caribe activated a contingency plan for the fire

rector yesterday when many were celebrating valentines day two ecopetrol wells located in the el triunfo sector in the aguazul municipality were affected by terrorist attacks according to the company at about  pm armed people entered the location of the liria yd and  wells in the cupiagua  recetor field and after removing the security personnel they proceeded to activate an explosive charge that caused the shutdown of both wells  in addition to rejecting the incident the company said in the statement that the activity in the wells continues to be suspended while the authorities verify the damage and safety conditionsin january  barrels of oil were produced in colombia per day average crude oil production during the month of january was  barrels per day this was announced on thursday by the ministry of mines and energy the portfolio also reported that there was a decrease of  compared to the same month last year and a drop of  compared to the production data for december although crude oil production was slightly below that presented in previous months the january data is good for the industry since it should be remembered that during the first month of the year international prices of raw materials reached levels not seen in several years reaching the brent reference barrel to exceed the barrier of us   and that of the wti reference us   in addition the level registered in the first month of the year remains above the  goal of the mediumterm fiscal framework which is  barrels per day according to minminas the reduction in production is mainly due to electrical and mechanical failures and scheduled maintenance in the guando pauto sur cupiagua florena bacano tigana and nashira norte fields in addition the different attacks against the oil infrastructure registered in january by armed groups outside the law taking this into account the february data could also show reductions taking into account the recent complaints that ecopetrol has been making about different acts of vandalism in several of its most important wells on the other hand the gas production figure in january  was  million cubic feet per day presenting a growth of  compared to january  and a decrease of  compared to the previous monthecopetrol reported attacks last night at two of its wells in casanare the oil company denounced in the last hours a new attack on its infrastructure the incident occurred at the end of thursday night when residents of the aguazul area casanare reported a detonation which affected two wells located in the el triunfo sector municipality around  pm armed people entered the location of the liria  and  wells in the cupiaguarecetor field after removing the security personnel they proceeded to activate an explosive charge that caused the shutdown of both wells ecopetrol explained the company acknowledged that as a precaution ecopetrol decided to close the wells while verifying the conditions in which the wells are located so far the authorities have not determined if they are eln militias for the moment oil company officials are evaluating the sector in the company of the public forceecopetrol denounced new attacks against metas oil infrastructure ecopetrol denounced that in the last hours the threats against its workers increased as well as the attacks against the oil infrastructure in the castilla and chichimene fields in meta a group of approximately  hooded people entered by force and attacked the acacias maneuvering center cma which is part of the electrical system of the castilla production field during the riot they broke glass cut the wiring seriously damaged the control equipment and electrical connections and caused a fire that affected the restoration of some wells the company said according to the company the protesters who were they mobilized on motorcycles cut trees to block the access roads to the fields sabotaged different points of the infrastructure burned electrical switches and manipulated some flanges at this time ecopetrol technicians accompanied by the public force are working to restore the fluid electricity in the field and thus continue with the process of normalizing the operation he explained finally the state oil company rejected these acts of violence that affect the integrity of the workers and the oil infrastructure and made a call to use dialogue as the only way to resolve differencesgrupo exito and isa are among the recommended actions for this semester related article grupo argos nutresa sura and bancolombia those recognized in the robecosam yearbook purchases investments and external factors such as the improvement in the price of oil allowed actions of companies such as ecopetrol isa bancolombia canacol and nutresa to lead the ranking of the securities with the highest appreciation in their market capitalization in the last six months on the colombian stock exchange bvc as stated by analysts consulted by lr the fact that ecopetrol was the action that led since it appreciated  and reached   billion had as its main factor the improvement in the price of oil following this line and taking into account the performance of each sector shares of companies such as grupo exito isa grupo energia bogota cementos argos cemex latam holdings avianca and ecopetrol itself are the bets that analysts are making for this semester german cristancho manager of economic and strategy research at davivienda stated that our top for this period is to bet on grupo energia bogota which is an interesting alternative due to the stability of the share and we believe that it may have a potential for appreciation of almost  including dividends  another of the bets are the actions of grupo exito taking into account that the consumer sector is gradually recovering according to cristancho the fact that consumption in colombia and brazil is going to recover is combined with lower financial expenses and taxes due to lower interest rates so we expect an increase in the groups profits from this year the contrasts camilo thomas analyst at alianza valores for these months we expect a bullish behavior in the stock market but the latent risk is that the treasures have not begun to demand them despite this uncertainty the specialists recommendations are avianca for the movements of the week and grupo aval not for appreciation but for less depreciation than the rest of the companies on the stock market on the other hand isa is an option since in addition to the benefit it had from receiving compensation and resources in brazil it is possible that with new auctions and power generation projects it will invest again finally the recent report by alianza valores highlights that the next rise in ecopetrol could be an opportunity to take profits now the share price would only exceed   if a barrel of brent rises above   as goldman sachs expects protection and terpel were the ones that increased the most at the close of friday in the bvc colcap appreciated  and ended the day at  units the shares that drove part of the rise were proteccion and terpel which closed the day with increases of  and  respectively the two companies benefited from the news that activated their operation on the day on the other hand those that fell the most were those of corficolombiana with a decrease of  to   and canacol that fell to   with a decrease of  despite the  drop ecopetrol closed the week at   and on the day it traded   millionecopetrol reserves amount to  million barrels of oil at the end of  the ecopetrol groups net proven reserves reached  million barrels of oil equivalent the reserve replacement rate was  and the average life of the reserves is  years the oil company announced today  of the proven reserves are owned by ecopetrol sa while ecopetrol america hocol and the stakes in equion and savia peru contribute  the average life of ecopetrol sa reserves is  years in  the ecopetrol group incorporated  million barrels of oil equivalent of proven reserves which represents a positive change in the trend of incorporation of reserves in recent years total accumulated production for the year was  million barrels of oil equivalent the reserves were estimated based on the standards and methodology of the securities and exchange commission sec of the united states  of the bookings were audited by the renowned independent specialist firms ryder scott company and degolyer and macnaughton regarding the sec price used for the valuation of the reserves in  this was us   per brent barrel compared to us   per brent barrel in  according to a statement ecopetrol estimates that due to the effect of the higher price of crude oil  approximately  million barrels of oil equivalent were recovered as a result of the extension of the economic limit of the fields and new projects on the other hand about  million barrels of oil equivalent are the product of technical management and financial optimization of assetsecopetrols proven reserves grew  and will last for  years one of the worst fears that oil tankers have expressed in recent years is the depletion of the countrys crude reserves for this reason it is a respite for the sector that ecopetrol closes its  reserves at  million barrels equivalent mbpe which means that they will last for  years when last year they spoke of only  years last year the ecopetrol group incorporated  mpbe of proven reserves which represents a positive change in the trend of incorporation of reserves in recent years total accumulated production for the year was  mbpe the oil company said in the statement this also means that for every barrel the oil company produced  barrels were replaced the contrasts mauricio cardenas minister of finance very good news from ecopetrol in terms of reserves more reserves were incorporated than were produced replacement was   camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones in addition to the recovery from barrel prices ecopetrol has managed to be more efficient these entry figures show that this year the reserves will rise even more  for the minister of finance mauricio cardenas this is very good news in terms of reserves more were incorporated than were produced the replacement was   it should be remembered that the reserve replacement rate is the highest in the last three years the company also added that  of the proven reserves are owned by ecopetrol sa while hocol ecopetrol america and the interests in equion and savia peru contributed  in this way the ecopetrol group has an average life in terms of reserves of  years sources close to the company indicated that this impulse was motivated by three reasons improved recovery projects technology and discoveries regarding the first ecopetrol highlighted that the increase in proven reserves by  mbpe is due to the results of the program to increase the recovery factor whose main achievements have been in fields such as chichimene castilla casabe and tibu this result is very satisfactory as it is one of the pillars of growth in reserves and production of the company ecopetrol highlighted likewise there is a higher price effect since according to the company this allowed approximately  mbpe to be recovered thanks to the extension of the economic limit of the fields and the incorporation of new projects likewise  mbpe are the product of the technical management and financial optimization of the assets for camilo silva founding partner of valora inversiones these figures break with the trend of falling reserves in recent years what used to punish them the hardest the price of a barrel today also helps them to recover thus the viability of taking advantage of the barrels they have increases silva said he added that they have managed to be a much more efficient company from the outset this news marks that this year it will allow it to increase reserves even moreon march  will be the general meeting of shareholders of ecopetrol the state oil company ecopetrol announced that on march  it will hold its annual shareholders meeting in which it will discuss various topics of interest to the company the first without a doubt will be the distribution of dividends as anticipated by the minister of finance mauricio cardenas who anticipated that this year after two periods the shareholders of the company would see income from their shares in addition two changes in the board of directors of the oil company will be discussed it is the nomination of carlos gustavo cano as main member by minority shareholders together with the nomination made by ecopetrol of hernando ramirez plazas shareholders who cannot attend the assembly may be represented by power of attorney granted in writing that meets the requirements established in article  of the commercial code said the oil company the assembly will be held from  am in corferiaswe cannot declare war on oil there are many politicians who aspire to the congress of the republic and the presidency of colombia who have declared war on oil a valid position in philosophical terms and effective in green times but absurd from the real economy and much more obtuse from the state finances oil continues to be the backbone of the local economy a reality that few like to hear but that is what we have and what we have not been able to change in a century of oil history lets look at the figures crude oil sales abroad represent  of the countrys total exports last year ecopetrol transferred   million to the state coffers and at its best  they reached   billion the share of the mixed company in the colombian stock exchange represents  of daily operations and has more than half a million shareholders who hold securities and what is nothing less the company listed on wall street makes annual investments of more than us   million an injection for the economy unmatched it is by far the most important economic activity in the country in recent decades not to mention all its social investment activity and job creation carried out by this sector for all the above it is absurd to propose an economy orphan of oil at least in the next five years the idea of decontrolling the economy may be viable in the long term and the desire that we replace the exploitation of crude oil with the use of viable solar energy but not now it is not the time to do it and it would be wrong to simply abandon exploitation of this resource for pure ideology we are terrified and scared by the situation of the venezuelan people who concentrated on oil to the detriment of their industrial network which succumbed in the midst of the chronic and irreparable dutch disease but there is also the opposite case of norway which has managed to manage its various oil boom very well by creating a sovereign fund that makes it one of the most successful and competitive countries today just as there are cases of failure in the oil world there are also some very successful ones ecopetrols reserves amounted to  million barrels an energy resource that leaves us alone for the next  or  years and that will allow us to reactivate a sector that has been important in recent decades but that we have not been able to exploit with efficiency or generational responsibility  these reserves increased by  million barrels and of that new amount  million were thanks to the increase in prices a situation that allowed the economic limit of the fields to be extended and the incorporation of stagnant projects this new reality has made the price used for the valuation of reserves in  to be us   per barrel of brent compared to us   for the same barrel a year earlier this totally optimistic context means that for every dollar that a barrel of crude rises the nation receives   million a not inconsiderable amount of money for a state with large social investment obligations and a huge backlog in infrastructure ecopetrols profits for the third quarter of  amounted to cop  trillion  more than the previous yearrise of us   in crude oil increases by  million barrels of ecopetrol reserves ecopetrol reported this week that its net proven reserves increased to  million barrels of oil equivalent boe increasing the average life of the reserves to  years the oil company estimates that due to a higher price per barrel approximately  million boe was added back to its books in other words for every dollar that the price of oil rose reserves increased  million barrels as a result of the us   that oil rose on average from  to  ecopetrol recovered reserves that with the  prices were not viable to be produced said julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of engineers of petroleos acipet according to an ecopetrol spokesperson the reserves do not depend solely on the international price of a barrel but also take into account new discoveries and recovery projects in fact  million boe of the increase in proven reserves is due to the results of the recovery factor increase program the main achievements of which have been in the chichimene castilla casabe and tibu fields at ecopetrol we view international crude prices with great caution because there is a lot of volatility the company must concentrate on being efficient in the use of resources by applying strict capital discipline said ecopetrol president felipe bayon according to diego franco president of franco group although in the market there are those who handle the theory that the price of oil will reach us   he considers that the brent will be around us   and the wti around us   prices will not increase any more because the demand for oil is not enough to supply the excess supply and the plan to reduce crude production by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec will not work if the united states does not do it he part  he explained the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol today we are able to make a profit with a brent of us   per barrel when two years ago we needed about us   per barrel diego franco president of franco group the price of a barrel has been high because it suits the oil company saudi aramco which will go public in the second half of the year maybe prices will go down after that  likewise vera agrees that the price of brent will be between us   and us   unless a specific geopolitical situation arises that could change this in this regard bayon said that ecopetrol has made efforts to be profitable at lower prices today we are able to make a profit with a brent of us   per barrel when two years ago we needed about us   per barrel concluded the president of the oil company oil sector operating costs according to figures from the colombian petroleum association acp in  the operating cost for oil production in colombia was us   per barrel on average the total cost decreased  compared to the average in  the extraction value was us   per barrel which includes lifting costs administration costs and associated with the processing of crude oil regarding transportation the cost is us   per barrel and represents  of the operating valuethe market expects the companies ecopetrol and exito to lead in growth in results today begins the cycle of publication of business results for  of the largest companies in the country the projections for the fourth quarter in most cases show a trend similar to that presented last year for the third quarter explained analysts from various commission agents at casa de bolsa they expect financial results for the fourth quarter to be relatively similar to those recorded in the previous period amid a slight improvement in economic conditions in colombia with the oil and utilities sector leading the positive part of the balance  due to higher oil prices and good water conditions the agenda begins today with reports from avianca bancolombia grupo argos and exito on the grupo argos side the holdings income is expected to be   billion according to an analysis by corredores davivienda in addition this share is expected to have a dividend of   that is  higher than that registered in the same period of the previous year according to estimates by alianza valores on the other hand expectations for grupo exito from which revenues of   billion are expected remain neutral this due to the fact that the operation in brazil will continue to recover and in the local market there would be a quarterly increase of  in sales the same report said in relation to this for the consumer and retail sector it is expected that the end of the year season will

economic research at corredores davivienda as for nutresa which would have a dividend of   per share a quarterly improvement in the companys sales volumes is expected especially in cookies chocolates

while the net profit could reach   million with an increase of  carlos rodriguez director of variable income at ultraserfinco explained that in the energy sector the average market prices for the fourth quarter of    kwh are slightly lower than those reported in the same period of    due to the atypical rainy season that colombia has experienced in the last part of the year however the amounts traded on the stock market were higher  now most of the market will be attentive to the financial results of ecopetrol the second largest company in the country by revenue regarding the oil company which would be presenting its report on march  the increase in crude prices is expected to boost the companys quarterly revenues to   billion  more than in  the increase in the price of brent during the last quarter of the year it will be the main variable to boost the companys income while production will remain unchanged at  barrels per day  said cristancho the contrasts carlos rodriguez director of equities at ultraserfinco if the colcap index is taken into account business results are expected to be good mainly due to ecopetrols numbers german cristancho director of economic studies at corredores davivienda the increase in the price of brent during the last quarter will be the main variable to boost ecopetrols income in the same sense casa de bolsas analysis expects that the variation in the price of oil will favor the results of the oil company added to the already known effects in terms of operational efficiencies and product improvements which have allowed it to have superlative margins in the last few quarters in the financial sector the outlook was not so favorable because they will continue to be pressured downwards due to a deterioration in the quality of the portfolio and higher spending on provisions related to specific clients such as electricaribe and sitp according to the groups commission agent endorsement likewise slow economic performance can also influence the statements of financial institutions neutral results are expected from grupo aval with a net profit of   million in the quarter which represents an increase of  in the last three months for next month deliveries from other companies are scheduled such as terpel march  with sales of   billion in this period bank of bogota  and grupo energia de bogota  from which quarterly revenues are projected for   million which is a growth of  compared to the same period of the previous year if the colcap index is taken into account business results are expected to be good said carlos rodriguez from ultraserfinco although he explained that this is mainly due to ecopetrols numbers the shares preferred by the market in the most recent financial opinion survey published by fedesarrollo the four shares considered most attractive by analysts within those that make up the colcap index are grupo exito with a preference expressed by  of those who invest in stocks this is followed by the shares of celsia empresa de energia de bogota eeb and the preferential of bancolombia in the last month there is a greater appetite of those surveyed for the energy financial and consumer sectorsecopetrol decided to suspend its operating contracts in the department of meta due to the disturbances and blockades that have occurred in the meta ecopetrol decided to suspend  operating contracts for two of its fields in that department castilla and chichimene the decision directly affects the employment of  people in the region who are linked to the companys work in meta through a statement ecopetrol announced that a group of oil company workers conducting a round of wells in the northern part of the castilla field was surprised by hooded protesters who tried to attack them in addition the protesters set fire to a palm plantation and burned variators and electrical transformers in  production wells nine of them located in three clusters in the northern area of the castilla field and three in cluster  of the chichimene fieldthere are  barrels at risk in the meta the production of around  barrels of oil equivalent per day is at risk as a result of the attacks against ecopetrol workers and facilities in the meta department as the oil company was forced to suspend  contracts in that region this amount is approximately  of the daily oil production in the country if the barrels that are stopped being produced are not supplied in new fields the blow to public finances will be strong said jose roberto acosta professor at cesa likewise the minister of mines and energy german arce considers that the impact of this measure on the economy is associated with the postponement of the extraction of barrels all the barrels that cannot be produced due to public order problems are exports that are not made or imply a lower load in the refinery which not only hits ecopetrols income but also the income from royalties of the municipalities and prosecutors of the nation additionally they could put the supply of fuel at risk  mentioned the minister the fields affected by this contingency plan are castilla where on average between january and september of last year  barrels of oil equivalent per day were produced and chichimene a field in which the first nine months of  an average of  barrels were extracted of oil equivalents per day suspended contracts are divided into workover and maintenance the former refer to when a well is damaged and a small drill must be brought to fix it to when an intervention must be made to open another area of interest or to isolate an area that already has a lot of water production on the other hand maintenance contracts are for surface work with equipment separators treaters and tanks among others these maintenance can be scheduled and corrective ecopetrol suspended these contracts after hooded men tried to attack a group of workers from the oil company that was conducting a round of wells in the northern part of the castilla field in addition in five private areas near this field hooded men set fire to various crops the contrasts german arce minister of mines and energy all the barrels that cannot be produced due to violent acts are exports that are not made or a lower load in the refinery likewise sabotage and burning of electric drives and transformers were reported in  production wells nine of them located in three clusters in the northern zone of the castilla field and three in cluster  of the chichimene field with all these attacks the one that loses is the country since fewer resources are allocated for social investment and development in the regions said orlando velandia sepulveda president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh the union of oil workers of colombia utenh also rejected the violent acts since as a result of the suspension of ecopetrol contracts  people will be left without work and the economic and social development in the region will be affectedecopetrol will present results on february  on february  after the market closes ecopetrol will publish its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of  as well as for the full year this was indicated by the company through a statement to the financial superintendency where it also indicated that the board of directors approved last years financial statements the next day that is february  will be the results conferences in both english and spanish it should be remembered that the minister of finance mauricio cardenas when the results of the first semester were known pointed out that at the end of the year the profit figure could approach   billion between january and june  profits reached   trillionmininterior affirms that it put an end to blockades in castilla la nueva meta the ministry of the interior reported that after a negotiation session with inhabitants of the communities of acacias and castilla who were protesting against the involvement of foreign personnel in the area of operation and production by ecopetrol sa they reached an agreement to stop the road blocks and access to the san isidro de chichimene field the negotiation was carried out by the vice minister of the interior hector olimpo espinosa and the local authorities of the municipality of castilla la nueva the ministry official said that he showed the protesters the governments willingness to seek solutions to the needs of these populations and respect for social protest however he called for no de facto avenues given since they affect the rights of those who do not participate in it and to give continuity to the progress made they created a monitoring committee and working subcommittees a couple of days ago ecopetrol had made the decision to suspend  operating contracts for two of its fields in meta due to the intensification of the riots and blockades in the last hours while a group of workers carried out a round of wells in the northern area of campo castilla they were surprised by hooded protesters who tried to attack them while esmad squads protected them the company saidlatin companies that reign in the us stock market impact in the us market has always been presented as the challenge of large latin american companies in search of expansion according to bloomberg data compiled by lr among the top  companies in the region with the largest market capitalization on the worlds main stock exchange brazilian companies reign while at the local level ecopetrol is the only colombian that appears to be in position  the colombian oil company registers an upward variation in its capitalization of  since the beginning of the year and until tuesday of last week which is worth the fifth place among the companies on the list with the highest growth in percentage being surpassed by the brazilian banco do brasil sa  petrobras  itau  and the mexican grupo financiero banorte  this growth of ecopetrol is reflected in an increase of us   million in its value between january  and february  the contrasts cesar ferrari professor of economics ecopetrol must remain efficient in a market that depends a lot on international prices and global crises luis carlos reyes professor of the department of economics universidad javeriana currently i dont think there is any colombian company with a profile to to enter the us stock market apart from those that already exist it is not surprising that in the ranking of the first  companies that belong to the banking sector stand out such as itau banco bradesco sa banco santander brasil banco do brasil sa credicorp banco de chile and banorte all the companies in the sector present positive numbers in the percentage of variation in their capitalization compared to the record at the beginning of the year and if they were added together they would present a growth of us   million despite the uncertainty that has been generated in recent weeks by the fall of the new york stock market the results support the present of the american economy in the trump administration since the president won the elections in november  the stock markets have set a record  opportunities and the dow jones has gained  in value even the latter reached  records in that period in this regard reyes assures that the trump administration has made a big mistake in attributing itself to the profits that the stock market has had during its first year because when the stock market falls it will have to assume full responsibility for the fluctuations of an indicator over which in reality he has almost no control  for its part ferrari advises that the us stock market is a crystal ball many say that what happened is due to a recovery in levels because they had risen a lot but investors express concern about the economic outlook american  of the  latin american companies listed in the ranking only two have a percentage deficit of their market capitalization value the chilean chemical and mining society which occupies box  presents a decrease of  equivalent to us   million while the retail marketer walmart de mexico located in position seven presents  with a loss value of us   million the list is led by brazilian companies and ferrari explained that the economy of brazil and its companies are much larger than those of the colombian economy but they face much more serious political and economic crises than those of our country so their stock market values have very different dynamics  thus considering the difficulty of comparing the economies of the regionecopetrol closed  with earnings of   billion the highest in recent years ecopetrol announced today that it closed last year with a net profit of   billion the highest profit in the last four years according to the oil companys statement net profit was  higher than that registered in  with a brent price  lower finance minister mauricio cardenas highlighted that another important aspect for the markets is that ecopetrol last year reduced its external debt from us   million to us   million the company with a price last year that was us   per barrel is giving more or less the same profits that it was giving in  when the price was above us   per barrel a great job product of effort and commitment  likewise average production amounted to  boed reaching the companys goal despite the attacks against cano limon and the blockade that stopped crude oil production at la cira infantas for  days as for last years proven reserves these amount to  million barrels equivalent ecopetrol also announced that the average life increased to  years and that the reserve replacement rate was  the oil company also highlights that during  the highest average load was reached in the refining of colombia since with the operation of the two refineries  barrels per day were reachedanh confirms the discovery of three wells in the departments of santander and arauca in an official statement the national hydrocarbons agency anh announced that two months after the  anniversary of the oil industry in the country three new discoveries of crude oil were confirmed in santander and arauca the companies in charge of reporting these findings were ecopetrol and occidental when they reported that the discoveries were in the infantas  wells between  and  meters deep whose tests yielded more than  barrels per day  api degree department of arauca the wells cosecha  about  meters deep and rex  at a depth of  meters also registered a discovery of crude oil specifically in the municipality of arauquita as reported in the official statement orlando velandia sepulveda the president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh affirmed every finding is good news for the country as it will result in royalties jobs and social development of the communities this is the result of the effort we make in the last two years to reactivate the exploration that is reflected today in the confirmation of new findings  in this regard ecopetrol announced through a statement that the three wells tested the presence of light crude and in the tests recorded a production of more than  barrels per day these three findings show that oil activity is being revitalized in two of the most traditional departments for this industry in colombia while ratifying the benefits of the alliance between ecopetrol and occidental which began in the early eighties with the discovery of the cano limon field  stated felipe bayon pardo president of ecopetrol the oil company also highlighted that the rex  well is currently producing an average of  barrels per day of light oil with a gravity of  degrees api this crude has a greater appreciation in the international market and its transportation is easierin  ecopetrol achieved profits of   billion and grew  compared to  yesterday afternoon ecopetrol presented its results for  in them the state company reported a net profit of   billion  above of its  earnings which stood at   trillion likewise the companys operating profit was   billion almost double the   billion from the previous year in addition last year ecopetrol produced  barrels per day boe compared to the  boe that were extracted in  the president of the company felipe bayon indicated in the presentation of the report that  was a year of great achievements operational and financial for ecopetrol today we are a more efficient and disciplined company we demonstrate our technical capacity and resilience by having emerged stronger from the crisis of low oil prices  the oil companys ebitda stood at   trillion ebitda margin of  thanks to an appreciation of close to  in the brent oil benchmark which benefited the companys income as explained in the analysis made by alianza valores omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa explained that the ebitda margin behaved very in line with the last three months where it stood at  the expectations that these commission agents had for the annual profit were that it would be between   billion and   billion total sales of the oil company were located at   billion which represented a growth of  compared to  when sales of   billion were registered of these  boe corresponded to local sales while foreign sales amounted to  boe with a total volume of  boe despite the good numbers there was a reduction in the savings that the company had been presenting ecopetrols cost reduction is already much more limited they have implemented an important policy in reducing costs and expenses renegotiation of contracts and greater efficiencies with this they have been generating a positive impact on financial results however clearly that is what has been happening since    said suarez the contrasts german cristancho director of economic research at corredores davivienda the main reason for the rebound for the last quarter is the price production was practically unchanged we expected it to be  barrels carlos rodriguez director of variable income at ultraserfinco for the fourth quarter of  at ecopetrol we expected that the oil company would benefit from the increase in brent prices compared to  fourth quarter in the last quarter the company registered a net profit of   trillion which represented a growth of  compared to the same period of  when it reached   million sales for this period were   billion  above the fourth quarter of  ebitda was   billion with a  margin likewise in the last quarter of the year ecopetrol produced  barrels per day and its total volume sold was  boed german cristancho director of economic research at corredores davivienda indicated that from their analysis center they consider that the main reason for the rebound for the last quarter is price production was practically unchanged so market expectations were positive  corredores daviviendas bet was for the company to deliver fourth quarter revenue of   billion an ebitda of   billion which is equivalent to an ebitda margin of  and in terms of profits the estimate davivienda was at   trillion equivalent to a net margin of  a figure higher than what the market achieved last year dividends for shareholders would be   billion thanks to last years results the company will attribute   billion in dividends to its shareholders which would be a payment per share of   according to camilo thomas analyst at alianza valores these results have to do with the solid cash indicators that ecopetrol had which allowed it to expand it is relevant that the company has reached the same ebitda that it had with oil at us   and us   before the prices were much more favorable but the company is making the same ebitda the structural improvement that the company has had and how it came out of the crisis are important elements  explained thomasthe benefits that shareholders must take into account in ordinary meetings starting tomorrow the second month of the year begins in the calendar of business results reports in addition to one of the largest ecopetrol on march  there will be at least  ordinary meetings in which shareholders will be able to hear the results of the firms  therefore lr asked about the duties and rights of independent investors with these meetings the first point from which people must start is what type of action you have on one side the ordinary title appears as it is on the stock exchange with bancolombia ecopetrol among others these people can participate in decisionmaking or voting this does not happen with preferential papers such as avianca which is listed on the colombian stock exchange bvc with preferencial avianca holdings there the decisionmaking is only for the small group of executives after this it must be remembered that as a benefit the assemblies are the space in which the results of the company are given projects that are presented and in case of specific issues of approval by majority is put to a vote it is the at the moment when the top management approaches its shareholders not everyone has the daytoday possibility of being in charge of their investments so there you can see how the money is going and until the future  explained camilo thomas income analyst variable of alianza valores regarding dates and participation in the meetings the notifications must reach the shareholders and partners of the firm  business days before the meeting this in order to avoid that the decisions taken are ineffective in the case of sas the call will be for five business days unless another calendar of results and information update has been agreed in the statutes shareholders are not required to attend they can even sign a power of attorney to a third party finally it must be remembered that in the case of entities supervised by the financial superintendence in these assembly processes the dividends that will reach the shareholders are determined this money is based on the net income of the fiscal year and not with the adjustments that are usually presented in the business resultspercentage of alcohol in gasoline will be raised from  to  from tomorrow in cities like bogota it is not strange to find clouds of smoke in the morning a product of the waste from the fuels used by cars in other towns such as medellin an environmental emergency has already been declared several times because of this within the framework of the last  convention in paris colombia decided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by  to achieve this one of the elements in which the government has the most hope is the biofuel plan and within that initiative one of the axes is to increase the share of alcohol in the gasoline consumed by cars in order to achieve that this fuel is less polluting since increasing the mixture dilutes the amount of sulfur in the gasoline and increases the oxygen content allowing combustion to be complete and generating less particulate matter which is harmful to health as part of this strategy the ministry of mines in the face of the most recent publication of gasoline prices decided that the ethanol mixture in the gasoline consumed should go from  to  to make it more environmentally friendly environment the increase in the mix however does not have a negative impact on the price for the final consumer since according to market conditions fuel alcohol shows a downward trend which would allow a reduction of close to  pesos per gallon in this regard minminas said that it must be remembered that bioethanol is not the factor that most affects the price of gasoline it is regulated by the ministry of mines and energy and is the result of the sum of several factors where bioethanol it represents  on average of the total sale price of gasoline the tax issue fuel tax surcharge and carbon tax weigh more in the price of fuel which represent  on average of the price paid by the consumer in bogota which is the reference price this variation in the composition of gasoline represents a solution for medellin a city that currently has high levels of pollution with the mixture of ethanol in gasoline by  the contents of aromatics benzene sulfur and sulfur were reduced in the same proportion olefins which are compounds that become air pollutantscolombia will be able to meet the demand for ethanol caused by the change in gasoline since the colombian government participated in the united nations conference on climate change and signed the paris agreement it has advanced various initiatives to meet the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by  by  the most recent is the increase in the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mix which increased from  to  according to the ministry of mines the adjustment which comes into effect today will apply to bogota medellin cali barranquilla cartagena monteria bucaramanga villavicencio pereira manizales ibague and pasto given this increase felipe bayon president of ecopetrol and member of the board of directors of bioenergy one of the strategic projects of the oil company highlighted that ecopetrol is ready to supply more ethanol through bioenergy the largest fuel alcohol plant located in the llanos with a capacity to produce  liters per day  likewise walfredo linhares president of bioenergy pointed out that to achieve this production at the end of  bioenergy had more than  hectares of planted sugar cane jorge bendeck president of the national federation of biofuels of colombia fedebiocombustibles believes that the country will be able to meet the requirements of the blending mandate without importing the use of ethanol in the gasoline mixture reduces greenhouse gas emissions by  and generates less particulate matter since it dilutes the amount of sulfur in gasoline and increases the oxygen content which allows combustion to be carried out complete in addition the presence of ethanol reduces in the same proportion the contents of aromatics benzene and olefins which also pollute the air according to bendeck the use of ethanol not only reduces the emission of gases that cause global warming but also contributes to health fuel ethanol does not emit carbon monoxide or particulate matter which pollute the breathable atmosphere and cause respiratory diseases he mentioned on the other hand the use of ethanol in gasoline improves its energy efficiency since the higher alcohol content increases the octane number of gasoline which reduces the need to use extra gasoline in cities with a latitude close to sea level  this improves the operation of the engines and saves fuel the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol ecopetrol is ready to supply more ethanol through bioenergy with a capacity to produce  liters per day julio cesar vera president of acipet the country could increase its mix to  or  without difficulty the valle plants and the bioenergy plants could meet that demand without generating financing problems as for whether vehicle engines in colombia would resist this new mixture julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet highlights that there is much of the vehicle fleet especially the new one which even has the possibility of using up to  ethanol when fuel alcohol entered the country a series of evaluations were made that showed that can use  on average in the mix without affecting the vehicles in fact the vast majority of brands would resist up to   said the president of the association who even called for the government increases the proportion to  it is worth mentioning that in the past the gasoline mixture was used with  ethanol but its percentage decreased due to a shortage of supply however vera considers that with the e ntrated from bionergy there will be enough ethanol to increase the percentageecopetrol isa and bancolombia have had the best returns in the last  months the euronoesis financial services efs report which can be found on the page of the colombian stock exchange shows that the shares of ecopetrol isa and bancolombia are the ones that have had the best returns in the last year with profitability of   and  respectively this means that those who bet with   million for the species of the state oil company when its price was at   benefited with a profit of   million  months later related article in  ecopetrol achieved profits of   billion and grew  compared to  regarding this title the bancolombia research team pointed out that in line with what was observed during  the company continues to show strong operating results favored by the efficiencies achieved a favorable price scenario and the entry into operation and stabilization of reficar this is reflected in a significant growth in the ebitda margin and net profit  now for those looking to buy shares and get into the good moment of the company the efs analysis also shows that in the medium term an upward trend in the price is seen however it clarifies that it has a risk of  in the medium term a figure that is above  of the titles in the top  according to marcela ramirez analyst at equity de valores y valores this risk occurs because being a stateowned company and being close to elections some indicators could be affected for example the main concern is reserves since the company pointed out that fracking is needed to increase them in this way the risk occurs because there are candidates that are sounding strongly that do not support this extraction method  before continuing with the analysis it is worth clarifying that despite the fact that the title of carvajal empaques is that the one that occupies the first place with a return of  the share is not comparable since the rise was due to a specific repurchase operation analysis of profitability and risk related article the market expects the companies ecopetrol and exito to lead in growth of results thus in second place is the title of isa according to diego franco cofounder of the franco group this rise was due to better international businesses that are bearing fruit especially due to higher revenues from energy transportation and concessions in brazil on the prospect the title has an upward trend for the very short term due to new business that could win in the energy auctions however in the long term the trend is neutral since analysts are waiting for a regulation from the creg that could have an impact on appreciation for this reason we have a target price of   by the end of the year added ramirez finally compared to bancolombia which had a profitability of  in one year analysts pointed out that it was the result of a very strong third quarter the financial sector was constrained because the issuer kept lowering rates and limiting net interest income however at that point the bank showed that with portfolio management it managed to maintain profits and lower delinquencies for  no major change is expected  concluded ramirez on avianca which had a profitability of  the trend is bullish with the possibility of reaching  grupo exito and ecopetrol lead an increase in earnings in terms of dividends to their shareholders related article the benefits that shareholders should take into account in ordinary meetings the modest growth of  of the colombian economy in  was not an impediment to slow down the business development of the country although some sectors suffered more than others companies in the commerce energy and industry sectors managed to overcome the obstacles so much so that in the ranking by growth in annual sales grupo exito ecopetrol and bvc led with increases of   and  respectively although there are still a large number of companies to report their financial statements today the list has  firms in this group while revenues total just over   trillion profits amount to   trillion grupo exito topped the list of companies with the highest growth in profits the company led by carlos mario giraldo achieved a positive variation of  in its profits as it went from   million in  to   million last year in the midst of a complex situation we have employed solid strategies on different fronts that position us as leaders in the retail sector we can say that we took it out of the stadium because the net profit multiplied five times  giraldo clarified days ago in an interview with lr with these good results and revenues of   billion in  exito announced that it would invest   million in colombia to strengthen its position in the different formats the good news from the retail sector was also joined by the colombian oil company ecopetrol because although its income rose  to   billion its net profits attributable to shareholders grew  to total   billion last year for felipe bayon president of the company  was a year of great operational and financial achievements for ecopetrol net profit amounted to   trillion the highest in the last four years and  higher than the  profit even with a  lower brent price  the king trio was completed by the colombian stock exchange bvc the company achieved a  net profit which allowed it to reach   million in profits this figure allowed it to place itself on the podium of the companies with the highest sales above avianca and celsia one of the big surprises in the group with the highest increase in profit was avianca the airline despite closing a difficult year due to the  days of cessation of activities of acdac pilots reported   million in profits which allowed a growth of  in this area of analysis it is important to note that according to the company the expectation was to reach a profit of   million which would have been the best year for the holding company given this balance last week roberto held chief financial officer of avianca holdings clarified that although these results show a solid avianca this should not influence the realization of the alliance with united since these types of agreements are not based on financial results  the top  of this list is completed by celsia the energy company of grupo argos according to its most recent financial report its profits grew  going from   million in  to   million last year however its revenues fell  to total   billion in this area with these good results in earnings celsia clarified that they will invest this year close to   billion in two main fronts   million for the acquisition of an additional  of epsa and   million for the modernization of the business technological bets growth in solar farms the grupo argos subsidiary was also joined by another firm from the same sector it is the enel group with its companies emgesa and codensa this because while the first achieved a  growth in its earnings reaching   million the second totaled   which allowed it to achieve an increase in profits of  emgesa presented a solid performance in  boosting its net profit levels due to the highly efficient commercial and financial management of the company as well as the good availability of water that resulted in a higher hydroelectric yield clarified lucio rubio ceo of enel colombia the construction sector did not have much prominence since conconcreto the developer of roads tunnels and buildings reached   million in net income which left a negative variable of  in that year it is valid to clarify that in light of this balance juan luis aristizabal president of constructora conconcreto confirmed at a press conference that the board of directors is making a recommendation not to pay dividends in  for the results of the previous year it is a strategically oriented decision to preserve all the liquid resources of the company to fulfill the projects that are in progress  the other companies that make up the  firms on the list did not present returns at the end of last year this is the case of grupo sura which presented a negative variable of   epsa grupo argos of  and cemex latam holdings with a fall of  this week the financial results of two subsidiaries of grupo energia bogota geb terpel and promigas are expected to be delivered the firms that led sales in  although grupo exito and ecopetrol led sales and profits at the end of last year grupo sura ranked third among the firms with the highest revenues totaling   billion after this line the argos group positioned itself which declared   billion in revenues driven by celsia and its concessions and infrastructure company odinsa the top five of these companies with the highest sales were completed by avianca holdings with   billioncolombian preferred shares would be affected by changes in the msci indices according to a report by davivienda corredores the msci is evaluating the possibility of including a factor that measures the voting rights of issuers in the asset selection and weighting methodology the local analysis group indicated that this change in the indices would have a negative impact particularly in the common and preferred shares of bancolombia grupo avals preferential the ordinary one of cementos argos and grupo argos and the ordinary and preferential one of grupo sura the proposal indicates that this would be an additional adjustment value both for the current and new indices but that the change will have a transition period of three years so it would enter  if the schedule is met the decision to approve the change would be announced in june of this year despite the impacts of the nine stocks that are actively moving there would be no eliminations of local securities in the mcsi emerging markets but there would be a decrease in the participation of colombia on the market cap which would go from  to     the report adds that bancolombia would be the one that would feel the greatest change in its valuation it would represent  of the fall in colombias market cap followed by grupo aval  grupo sura  grupo argos   and finally the ordinary share of cementos argos  on the contrary the analysis establishes that the securities of isa and ecopetrol which have  and  of the participation would not be affected this is because the capital stock of these companies is  ordinary securitiessales at the cartagena refinery grew  in  compared to  the cartagena refinery reported that its sales grew  in  and reached

interest taxes and depreciation showed a significant improvement in  since it was   million while in  it was    million according to the refinery expectations were exceeded thanks to the implementation of a plan that included optimization and cost reduction reficar also noted that the plant had an excellent operating performance in the second half of the year in  we exceeded expectations thanks to the efforts of the entire company for  we have greater challenges such as an ebitda of more than   million and reaching refining margins around us   per barrel amaury de la espriella president of reficar highlighted about the results in the report the refinery also reported a net profit of   million in  which as a result of the remarkable operating performance during the second half of last year they attribute to the refinery optimization plans and a positive assessment of the company under international financial reporting standards additionally reficar increased production as a result of the stabilization phase and efforts in operational optimization on average the refinerys load was  barrels of crude per day in  when in the previous year the average was  barrels of crude per day according to ecopetrol spokespersons the refinerys capacity is  barrels per day but it is currently operating slightly above at  barrels per day on average the plant also highlighted that last year the global performance test of the  units was carried out which consisted of operating  continuous days and in a synchronized manner with an average load of  barrels per day with which one of the commitments was fulfilled with international banking the contrasts amaury de la espriella president of reficar for  we have major challenges such as an ebitda of more than   million and refining margins close to us   per barrel on the other hand ecopetrol president felipe bayon told reuters that the oil companys target range for this year is between  barrels which was the  production and  barrels equivalent per day in addition the company intends to continue its growth through the purchase of assets and participating in auctions in latin america and the united states this after completing a budget cut of us   billionthe ecopetrol title has gained  so far this year so far this year ecopetrols stock has moved in accordance with the international oil prices which for some experts means a recovery period since in the three months of  it has always been above   which was the value that started this year in this way between january and march the title has gained  from   to the   with which it closed the week yesterday however at times the species traded at levels of   thanks to the threeyear historical levels at which brent traded at the end of january the surprise has been appearing in the last week as its action has accumulated  setbacks despite the good financial results published by the state oil company seven days ago according to the information released by ecopetrol  closed it with a net profit of   trillion the highest profit in the last four years in addition according to the statement from the oil company net profit was  higher than that registered in  with a  lower brent likewise average production amounted to  boed reaching the companys goal despite the attacks against cano limon and the blockade that stopped crude oil production at la cira infantas for  days as for last years proven reserves these amount to  million barrels equivalent ecopetrol also announced that the average life increased to  years and that the reserve replacement rate was  for daniel lombana an analyst at global securities the year of the oil company has been quite good what has been happening is that the market already had the good financial results of the company for granted so these were not going to have a significant impact within of the trading price and continues to move with the fluctuation of crude which has fallen from us   to us   per barrel in recent weeksthe companies that investors want to see in the colombian stock exchange due to the complicated moment that colcap is going through which has lost approximately  in value so far this year some brokerage firms believe that if several of the most important companies in the country joined the basket in in the medium term this could give a boost to the most important index of the colombian stock exchange in such a way that for example several firms indicated that they would like to go public as issuers of shares of companies such as alpina empresas publicas de medellin epm colombina rappi bavaria and postobon to name a few although if you look sector by sector there are many more that would be needed thus companies such as viva colombia juan valdez servbinetega anglo gold colombia gold alqueria or supertiendas olimpica could also go to the stock market basket this would be a very important factor to expand the colombian stock market to make it much deeper and more attractive to investors the experts clarified among the advantages that this incursion represents for companies is that by having a broader base of investors external agents do a very good oversight of corporate governance which ends up improving processes and control explained camilo silva founding partner de valora inversiones who added that this would be an option for new startups that are looking for investment money to finish growing as facebook or snapchat did at the time in the same way much more transparent systems are created since all companies that are listed on the colombian stock exchange have to make all their reports public and there is strong regulation in addition in the stock market explained juan david ballen  director of investigations of casa de bolsa companies could also access the financial market more easily where they can find resources to finance investments works and all their expansion plans the expert said for camilo thomas an analyst at alianza valores the appetite for the stock market would increase since for individuals it is very attractive to invest in large companies which look safe however thomas stressed this will not have any impact in the short term on the colcap index although it is expected that in the medium and long term a much more robust index will be obtained with larger companies and with a capitalization highest we would very much like to see the largest and most emblematic companies in colombia on the stock exchange that contribute to the country and are already in the memory of consumers said the alianza valores analyst faced with all this panorama the question is why these companies are not listed on the stock market the analysts response is that some companies are not interested in losing control of their participation while others prefer to find resources through the issuance of local or foreign bonds with which they do not lose control of the shares the contrasts camilo thomas analyst at alianza valores we would very much like to see the largest and most emblematic companies in colombia on the stock exchange that contribute to the country and are already in our memory daniel escobar director of strategy at global securities there are several reasons why companies do not go public among which are the disclosure or regulation another explanation according to daniel escobar director of the strategy department of global securities has to do with the regulatory issue because when entering the stock market regulatory entities demand to comply with a series of regulations that not all companies are interested in to comply therefore it depends on each of the companies how they want to finance themselves since each of the financial instruments carries a series of benefits and disadvantages for the firms it all depends on the companys strategy said german cristancho head of investigations at corredores davivienda shares delisted from the bvc in recent years several companies have left the stock market at this time valorem through a takeover bid announced that it would withdraw its shares from the stock market due in part to its low trading on the market in addition to the odinsa announcement with isagen tablemac pacific ep petrominerales and helm there are already seven organizations that have decided to step aside and delist their shares from the local stock market in the last five years it is worth mentioning that each case has been different and not all companies have done it for valorems reasons for example the situations of helm isagen odinsa and petrominerales are related to the fact that the companies were sold helm to corpbanca isagen to brookfield odinsa to grupo argos and petrominerales to pacific similarly at the beginning of  tablemac which is dedicated to the manufacture of furniture and of which the brazilian multinational duratex owns  decided to delist its share without specific reasons cemex was the one that rose the most in the stock market on the first day of the week on the colombian stock market the share that rose the most was that of cemex latam holding since it had an advance of  and reached priced at   on the contrary the mineros title was the one that fell the most on the day as it lost  and ended the session at   regarding the most traded the ecopetrol title was the most important moving more than   million lastly the colcap index rose  and reached  unitsecopetrols production in magdalena medio exceeded  barrels per day ecopetrol reported that in december  the  fields operated by the oil company in magdalena medio recorded a production of  barrels of oil equivalent per day of these la cira infantas stood out reaching a record  barrels per day according to the company among the activities that drove production are the improved water injection pilots in the cira infantas management the polymer injection pilot carried out in the rio management and compliance with  of production in the de mares management  in addition in this area there was a reserve replacement index of  which means that for every barrel produced last year  barrels were replaced likewise the optimization of costs achieved in production fields such as provincia llanito yarigui and tibu among others leveraged the achievements for  the production goal for the central region is  barrels of oil equivalent they also expect to develop  drilling works for producing wells and injectors in the de mares del rio la cira infanta and catatumbo areascolombia joins a wave of oil auctions in latin america with bids in april colombia plans to award up to  oil blocks next month and will begin routinely offering onshore and offshore areas for exploration and production in may the head of the countrys energy regulator told reuters the first offer of new areas in colombia in four years coincides with initiatives by most of its neighbors to attract new investments in energy argentina brazil ecuador mexico and uruguay will also hold tenders this year following a rise in crude prices and an increase in exploration resources the next awards in colombia will be held in the sinusan jacinto basin in the northwest of the country said orlando velandia president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh in an interview within the framework of the ceraweek energy conference colombia needs foreign investment to reactivate its stagnant oil and gas production the andean country plans to increase production only slightly to  barrels of oil equivalent per day this year velandia said colombias last oil auction in  secured investments from firms such as conocophillips and parex resources for seven unconventional projects which are nearing the completion of the exploration stage to later begin early production of shale oil and gas we want to grant as many blocks as possible in this process  this pause has been useful to reflect and gain experience in a lowprice environment velandia said parex resources and gran tierra from canada nexen petroleum a unit of the chinese cnooc the colombian hocol talisman energy of repsol and the american noble energy qualified for the sinusan jacinto auction offers will be presented in the next few days and results are expected in early april velandia said after completing the auction colombia hopes to start offering blocks permanently in a process similar to the one brazil plans this year colombias offer will include about two dozen areas onshore and offshore that can receive offers at any time the new mechanism was approved last year and will be tested in may colombias priority is to develop the resources offshore velandia saidecopetrol will institute legal action against a fine imposed by the ministry of labor faced with a fine that the ministry of labor imposed on ecopetrol the oil company announced that it will institute the corresponding legal actions against the decision the fine which was announced by the oil company was imposed by the directorate of inspection surveillance control and territorial management of the ministry of labor and has a value of one hundred legal monthly minimum wages in force that is it amounts to   millions according to what was communicated by ecopetrol the sanction is the result of the ministry considering that the effects of agreement  of  violate the rights of union association in recent days the ecopetrol union the uso held protests over wage claims which caused disturbances in the operation of the cartagena and barrancabermeja refineries the oil company rejected the attacks against some workers of the contractor companies at the service of the barrancabermeja refineryecopetrol confirmed the presence of oil in the  well located in meta ecopetrol announced that it confirmed the presence of crude oil in the  well located in the montecristo village of the guamal municipality in the meta department the discovery was made at a depth of  meters and it was recorded that the oil is heavy  degrees api in tertiaryage sands that add up to a thickness of  meters the presence of crude in  confirms the potential for heavy hydrocarbons that exists in this area of the eastern plains where we produce about half of the countrys oil and opens a great opportunity for growth the generation of employment investment and development of the municipality of guamal and meta it is satisfactory to add one more finding within the ambitious exploration campaign we are carrying out in the colombian territory to increase the reserves of ecopetrol and the country  said felipe bayon president of ecopetrol  is operated by ecopetrol which has a  stake and talisman colombia oil  gas a repsol company that has a  stake in the exploration and production contract for block  this block currently produces more than  barrels of oil per day after the discovery at the akacias wellthe anh expects production of some  barrels a day within the framework of the ceraweek energy conference in houston the president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh oscar velandia announced that this years goal of the entity is to increase national production to  barrels of oil equivalent per day the figure exceeds the governments official goal which in the medium term fiscal framework is set at  barrels per day the agencys expectation is also higher than that of the ministry of mines and energy whose portfolio chief german arce estimates that daily production would be  barrels according to pedro carmona director of the institute of hydrocarbons mines and energy of the sergio arboleda university the production of barrels per day could increase due to new wells currently production is around  barrels of oil per day this could increase if new discoveries are made and new wells come into operation he said the academic pointed out that the recovery factor could also influence a higher production this term is understood as the amount or percentage of crude that is in a reservoir and that from a technical point of view can be recovered it is important to mention that technically not all crude is recoverable so there are different types of recovery in order to increase this extraction more technology must be applied on the other hand julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet considers that production will be above  barrels per day if the situation is normal if problems of public order and protests do not continue to arise production will surely be exceeded he said in addition the leader added that the projects that could really increase production are those of improved recovery and development drilling another aspect that would influence the increase in the number of barrels per day is international prices if these vary downward it is likely that production will not increase but may even decrease the investment environment for this year should also be taken into account according to the perspectives of the colombian petroleum association acp this year the investment estimates for exploration and production will increase for the second consecutive year between  and  more than in  in that same report the acp highlights that in colombia there are opportunities to invest however he points out that entrepreneurs see environmental risks and legal uncertainties that make operations difficult and slow down investments especially in exploration the contrasts pedro carmona director of the hydrocarbons institute of the sergio arboleda university one of the situations that can influence an increase in production is the recovery factor since they are quantities that can be recovered it should be added that the investment environment for the second half and forward will depend on the next president some signals that candidates such as those from the center left have given could affect sector investment if they continue against the industry or some of its activities  concluded vera new discovery of heavy crude in meta the ecopetrol company announced that the presence of oil in the  well located in the department of meta was confirmed the find was recorded at a depth of  meters in tertiaryage

and bancolombia the shares that have grown the most in the bvc in  so far in  there are several shares listed on the colombian stock exchange bvc that have performed well however the winner is the ecopetrol species which has appreciated  so far this year as it went from   on january  to   at the close of friday analysts point to several factors to explain the reasons why the price of the oil company has performed well this year the first has to do with the recovery of international prices of brent benchmark oil in the international market during much of the first quarter although it has had its peaks and falls crude oil was once again above us   and even surpassed the ceiling of us   which helped improve both the companys results and its performance action in several days german cristancho head of economic research at corredores davivienda indicated that the increase in the price of brent during the last quarter was the main variable to boost ecopetrols income similarly the analyzes have highlighted the reduction of the companys debt and the optimization of various internal processes another of the shares that has shown a good movement over the last three months is that of bancolombia which in this period has presented a positive variation of  since at this moment it is quoted at   almost   per above the value at the beginning of the year despite the whole issue of the avianca pilots strike german efromovichs company has advanced  in the bvc and is already worth   in the same sense of the species that are part of the colcap index only three more have had good results during the quarter thus bancolombias preferential has gained  while the papers of grupo exito and empresa de energia de bogota eeb grew  and  respectively on the contrary there are several companies that have not had a good year on the stock market the one that has been most affected is corficolombiana which has lost  a fact that could be related to the problem with the collapse of the chirajara bridge on the bogotavillaviencio road according to experts in addition both the common and preferred shares of cementos argos have fallen so far in  the first by  and the second by  this depreciation is mainly explained by the exit of the species from the ftse russell index which drove the sale of this paper other shares that have fallen are clh  argos  etb  and isa  colcap index lost  in yesterdays session on mondays session on the colombian stock exchange the share that rose the most was the spanish entity bbva colombia which had a positive appreciation of  and ended the session at   on the other hand the species that lost the most on the day was that of grupo aval as it fell  and ended the session at   per unit as is usual in the market the most traded share was ecopetrol  which moved   million throughout the day for its part the colcap index lost  and closed at  unitsecopetrol will file legal actions for a fine from the ministry of labor the last few weeks have not been entirely good for ecopetrol in relation to its unions the latest episode of controversy is still ongoing after the oil company announced that it will institute legal actions against the decision of the directorate of inspection surveillance control and territorial management of the ministry of labor to fine it  minimum legal monthly wages in force is say   million considering that the effects of agreement  of  violate the rights of union association it should be remembered that in the last two weeks there have been several protests by the unions in the barrancabermeja and cartagena refineries and these demonstrations led at the end of last month to the blocking of the first of the oil processing plants and to the rejection of ecopetrol of the de facto routes of its workers according to the workers union the protests at the refineries were due to an alleged breach of the conditions of outsourced workers especially in relation to working conditions and the payment of wages overtime and sunday of some of them to which the oil company replied that it had been acting in accordance with what was agreed at that time the union sindical obrera uso estimated that  workers would be affected and a few days later when they tried to resume work at the refinery they denounced that ecopetrol had canceled the contracts of  workers from allied companiesecopetrol will pay an international bond of us   million issued in  related article ecopetrol confirmed the presence of oil in the  well located in meta ecopetrol announced that on april  it will pay in advance the us   million of the fiveyear international bond which was issued in  the oil company informed through a statement published by the financial superintendency that the bond that will be subject to prepayment is the first maturity of ecopetrols international bonds which according to the initial conditions of the prospectus was scheduled for september    regarding this payment the company explained that this is the result of the solid cash position that has been consolidating since  as it amounted to more than   billion at the end of last year as a result of the prepayment operation the credit metrics continue to improve the gross debt  ebitda indicator reported as of december   would go from  times to  times additionally the groups cash position is expected to continue at high levels levels of solidity which will allow it to face volatility scenarios in crude prices and maintain the pace of investment for organic growth opportunities the company clarified in its press release this early cancellation is framed in the roadmap of the companys  business plan this because ecopetrol is committed to continue improving its credit rating and increasing the return for its shareholdersecopetrol has government approval to create an electric power subsidiary through decree  of march  of this year the government authorized ecopetrol to participate in the constitution of an energy subsidiary the next step is to establish the company before the chamber of commerce ecopetrol is approximately  of the national energy demand the decree enables it through its subsidiary to manage its consumption and selfgenerate energy more efficiently said german arce minister of mines and energy the creation of this new company whose name is sociedad ecopetrol energia was approved by the board of directors of ecopetrol last october with a direct and indirect participation of the oil company of  according to spokespersons for the business group this new subsidiary is part of the general longterm energy strategy which seeks to ensure the permanent availability of energy at competitive prices and generate income for the company this new subsidiary assumes the energy purchase process that the ecopetrol group requires for its operations and the sale of selfgeneration surpluses without intermediaries thus you buy cheaper energy and capture the marketing margin directly its objective is not in mass distribution to end users said an ecopetrol spokesperson according to the company the oil company consumes about  megawatts for all its operations this is almost the same as what the department of atlantico consumes of the total consumption  megawatts  are selfgenerated in the same operations and the rest  is acquired in the national interconnected system through purchase contracts with various generators likewise the company announced that its installed capacity to produce energy is  megawatts other companies in the manufacturing and miningenergy sector have their own trading companies that allow them to obtain savings between  and  of the cost of the energy they require to operate which increases their competitiveness said the spokesperson at the moment it is known that the authorized capital for investment in the ecopetrol energia company is   million pesos and it is expected to enter into operation in the second half of the year the contrasts jorge ivan gonzalez economist i think its very good that ecopetrol diversifies and ventures into other sectors hopefully progress in the search for alternative energy  german arce minister of mines and energy ecopetrol is approximately  of the national energy demand the decree enables it to manage its consumption and selfgenerate energy more efficiently  likewise an ecopetrol spokesperson mentioned that the manager of the subsidiary will be luis eduardo leiva mutis an electromechanical engineer who has served as head of ecopetrols commercial department and as emgesas energy marketing assistant manager however as the company is in the process of being incorporated leiva is not yet in business it is worth mentioning that with the new energy strategy and transformation program ecopetrol achieved savings of   million the goal is that by  savings will be close to   million with actions to optimize selfgeneration energy efficiency and increase in electrical reliabilityget to know companies that lead the rankings and where every young person would like to work the evolution in technology has allowed the creation of new companies in sectors that were previously completely unknown for this reason young people no longer aim to work in large banks but in companies like google or facebook this conclusion was drawn by the study carried out by the glassdoor company which has been making a list for  years to see where young people want to perform the social network facebook occupies the first place despite its latest controversies and the stagnation in user growth due to its privacy policies and competencies of other platforms the company has around  employees around the world and has an office in colombia this is the reason why it is preferred by young people due to its permanent innovation and work philosophy it also has facilities that allow the workers creativity to be enhanced and apparently that is all that mark zuckerberg ceo and founder of the company google is also a company where young people want to work the search engine is known for always acquiring the best programmers and creatives in the united states however many are the foreigners who are

provides good services to its workers is linkedin the portal in charge of uniting professionals according to research the benefits workers acquire are comprehensive from dental health to free snacks on the other hand the status of a company always attracts the attention of young people this is why many would like to work in the companies that lead the global   a list of the most valuable companies in the world this year amazon topped the list above apple or google in europe the most valuable company is mercedes benz and in asia it was samsung in colombia the stateowned ecopetrol is the most valuable brand although it fell  positions compared to last year in the region companies such as pemex itau claro brasil are the best valuedthe new ecopetrol subsidiary is not seen as a threat by the energy unions with the approval of the national government ecopetrol will not only participate in the constitution of a subsidiary but a new actor will enter the energy market the entry of new agents invigorates the energy market promoting competition and the formation of efficient prices the participation of these new agents favors market development and they are welcome maintaining the standards required for their efficient integration into the system said cecilia maya xms energy market manager although ecopetrol energia sasesp must continue the constitution process in the chamber of commerce and then register as a marketer with its nit before the xm regulator some unions in the energy sector are already wondering what its impact will be once it enters the market for alejandro castaneda president of the national association of generating companies andeg the ecopetrol subsidiary would be one more player in the market we dont see it as a threat within the limits of the sector and according to the market rules it is one more selfgenerator like others that have been created by other companies to supply its consumption  he mentioned likewise the president of the colombian natural gas association naturgas orlando cabrales said that the sale of surpluses would have a positive impact on the market because it would increase the supply a greater supply is always good for the market and in this case more so when critical hydrology situations arise since ecopetrols generation is with natural gas which pollutes less than the thermal ones he said it is worth remembering that the ecopetrol subsidiary is expected to start operations in the second half of this year and would assume the process of buying and selling energy that the ecopetrol group requires to carry out its operations the contrasts orlando cabrales segovia chairman of naturgas what ecopetrol is doing is organizing the management of energy purchases it is a correct decision to be efficient  according to spokesmen for the oil company this new company seeks to buy cheaper energy and capture the marketing margin directly in addition its objective is not mass distribution to end users but to selfsupply the company however they would sell surplus generation to the national system the creation of the subsidiary is part of the new energy strategy of the oil company and was approved by its board of directors in october   million will be investedecopetrol shares grew  and closed the day at   per unit on the bvc ecopetrols share was one of the bestperforming shares yesterday on the

national police in the last hours dismantled two criminal organizations that committed crimes in the departments of antioquia meta and santander where they were dedicated to the theft of oil infrastructure such as pipes copper bronze valves enclosures and circuit panels owned by the company ecopetrol according to the authorities the first operation was carried out in the departments of antioquia and santander after an investigation that was carried out since  and that exposed the way of committing los tobias the gang was dedicated to stealing elements in wells and fields located in the municipalities of yondo antioquia and barrancabermeja santander essential materials for the processing of hydrocarbons the first investigations were able to determine that the members of this organization were responsible for more than  thefts committed between the years  and  in oil fields located in the magdalena medio region events that caused the frequent cessation of exploration and exploitation of crude oil which caused significant economic losses to the colombian state the police report confirmed that among those captured is a man known as carcamo the main leader of said criminal organization and who is accused of being responsible for the planning of several of the thefts acts that would have cost him the oil company more than five billion pesos in the middle of the operations they also seized  cell phones a roll of rubberized cable four kilos of cable protection sleeve three kilos of aluminum cable  kilos of lead and a smith  wesson revolver the  people arrested are requested for the crime of qualified and aggravated theft simultaneously in the municipality of puerto gaitan meta the  members of the criminal structure los pelacables were captured who according to the authorities managed to steal more than one ton of copper from different operating points of oil companies that carry out work in this region the police report confirmed that among those captured is the leader of the structure a man known as dario who together with the other members planned the robberies in the rural area of this population this person is accused of committing more than  thefts of this material which was sold in junkyards in nearby municipalities such as puerto gaitan puerto lopez and villavicencio according to the investigation los pelacables have been committing crimes since  during this period they committed continuous thefts of copper cables in the oil clusters located in the rubiales field a situation that affected the infrastructure and forced on repeated occasions to cease of crude oil exploration and exploitation operations generating millions in losses to ecopetrol those captured must answer for the crimes of conspiracy to commit a crime qualified and aggravated theft damage to works or elements of the communications energy and fuel services and receptionprices and findings mark the new reality of oil in colombia the countrys oil industry is going through its best moment after the crisis that occurred between  and  the current price of crude oil over us   a barrel investments in exploration and production activities and the new findings of major operators since the end of last year they have revealed a new outlook for the sector in  the minister of mines and energy german arce explained that after the fall in international oil prices which led to a sharp contraction in exploration and production  the industry has managed to adapt to the new scenario attracting foreign investment and encouraging oil activity proof of this is the   billion in profit of ecopetrol in  the head of the energy portfolio was optimistic about this scenario and highlighted that in addition to the industrys ability to adapt the price levels in the first months of the year and the measures that have been promoted by the national government they suggest that  will be a good year in terms of incorporating reserves production and findings until april  the officially proven oil reserves were  million barrels of crude according to the ministry of mines and energy which at the current rate of production over  barrels per day would give about  years of relationship reserves  production however the figures presented by ecopetrol in its balance sheet for  show a recovery according to the stateowned company as of december   the ecopetrol groups proven reserves amount to  million barrels of oil equivalent with which the average life increased from  to  years with a reserve replacement rate that reached  the highest in the last three years this means that for every barrel produced  barrels were added to the reserves this result was largely leveraged by the success of the recovery factor increase program and the constant development of ecopetrols fields the entity said when consulted by colprensa it should be remembered that  of the countrys proven reserves are owned by ecopetrol while hocol ecopetrol america and the stakes in equion and savia peru contribute the remaining  as explained by the companys president felipe bayon minister german arce was emphatic in stating that with the improved recovery projects being implemented in the country and the pending development findings it is expected that in two years the reserves will continue their upward trend reaching a reserve  production of eight years or more the president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh orlando velandia is also optimistic at the end of march we will make the final evaluation of our level of reserves we will surely increase our selfsufficiency horizon thanks to the optimization of resources due to the improvement in prices and the incorporation of new discovered barrels he said and the production minister arce said that the sector also shows clear signs of an increase in activity which is why the decline in production of the last two years is expected to slow down to have significant production increases from next year and from there continue to increase in the medium term for this the new findings reported in recent days are important to maintain the goal that the country set for itself with production levels above  barrels of crude oil per day it should be remembered that the  mediumterm fiscal framework established a production goal for  of  barrels per day and a price of us   per barrel the january figures show that oil production was  barrels per day which although it represented a decrease of  compared to the same month of  and a drop of  compared to december of last year keep above the goal set by the national government for january the impact was due to electrical failures in fields and attacks on infrastructure arce explained that the discovery that will potentially add the largest reserves to the country is that of the  well in the  block given the size of the heavy and extraheavy crude deposits in the llanos basin which have a potential greater than  million

for growth job creation investment and investment development of the municipality of guamal and meta  said the president of ecopetrol the company also announced discoveries in the infantas oriente rex ne  and harvest  wells which are undergoing tests to evaluate their potential determine the amount of resources they possess and eventually may enter in commercial production stage for the first with a depth between  and  meters more than  barrels per day are projected in the department of arauca the wells cosecha  and rex ne  specifically in the municipality of arauquita were recorded at depths of  and  meters respectively the latter would have a daily production potential of  barrels per day according to the national hydrocarbons agency the president of the anh highlighted that these discoveries are important but we continue in the search for a great discovery that will help us improve our reserve horizon of the  wells drilled in the previous year almost a third of these have reported discoveries thats a good success rate but the reserve potential of each is being evaluated  precisely the anh began at the end of last year the competitive process sinusan jacinto which closes offers in april of this year after this we hope to regulate and start with permanent competitive processes which will give greater dynamics to the allocation of areas said german arce velandia meanwhile explained that these  blocks are currently being offered in this area of the country and we hope that once the drilling work is undertaken by the winning companies we will have information on their real potential that is a very prospective area  investments the president of the colombian petroleum association acp francisco lloreda explained that the companies estimate that this year between us   billion and us   billion will be invested in exploration and production with which it is expected to drill  to  exploratory wells and execute  kilometers of seismic on land the investment environment survey shows moderate optimism marked by higher expectations from the geological point of view better security conditions and a good supply of goods and services said lloreda there ecopetrol will play a determining role the president of the company pointed out that in  there are important challenges such as increasing our production in a range between  and  barrels of oil per day for which investments between  and  million dollars are contemplated with a marked focus on exploration and production  bayon explained that in exploration and production the drilling of more than  development wells at least  exploratory wells the use of  drilling rigs and the acquisition of more than  kilometers of  and  seismic stand out likewise it is expected to develop activities in about  pilot projects for the implementation of improved recovery technologies  in the refining segment the companys efforts are focused on optimizing the operation of the new cartagena refinery where they expect an ebitda of at least  million pesos and a doubledigit refining margin the company will achieve a milestone in refined products with its two refineries processing between  and  barrels per day bayon said for this year ecopetrols budget was made with a barrel of oil below us   and the equilibrium price is us   that is at that price we can make investments pay dividends expenses payroll and so on in  it was required to be more than us   he saidthere are  colombian companies among the  multilatinas colombia is the country that has added the most multilatinas in the report prepared by the boston consulting group bcg with a growth of  compared to the report issued in  the consulting firm analyzes more than  companies with revenues of more than us   millions and with operations beyond its borders the colombian representatives are avianca bancolombia ecopetrol grupo energia bogota empresas publicas de medellin grupo argos grupo aval grupo bolivar grupo nutresa interconectado electrica isa and sura in the  analysis colombia only had nine companies on the list so with the increase of  it is the country whose participation was the one that grew the most in the entire region bcg mentions that this growth can be largely attributable to the strength and regional breadth of the colombian financial sector services in this segment represent  of multilatinas in colombia compared to  in brazil and  in mexico the consulting firm notes that the country has a solid reputation for reliability in the regions business community and high confidence in its financial system according to the world economic forum colombian institutions such as bancolombia and banco de bogota grupo aval have been particularly successful in expanding into central america luis fernando martin director of the phd of aden business school also highlights the behavior in central america but also points out that this favorable growth is also due to the expansion in the retail sector in the southern part of the continent and advises organizations to expand towards this territory since there is a lot of growth opportunity and an opportunity to serve a market in a better and more comprehensive way related article latin companies that reign on the us stock market related article the norwegian investment fund invested last year in  colombian companies approximately half of the multilatin companies listed in  did not make it to the  list bcg points out that most fell because they failed to maintain strong enough growth or profitability in the colombian case avianca and grupo argos are the only two companies that remain martin mentions aviancas progress in the argentine market pointing out that they have a great growth opportunity as it is a market that is neglected the university professor who is an expert in finance francisco cubillos highlights that in colombia the phenomenon of multilatinas banking occurs because there is a trend of key strengthening of the financial sector internally even if they are not from a production sector and that companies that want to continue the example of avianca and grupo argos they must follow a process of internal strengthening and then impact in latin america the contrasts luis fernando martin director phd aden business school companies must continue looking for mergers but above all local purchases and acquisitions in the spaces they reach francisco cubillos university professor expert in finance financial concentration in colombia is in very few groups so banking companies can be dominant the

closed the oil company launched an investigation has requested technical assistance and is importing equipment to kill said well from the bottom to permanently seal the well ecopetrol will reduce the pressure in the well stop the flow from its head and kill it at more than  feet by drilling a relief well that intercepts the original well work is being done to contain the disaster and affected

in a context of better prospects for oil prices in this sense carlos benavides executive vice president of mansarovar energy highlighted that during  an exploration investment level of close to us   million is planned regarding investment in production it is expected to have a growth of more than  equivalent to us   billion likewise it is expected that at the level of exploratory wells activity will increase and new wells will be drilled which will certainly bring benefits for the growth and profitability of the industry  on the other hand lloreda pointed out that this year a growth in production could be seen to reach a range between  and  barrels per day if the conditions regarding prices are met for his part julio cesar vera diaz president of acipet pointed out that taking as a reference the best international crude prices that we have this year with levels above us   per barrel with the brent reference the growth that the hydrocarbon industry expects hand in hand with

 and  million barrels the exploitation of unconventional fields has become a real possibility for colombia to substantially change its history and its status as a nonoil country despite having the resource its crude production is limited and the specter of shortages appears from time to time with the exploitation of unconventional fields the change would be drastic reserves could be tripled and go from five years of oil selfsufficiency to  years the increase in reserves would also lead to significant investment in oil projects over the next  years it is estimated that the countrys reserves are around  million barrels of crude oil which would increase from  to  million according to calculations of the president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers julio cesar vera the current production basket in the country is basically made up of heavy crude oils according to ecopetrol figures the countrys average daily production ranges from  barrels per day of which it is estimated that  correspond to heavy crude oils that are the lowest priced in international markets in addition to the above the exploitation activity is far from the coasts vera assured that with the startup of the fracking projects the oil potential of the magdalena medio region could be exploited with excellent quality crude and would open the door to the expansion of the barrancabermeja refinery whose main problem is that there is no availability enough crude to load it it is a strategic project for the country he added the national government and the private sector have completed ten years in the preparation of all technical regulations and contractual regulation in source rock deposits additionally the ministry of the environment has been working on the terms of reference for development with regard to exploration the regulatory framework for exploitation has yet to be refined one of the next projects to be executed would be in charge of conocophilips colombia ventures the

pipeline unit to take records and have access to the well according to bayon who also said that this pipeline was already known with other wells with this the pressure was lowered from  pounds of pressure to  pounds in addition to the installation of a test kit to lower it to  pounds a second measure has to do with mechanically repairing the well we are mobilizing a drilling rig to drill a relief well in a different location it is parallel and intercepts it and allows killing the well from the ground explained the president of the oil companyecopetrol shareholders claim for high costs charged by commission agents the minority shareholders of ecopetrol expressed to the board of directors of the oil company their dissatisfaction with the charges made by the stock brokers for the withdrawal of their dividends which in many cases are low amounts several of the participants in the companys shareholders meeting agreed on the highvalue payments that they must make to commission agents even at times when the company has not had a profit due to these claims the president of the stock exchange bvc juan pablo cordoba said that this is a legitimate concern and that we share not only because people feel that the investment does not pay but that it is a brake to invite colombians to invest in the markets  in this sense it was announced that together with the financial superintendency of colombia work is being done on a reform of the statutes so that users can see a reduction in the administration costs of the shares owned by the minority of ecopetrol some of the commission agents that were indicated for their costs are global securities valores bancolombia among those indicated by the minority of ecopetrol in response to the request cordoba expressed that it is important to seek a solution for the investor who only follows his actions and is longterm so that he does not have to face these onerous costs this happens in important part due to the regulation which generates more costs to the entities which are then retransmitted to the users so one should think about reducing the regulatory demands before the commission agent and that this positive effect is reflected in charges to investors said the president of the bvcecopetrols shareholders meeting approved the distribution of   billion in dividends the shareholders of the state oil company ecopetrol approved the dividend distribution proposal presented by the company consisting of  of the net profit of  which was   billion thus among the majority and minority shareholders approval was

profits will be distributed in two components the growth reserves and the rest will be reserved for new exploration felipe bayon president of the oil company highlighted that these results are the consequence of a year of intense exploratory activity in addition to the savings and efficiency plans that were incurred in the midst of the oil price crisis the figures in  were overwhelming proven reserves grew to  million barrels of oil equivalent  years average life a production of  boe and operating efficiencies of   trillion all these data show that the crisis was properly managed bayon explained that in january  when the stock was at   the company as a whole was worth   billion yesterday when the market closed we see a valuation of   billion that is worth the company of which we are shareholders  the nation that benefits most from the approved dividends is the nation which with  of the companys shares  million titles will receive   billion in addition to the   billion for the

between  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped to  boped this means that they will have a growth of  compared to  production in the meta we had to close  barrels in the past few days but we are going to try to meet that goal that we set ourselves said the president to achieve the production objective ecopetrol expects to have investments of close to us   and us   million of which  will be for production and exploration including a plan of  development wellsthe priority is to serve the communities that have been affected ecopetrol the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon spoke from the companys shareholders meeting on the environmental damage and the problems caused by the outcrop of oil in the la lizama sector in the municipality of barrancabermeja which has already it completes  days and has caused a serious impact on the inhabitants and the flora and fauna of the region as ecopetrol we regret what is happening in lizama and we are absolutely focused on being able to stop the flow of crude in that case we were able to verify that there is a connection between the lizama  well and the atypical outcrop that has been occurring where there are  meters away and somehow underground the crude came to the surface said bayon the president of the company also assured that the company has an operational and technical plan to control the emergency but the priority is to serve the communities and reduce the environmental impact that has been generated by this oil outcrop we had an office in the area so that people can go to express their concerns put their complaints and claims to be able to attend them we are also working with the fishermen and the communities not only in the current situation but also in the recovery remediation and mitigation for the future  indicated the president of the company according to the official  checkpoints and more than  people have already been set up to attend the emergency likewise from the technical point of view three lines of action have been implemented such as reducing the size of the emanation and for that we have to lower the well pressure we have already been doing it and we are finishing the installation of a test equipment that should starting to operate this weekend which will allow us to produce the largest quantity of fluids in a controlled manner and that these do not come out through the outcrop that is the priority  bayon also explained that among the actions that have been implemented to control the emergency the pressure in the well has been lowered from  to  pounds and with the equipment that is being installed it is expected to drop to  pounds or less we are also bringing a team from the united states which will arrive next week to install it on site and be able to mechanically repair the well and seal it permanently since this will allow us to end the flow of oil that is coming out in this area the president of ecopetrol assured that internal investigations are already beginning with people independent of the company to determine the causes of the emergency there are many hypotheses because problems could arise with the well for example in issues such as overpressure and even seismic movements that occurred in the first days of march what we cannot do is speculate on this and that is why we need to understand from the technical thing was what happened to be able to fix it and draw the conclusions so that in the long term these problems do not recur and operate safely bayon saidthey supervise and open an inquiry to the ecopetrol company for an environmental emergency in santander the fourth labor court of the bucaramanga circuit accepted a tutela action against ecopetrol for the environmental impact caused by the oil spill in santander likewise anla ordered a preliminary inquiry to the company for the same fact in the first case daniel velandia a law student was the one who filed a tutelage of the oil company due to the serious effects that this emergency caused on the ecosystem we seek to immediately cease environmental impact and the protection of fundamental rights such as health water and a healthy environment within the expectations of flora and fauna we cannot allow such damage to continue to be perpetrated community velandia told blu radio on the other hand anla demanded that ecopetrol reinforce the management measures that are being given to the problem through a statement the entity stated that that it immediately adopt the environmental control and management measures in the contingency that has been occurring in the la fortuna district of the municipality of barrancabermeja the director of anla claudia victoria gonzalez hernandez explained that the management measures seek a more efficient collection and cleaning and the increase of equipment to control the source of the contingency so that the contamination of the water bodies does not increase the official added that the entity asked the company for information to determine the causes of the incident reports to advance the evaluation of the impact and define a recovery plan as well as other data to establish the status of air quality and information on the relationship of the wells located in meanwhile the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon assured that the company has an operational and technical plan to control the emergency but the a priority is to serve the communities and reduce the environmental impact that has been generated by this oil outcrop the office of the attorney general of the nation sets a summons according to colprensa in the face of the emergency in the vicinity of the la lizama  well operated by ecopetrol in santander the office of the attorney general of the nation summoned an emergency meeting to the minister of environment and sustainable development luis gilberto murillo urrutia to the director of the national environmental licensing authority anla claudia victoria gonzalez hernandez and the president of the oil company felipe bayon pardo to seek a way out of the environmental crisis that caused the oil spill the control entity asked the anla to order the oil company to suspend exploration and exploitation activities in the area initiate actions in the area to address the incident that has seriously affected the fauna and flora and carry out studies that determine the technical and scientific reason for the oil emanation  in addition the public ministry requested a detailed report of the preventive measures initiated by ecopetrol to stop the outcrops of hydrocarbons in the la lizama area and its surroundings the control body also required a list of the effects on the health of neighboring communities and the environmental impacts to the landscape soils water resources and air which have been identified so far by the emanation of crude oil and what wildlife rescue efforts are being carried out to address the emergency  the public ministry also required a report to establish whether the measures to address the emergency were contained in the contingency plan presented by ecopetrol and whether they have been sufficient to mitigate and prevent the environmental impact caused by the oil spillcomptrollers office had warned ecopetrol of environmental risks for  days ecopetrol has been facing an environmental crisis due to oil leaks originating from well  in campo lizama in barrancabermeja santander which affected nearby properties the lizama stream and the sogamoso river although according to the national environmental licensing authority anla and what ecopetrol has reported that well is currently inactive the state oil company has known at least since  the problems associated with the lizama field the audit carried out by the comptroller general of the republic cgr on the status of ecopetrol in  during the presidency of juan carlos echeverry revealed a finding according to which ecopetrol did not physically abandon the wells of the  exploitation program which he made before the national hydrocarbons agency anh despite the fact that the regulations on the matter indicate that they should be plugged and dismantled immediately although it is not about well  which caused the environmental difficulties that the companys environmental work is currently targeting the report which was published in  indicated that the abandonment plan for well  was not indicated of this field a fact that denotes shortcomings in the planning and management of well abandonment an essential activity for environmental conservation the same could be happening with other wells and that is why among the  measures that anla asked ecopetrol to comply with is the review of other wells specifically            and  from campo lisama between  and  although ecopetrols response in  compared to the audit carried out by the comptrollers office in  was the lack of budget in full operational adjustment of the company due to the low crude oil prices the control body considered that in the understanding that they had been previously planned the resources to carry it out should also have been available the correct closures and the abandonment of the wells three years after this audit the anla opens an environmental inquiry against the oil company after requests made by the attorney generals office at the same time that it was requested that immediately adopt environmental control and management measures  in fact the attorney generals office summoned the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon the minister of the environment luis gilberto murillo and to the director of anla claudia victoria gonzalez to talk about environmental damage monitoring has been done for the operation of the control points and ecopetrol management actions as well as the relocation of the population and the review that there is no impact on intakes and aqueducts said gonzalez last week bayon indicated that they are working on three lines of action to mitigate the impacts and collect the oil the company seeks to relieve pressure at the wellhead we have a continuous pipeline unit to take records and have access to the well said bayon a second measure is to mechanically repair the well a drilling rig is being mobilized to drill a relief well in a different location which being parallel intercepts it and allows killing the well from underground he said the latter would be implemented this weekecopetrol and epm were the companies that registered the most profits although grupo exito ecopetrol grupo sura grupo argos and avianca

hydroelectric plants while the transmission and distribution segments were more stable for the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon the figure of   billion was reached thanks to the work done on costs and even when the price of brent was  lower in addition the company reached its production goal of  barrels per day and that it invested us   billion especially in the exploration and production segment in fact these results will allow the oil company to invest at least   billion this year to increase hydrocarbon reserves and production and capture the benefits of a more favorable

allocated for investments on the contrary colombinas performance did not allow her to add income or profits in part due to the drop in sales in colombia thus the cali firm registered   billion in revenues  and   million in profits  in the financial sector the results of grupo sura showed a good performance in sales with an increase of  that amounted to   billion although earnings fell  even so the holding company will invest us   million this year about us   million will go to suramericana us   million to sura asset management and us   million to sura ventures the president of grupo sura david bojanini assured that in the case of sura the company will focus on the development of new channels and products and the strengthening of the brandgood times come to ecopetrol few companies in the business history of colombia have had the importance of ecopetrol especially now that it is not only the golden goose of the state but also the savings bank of many shareholders who retain their value papers through shares it goes without saying that what happens in ecopetrol truly affects the bulk of colombians in many ways budgetary and investments in the secondary market the last shareholders meeting was a sign of the importance of the company the news was not the approved dividend of   or the ambitious investment plan but the optimism about the future of the company after the timely intervention that thinned its structure and made a savings plan that is already showing results the investments of the joint venture for the next term will be between us   million and us   million at the same time that it outlined a major expansion plan in the foreign market it is not enough to detect the move of the current top management to get into power generation by far one of the most strategic initiatives in the history of the oil company the new stage of ecopetrol is marked by real events that suggest better times such as its international expansion particularly mexico and brazil its energy initiative its savings plan but the most important thing is the matrix work with its associated companies such as reficar cenit and bioenergy all of them companies that are in good health and that play an important role for the economy the only thing that is looming like a cloud is the little diversification in other sectors because it would not be bad for ecopetrol to get into more futuristic issues such as solar or wind energy just to mention that it cannot all be oil or refining it is a crisisproof company which has managed to face competition corruption and a bad price outlook and one of the signs is that its production continues to increase last year it was  barrels of crude per day and this year the oil company wants to reach  barrels in addition the share of the state company is also going through a good time since only so far this year it has risen  in its price reaching   while on january  it was at   it must be taken into account that in september of last year the price of the title had reached   so the rebound in just six months has been almost   this recovery has been accompanied by the rise in the prices of a barrel of oil both wti and brent in the case of the former in september the figure was us   while today the price of a barrel reaches levels of us   us   more in one semester the brent benchmark was in the order of us   in september while today it is trading at about us   per barrel these figures seem to indicate that ecopetrols lean cows are in the past and that future plans show a better time for the countrys largest state company however the recovery of the share price and of the barrel must be accompanied by security in its operations since it is not possible to have good figures when armed groups continue to attack the companys infrastructurethe country would receive revenues of   trillion if brent holds according to calculations released earlier this year by the minister of finance mauricio cardenas each dollar of increase in the price of oil represents tax revenues of   million for the following year in order to evaluate whether the country would be increasing its income due to price movements so far in  lr averaged the price of brent crude and compared it with the price estimated by the government in the mediumterm fiscal framework mfmp  according to this exercise if the price trend continues throughout the year the  fiscal scenario would add   trillion since the average price of crude oil so far this year is us   while the spot price assumed by the government is us   for diego franco president of franco group the rise in prices is a temporary issue and not a true rebound so it will fall again the price is going to be demotivated because the effects that keep it up are temporary and they are news that made it react i dont think it will decrease to levels of us   or us   i would think it will be close to us   he said it is important to mention that as a consequence of this increase in oil prices the dollar has devalued since there is an inverse correlation between both assets this increase in prices has also caused production to increase as there are more resources for exploration and for extracting heavier crude oils the increase in prices has benefited the extraction of crude in the united states where it is heavier as they are not part of the organization of oil exporting countries opec they could increase their supply and put pressure on prices to fall again  explained juan david ballen director of investigations at casa de bolsa according to the ministry of mines an average of  barrels per day were produced in january an amount higher than the goal set by the government for this year in the mfmp which is  barrels per day on the contrary in february an average of  barrels a day were produced the contrasts diego franco president of franco group in january highs were reached that had not been seen since  then there was a decline and until today they have rebounded the price moves by news and is shortterm on the export side so far only the report for january is known in which when comparing them with the same month of the previous year a negative variation of  is evidenced however if prices continue to rise it is estimated that foreign sales of crude will increase finally ecopetrols share has appreciated with the increase in prices since in september it was at   when crude oil was at us   now that crude is at   the stock is up to  this week the sanctioning package will be known in the escape of lizama the minister of the environment luis gilberto murillo pointed out in dialogue with the fm that despite the fact that it is expected that in two or three weeks the cleaning of  of the oil spill from the wells of the lizama field can be controlled and completed what is beginning to be analyzed at the hands of the humboldt institute is the real scope of the environmental damage the restoration measures and the compensation to those affected for this it is also expected that in april the results of the investigations being carried out by the national environmental licensing agency will be known in which it will be analyzed whether ecopetrol took the necessary measures to prevent this spill now despite the lack of time to know this document the minister announced that there is already a schedule of how the sanctioning package against ecopetrol would be filed related article the comptrollers office had warned ecopetrol of environmental risks failure to update the contingency plan is the first process the second is due to the failure in the emergency and the third due to the lack of a robust response and for not taking additional measures when we were here last week in that sense this week there would be penalties for the first measure and i think i dont want to anticipate it but there is all sufficient evidence to show that the contingency plan was not updated despite the requirement the second series of measures comes a week later and these have to do with the response of the oil company once the leak was known and the third package of measures would come in the third week of april in which they are already analyzed more the causes of the tragedy concluded murillocormagdalena is alert to possible contamination by oil spill due to the hydrocarbon spill that occurred several weeks ago in the la lizama  well in the rural area of barrancabermeja cormagdalena is alert to the possible contamination of water sources since traces of crude oil could reach the magdalena river through the sogamoso river we regret the situation and we have notified ecopetrol about the importance of taking the necessary contingent measures to avoid everywhere that contamination reaches the magdalena river since the river is a source of life and a water supply for multiple populations settled throughout of its banks said alfredo varela de la rosa executive director of cormagdalena the ministry of environment and sustainable development and the technical team of the subdirectorate of sustainable development and navigation of the corporation carried out an inspection last monday at the  control points installed by ecopetrol and at the  barricades where a large part of the pollution according to varela the inspections revealed that there are no traces of hydrocarbons in the magdalena river however the team of the subdirectorate of sustainable development and navigation of the corporation will maintain permanent monitoring in the area together with ecopetrol the ministry of the environment the national authority for environmental licenses anla the regional autonomous corporation of santander cas  the directorate of risk management and the fishermen associations of the regionminister of finance announces his retirement from the boards of directors of ecopetrol and fdn the minister of finance and public credit mauricio cardenas announced his retirement as of today from the boards of directors of ecopetrol and the national development finance company fdn this decision is part of the commitments that colombia made with the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd as it seeks that stateowned companies are managed with greater independence the objective is that the state can manage its companies without facing conflicts of interest since the national government acts as a regulator in these sectors as well as avoiding advantages over private companies minister cardenas explained according to the document corporate governance in colombia published by the oecd in  the colombian government promised to withdraw the ministers from the boards of directors of stateowned companies for this reason in a period of three years the government went from having  ministers on the boards in march  to having none in ecopetrol the representation of the ministry of finance was assumed by the director of state participations a position currently held by camilo barco munoz in the fdn board the representation will be in charge of the general vice minister a position that today is occupied by paula acosta marquez who due to the commitments acquired with the oecd not to increase the participation of the vice ministers in the boards of directors resigned from that of la previsora compania de segurosecopetrol controlled the oil sludge and gas spill in barrancabermeja ecopetrol announced that after the  barrel spill which was mixed with sludge and rainwater the emergency is under control and the outcrop of sludge oil and gas that occurred between march  and  in the la lisama field in the la fortuna district barrancabermeja municipality he has already stopped felipe bayon president of ecopetrol after visiting the emanation point and the different control points he confirmed that not a drop of oil is falling into the water sources in the area according to the company in the same way the company said that the control of the outcrop is due to the work carried out by ecopetrol technicians with the installation of pumping systems and fluid treatment at the point of emission which allow the liquids to be sucked in and prevent them from falling in the la lizama stream the cano muerto and the sogamoso river the installation of three flow lines in the  well allows the fluids to be brought to ecopetrols lisama central station and with a specialized team of well testing it was possible to lower the pressure of the well and reduce the emanation of fluids ecopetrol confirmed to complement these actions of the contingency plan in the next few hours a specialized team called snubbing unit will arrive in colombia which allows wells to be intervened under high pressure conditions a team of specialized professionals will accompany the installation and commissioning of this equipment to plug the well permanentlycardenas leaves the board of directors of ecopetrol and the fdn with the purpose of fulfilling the commitment that the state companies are managed with greater independence than the government made to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the minister of finance and public credit mauricio cardenas announced his retirement yesterday immediately from the boards of directors of ecopetrol and the financiera de desarrollo nacional fdn the objective is that the state can manage its companies without facing conflicts of interest since the government acts as a regulator in these sectors as well as avoiding advantages over private companies said cardenas according to the document corporate governance in colombia released by this international organization last year colombia undertook to withdraw the different ministers from the boards of directors of state companies in this way the government went from having  ministers on the boards of directors in  to having none three years later in the case of ecopetrol the representation of the ministry of finance was in an institutional capacity headed by the director of state participations a position held by camilo barco munoz on the other hand in the fdn meeting the representation will be in charge of the general deputy minister paula acosta marquez this in turn in response to the commitments signed with the oecd not to increase the participation of vice ministers in the boards of directors also resigned from the board of la previsora compania de segurosecopetrols share has appreciated  so far this year the good results for the third quarter of  were confirmed last week at ecopetrol after it announced a net profit of   billion and a dividend of   per share this was thanks to the recovery in international crude prices and the optimization of the companys processes among other things which have the companys share in a range of   a tough one that was not played for more than five weeks  when the year began the oil company had a price of   per unit and currently it has achieved a  appreciation in its price thanks to the announcements about the extension of the supply reduction agreements of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which has pushed brent prices again to levels of us   per barrel four years ago when the price of the london reference barrel was close to its historical maximum precisely at us   per barrel the ecopetrol share was trading at   however due to the fall in prices in january  it bottomed out and reached   per unit in the opinion of juan camilo dauder analyst at credicorp capital it may not be a good time since the current market price does not respond to the fundamental of   so that despite the good results of the company we see that it is possible that the market is paying a premium against fair value without an obvious reason however a point that must be taken into account according to analysts are the projections of crude oil prices in the international market because saudi arabia and other nations have pledged to extend production cuts until next year which may keep the price of the commodity close to todays levels which may lead to  being a very good year for the oil company geb sold part of its shares as part of the democratization program of  of grupo de energia de bogotas shares the bvc reported that  shares were sold at a price of   each which yielded income of   million for the district colcap gained  the most valued share of the day on the colombian stock exchange was the preferred one from bancolombia which gained  and closed at a price of   on the contrary the species that fell the most during the day was fabricato which had a negative variation of  and ended the day at   lastly the colcap index gained  and reached  units animals have died due to oil spill since last march  an outcrop of crude has occurred in ecopetrols lizama  well for which more than  barrels of oil mud water and gases were discharged in this rural area of barrancabermeja claudia gonzalez hernandez director of the national environmental licensing authority anla made known how the situation is and what is the procedure to follow what did la anla find on her visit to the area since march  we have been monitoring and accompanying the containment and control activities because until now we are in the first contingency phase where the source is being controlled and that the hydrocarbon does not enter the bodies of water the impact has been very important around  animals have died and we have reports of nine people who have seen their health affected due to the gases since the  of this month the area has been evacuated and some  animals have been rescued related article ecopetrol controlled the oil sludge and gas spill in barrancabermeja how has the impact on water sources and air quality been  bodies of water and up to  kilometers from the sogamoso river were contaminated although no crude arrived as such there is presence of traces we have permanent monitoring of the air but we still have not received results from the laboratory based on your research has it been determined what caused the well to outcrop no it is an outcrop  meters from a well that was sealed which means that there is a material and some deposits that we do not know what is stimulating them first we must determine what caused it and if any of ecopetrols operational activities was the one that caused this overpressure now they are in contingency what is next in the process once the contingency is over the areas restoration plan comes which will last a long time because there must be no traces of hydrocarbons and the vegetation must be recovered additionally in parallel the sanctioning process is developed which is to determine the responsibility of ecopetrol in the event and its fines how long could it take for the area to recover such a situation has never happened in colombia so it is very difficult to know for sure also it depends on what has been affected as the vegetation dies they have to carry out a process of rehabilitation of the area it is necessary to recover the margins of the ravines and the issue of habitat of the species typical of the area must be improved there may be repopulation work which must be with the same species in the basin in the event that groundwater has been contaminated the process will be very extensive as it takes a long time to decontaminate groundwater the recovery process itself will take several years as it takes at least six months for the oil to decompose how is the sanctioning process going we have just started the sanctioning process then comes the formulation of charges which we hope to do today or tomorrow then ecopetrol presents its discharges and according to the decision taken we would pass the fine the proceeds from this fine go to the national treasury additionally within the sanctioning process in addition to fining them we can request compensation and restoration measures in addition to those they must comply with that is the company must pay the contingency plan the recovery and compensation plan the fine and other restoration measures in networks they ask why we do not issue daily fines but to be able to do so i have to have completed the entire sanctioning process which however expeditious is five months the contrasts luis gilberto murillo minister of environment and sustainable development the instruction that i have given to anla is to immediately demand that ecopetrol make temporary compensation and compensation to the families if it is found that ecopetrol was responsible for the increase in pressure in the well or that it was not properly sealed the exact value of the penalty will be taken in five months how much could the fine be this is calculated based on the assets of the company so it will be significant for example the fine to drummond was   million and it was for a very specific affectation in this it is a much greater affectationecopetrol noted that there are not two new oil outcrops in lizama inhabitants of the town of la fortuna in barrancabermeja denounced that last night in the vicinity of the outcrop of well  in lizama two new oil fluids appeared after a couple of explosions that were heard at night the president of the lizama community action board rafael antonio quintero told caracol radio that near well  there were two new emanations and that the area is cordoned off mud water and oil are coming out said the social leader who requested support for the inhabitants of the sector known as pozo quemado as he indicated that only three families have been relocated for its part ecopetrol issued a statement in which it assured that the outcrop continues in the process of reducing pressure and to date it is confirmed that the level of the fluids contained in the place continues to decrease the national oil company clarified that the fluids are confined at the site of the event with no risk of overflowing to the water sources and explained that the additional hole located about  centimeters away is part of the same outcrop system which it is controlled according to the company since march  the companys technicians have managed to contain the flow of mud crude oil and water into the la lizama and cano muerto streams and since that date no additional dumping has been registered to these water sourcesminister of the environment requests the prosecutors office to criminally investigate the oil spill the minister of the environment luis gilberto murillo formally requested the attorney general of the nation nestor humberto martinez to carry out a criminal investigation for the oil spill in the lizama  well of ecopetrol likewise the minister asked the attorney general of the nation fernando carrillo to advance disciplinary proceedings against public officials who in the face of the facts have incurred an irregularity through letters to both officials he also requested support to investigate the environmental effects in the areaanla ordered a sanctioning process against ecopetrol in a statement the national environmental licensing authority anla announced that it had ordered the initiation of an environmental administrative procedure of a sanctioning nature against the company ecopetrol sa for the events that occurred in the lisama oil field located in the jurisdiction of the municipality of barrancabermeja department of santander according to the entity the decision is made based on facts such as not having activated the contingency plan nor executed and controlled the emergency according to the real magnitude of the event of march   at the palmas de colombia  located in the town of la fortuna jurisdiction of the municipality of barrancabermeja as well as not having reported on time the circumstances that aggravated the initial conditions of the reported contingency and that demonstrated the real magnitude of the event that occurred having communicated the situation as controlled on march   hampering the monitoring activity by anla although the company reported the contingency event that occurred on march   at the palmas de colombia property according to the information provided in subsequent reports it seems that the company did not report on time the real magnitude of the contingency that occurred and that it also reported as controlled on march   it hampered the monitoring activity by this authority preventing the exercise of the functions of visiting and monitoring the event in real time since if the magnitude of the event was known on the part of the anla technical personnel would have been immediately commissioned to the place of the event with the purpose of taking measures of prevention and control according to the third article of resolution  of november   expressed the order issued by the national environmental authority in its decision the anla requires the national hydrocarbons agency anh to send the information it has in its possession related to the lisama  well located in la fortuna jurisdiction of the municipality of barrancabermeja for the period from  to  and the other wells that are located within a radius of  meters near the well in question and finally announced that it will communicate its decision to the delegate attorney for environmental and agrarian affairs the government of santander the municipality of barrancabermeja and the santander regional autonomous corporation casthere are  vice ministers on the boards of directors of state companies with the commitment to strengthen the institutional framework governance and transparency in the countrys public companies since   ministers or officials of ministerial rank and three vice ministers have left the boards of directors where the state has a majority participation the last of them was the head of the treasury and public credit portfolio mauricio cardenas who said goodbye to his role in the small tables of ecopetrol and the national development finance fdn the objective is that the state can manage its companies without facing conflicts of interest since the government acts as a regulator in these sectors as well as avoiding advantages over private companies explained cardenas this measure which is part of colombias strategy for its incorporation into the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd began with the issuance of the document conpes  of  which establishes the implementation of a general policy of state property in it the state pledged to strengthen its role as a shareholder and raise corporate governance standards although in this period the path to achieve adherence to the club of good practices has been overwhelming with the elimination of all ministers from the boards of directors according to information provided by the ministry of finance there are still  vice ministers who appear as members currently these spokespersons are present in the following state companies with majority state participation icetex artesanias de colombia and banco agrario both with two members isa fiduprevisora positiva satena sociedad hotelera tequendama fdn and fondo nacional guarantee fng of note for example is the participation of the vice minister of business development daniel arango angel as president of both the board of directors of artesanias de colombia and the fng likewise the vice ministers of education infrastructure of the ministry of transportation or finance among others form part of the boards it is assumed that the ministers and vice ministers who assume their respective portfolios are technically authorized persons and therefore with sufficient responsibility and powers to assume membership in these boards however in the political sphere this representation could interfere with decisionmaking for this reason it is recommended from the best international practices to take a distance between the public policy maker and their membership in the boards  indicated victor hugo malagon chaplain of the universidad del rosario and president of the forum of presidents the contrasts jose manuel restrepo rector of the universidad del rosario eliminating the ministers of the boards of directors is not only a requirement of access to the oecd but an opportunity to improve our way of doing public management gustavo yepes director of management and csr at the externado de colombia university the most important benefit of this policy of eliminating state officials is to avoid conflict of interest which is very significant in these cases the same opinion is shared by the director of management and csr of the faculty of business administration of the externado de colombia university gustavo yepes who argued that this decision helps to avoid conflicts of interest of officials a minister representing the colombian state may be compromising his objectivity by being part of a board he explained company value currently the equity value that the nation has invested in  companies amounts to   billion in  of them the government has a majority stake they generate  of gdp income and have assets of   billion some stand out such as ecopetrol isa bancoldex colpensiones national savings fund finagro findeter and in them ministries such as finance have participation that of transportation mines and energy or that of agriculture and rural development how much do officials receive for each session the remuneration for each session of the board of directors that the ministers or vice ministers receive varies according to each state company according to the annual report of companies of the nation  in the national savings fund fna and in national postal services they receive two smmlv legal monthly minimum wages in force for each session in the national development finance fdn or in positiva seguros four and at ecopetrol they receive up to six for attending a single dayecopetrol denied new oil outcrops at the la lizama well after  days since the lizama  well located in la fortuna district of barrancabermeja santander had an outcrop monitoring systems are maintained in the area and contingency measures continue which have involved the displacement of people and animal rescue likewise the authorities have been present in the area to investigate and determine what caused the spill and the responsibility of ecopetrol at dawn on tuesday residents of the district denounced that in the vicinity of the well outcrop there were two new oil fluids after a couple of explosions that were heard at night however the oil company responded through a statement that since tuesday an additional hole has been observed about  centimeters away from the initial opening which is part of the same outcrop which was controlled since last  of march an estimated  barrels were spilled which were mixed with mud and rainwater likewise ecopetrol reiterated that the outcrop continues in the process of reducing pressure and to date it is confirmed that the level of the fluids contained in the place continues to decrease likewise the oil company pointed out that the liquid is trapped and there is no risk the snubbing unit equipment is added to the control measures which is used to intervene wells in high pressure conditionswith this equipment the well will be permanently plugged just as the contingency plan has been carried out different investigations have been initiated to clarify what happened we have ordered an internal investigation with external personnel independent of the operation so that we can understand what happened why what happened it happened and above all to prevent things like these from being repeated in the future said felipe bayon president of ecopetrol for his part the minister of environment and sustainable development  luis gilberto murillo formally requested the attorney generals office and the attorney generals office to support the investigation to be carried out by the national environmental licensing authority anla he asked both entities to carry out investigations to identify and accuse those responsible for the tragedy in addition it noted that ecopetrol and the national hydrocarbons agency anh knew of failures in the well casing and its mechanical problems but did not notify environmental authorities the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol we have ordered an internal investigation with external personnel which allows us to understand what happened and why it happened it is worth mentioning that to determine responsibilities you must first know what caused the accident on the other hand the country has already begun to develop demonstrations against the environmental disaster in bogota in front of the headquarters of the ministry of the environment a sitin was called to demand that the state resolve the emergency more quickly and penalize those responsible mobilization through social networks the environmental situation in the rural district of barrancabermeja has generated indignation and mobilization through social networks through the avaaz platform requests have been created for the government to accelerate its management in solving this problem likewise through twitter a hashtag has become a trend in which minister murillo is asked to resign however he is not the only official who has been asked to leave his post as environmental organizations are also demanding it from the director of anla the president of the anh and the minminasecopetrol announces reinforcement

dams at the outcrop located in the la fortuna district in barrancabermeja as the entity announced in a statement four pools were also built at the same point to collect evacuated fluids he also added that these works are aimed at preventing the possible effects of increased rains in the area and the operational works being carried out in the lisama  well which will temporarily increase the level of fluids in the outcrop ecopetrol also took the opportunity to inform people who refrain from approaching the place to guarantee their safety thus increasing the security perimeterecopetrol reinforced the crude outcrop in lizama with three new dams ecopetrol reinforced with three new dams the oil outcrop that has already completed  days in the la lizama sector in barrancabermeja and which has caused a social economic and environmental impact in the magdalena medio region these works are aimed at preventing the possible effects of increased rains in the area and the operational work being carried out in the lizama  well which will temporarily increase the level of fluids in the outcrop the company said the state oil company also indicated that four pools were built at the same point to collect the fluids that are evacuated by the outcrop and be disposed of safely and in compliance with environmental regulations likewise it is already working on the installation of the snubbing unit equipment and a set called bop valves to control pressure which arrived this wednesday in the area from the united states and with which it is expected to intervene the well at high pressures and permanently seal the oil outcrop this units specific mission is to contribute to the process of identifying the causes that generate overpressure in the well in a safe way for people the environment and equipment all this to reach the final stage of sealing the well  explained edgar mora freyre head of the completion department of the vice presidency of development and production of ecopetrol finally the company reiterated that the outcrop of mud oil and gas is controlled and since march  there has been no drop in fluids in water sources which is why the cleaning work of the la lizama and cano muerto streams is currently progressing ecopetrol presented a balance of environmental and social care in the area affected by the spill after the spill of the lizama well in santander ecopetrol issued a statement presenting the balance of actions carried out to mitigate the damage of the oil irrigation in the la fontana area where according to the oil company  people from  families have been relocated  the company indicated that in principle a sociodemographic characterization of  housing units was carried out and that each one of the families is receiving adequate accommodation food as well as transportation services and laundry services according to ecopetrol the areas of the houses are being guarded and food and water are provided for the domestic animals likewise the

growing the mayor in charge of barrancabermeja francy alvarez after an overflight over the affected area assured that it was observed that the emanation crater in well  of la lizama would be larger the municipalitys technical team also suggested that there is a possibility that the land could collapse therefore the mayor raised a call to the ministry of mines and the national hydrocarbons agency anh to be present at the site of the environmental disaster and can help with the solution to the outcrop as she recently told the media  the crater is getting bigger and bigger a situation that worries because the report of the technical team of the mayors office says that there may be a collapse or a greater instability of the terrain said alvarez the president added neither the minister of mines nor those of the anh have been present in the territory as competent authorities on the issue of hydrocarbons we ask that they give us a real report of the situation that happens in the well because this issue is already very technical and it is out of our hands  alvarez also asked ecopetrol to ensure that the measures they are implementing are appropriate to solve the spillecopetrol ruled out further subsidence of the land in a well in lizama related article crude outcrop crater in barrancabermeja would be growing following the statement of the mayor in charge of barrancabermeja francy alvarez who after an overflight over the affected area assured that the emanation crater in well  of la lizama would be larger ecopetrol reported that one of the most renowned geotechnicians in the country concluded that the terrain is strong resistant and competent the statement comes from jaime suarez a civil engineer and geotechnist from rutgers university new jersey with a masters degree in science and a professor at the industrial university of santander uis recognized in the country for being one of the most reputable specialists in the analysis of the behavior of soils the company said in a press release as explained by the company by competent they mean that the rocks are hard and stable so suarez ruled out the existence of subsidence that is there is no evidence of progressive subsidence of the land the expert assures that the only observed fall of the walls of the outcrop a phenomenon caused by natural wear when in contact with the fluids contained there but not related to eventual underground and deep movements of the rocks this phenomenon causes enlarge the area of the outcrop complemented ecopetrol in the same way the company explained that as a complementary measure ecopetrol will install a hood in the outcrop that will allow a controlled targeting of the gases that emanate and avoid the risks associated with said emissions likewise the company affirmed that to deepen the analysis of the terrain radar geoelectric surface seismic and geophysical studies will be carried out and that the company also carries out  monitoring of the terrain and the behavior of the outcrop and from the lisama  wellthe well is totally sealed there is no outcrop no emanations minambiente almost a month later since the emergency began the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon confirmed that the outcrop of the lisama  well in la fortuna santander is already sealed we confirmed that since yesterday at  pm the outcrop and the lisama  well stopped flowing there are no emanations from the outcrop he said the news was verified by the minister of the environment luis gilberto murillo who in the review of the conditions pointed out that the gas emissions that existed at that time were also controlled so it is totally sealed controlled and the threat is totally eliminated  that is very good news not only for this area but for the region and the country and it shows that we are complying step by step with the entire strategy and plan that we had determined with ecopetrol anla and with all the entities of the national government to overcome this crisis  although the well is sealed bayon explained that work on the site must continue with the specialized snubbing unit equipment in this way the well will be closed in a definitive and controlled manner the equipment is expected to come into operation in the next few days the minister also announced that the other measures continue to advance simultaneously such as the investigation that was opened against ecopetrol the cleaning of the area and the verification and inspection actions in the verification downstream the ministry and other authorities also reported that a decrease in oil was evidenced on the surface of the la lizama and cano muerto streams the oil spill began on march  when the lisama  well presented an outcrop despite being inactive since  according to the oil company since march  crude has stopped falling and estimates that around  barrels were lost in one year the colombian stock exchange lost  shareholders every quarter the number of investors in companies listed on the colombian stock exchange has been decreasing between september and december  the companies listed on the stock market lost the resources of  people which could affect the degree of negotiations in the bvc which in several cases is already at very low levels the company that most reduced its number of investors was ecopetrol which now has  fewer partners although it is worth mentioning that as of december it still has  shareholders and this represents more than half of private partners in the local stock market followed by the oil company two of the three organizations that have lost the most shareholders belong to the financial sector grupo aval among its ordinary and preferred shareholders now has  partners  fewer than in september a similar situation occurred at banco davivienda which in the last quarter of  lost about  investors among the  securities analyzed that are traded on the stock market there is a total of  which according to andres moreno a consultant on stock exchange issues except for ecopetrol are levels similar to those presented in  the expert pointed out that this this situation is due to several reasons but one of the main ones is that the commission agents have turned their commercial efforts to sell collective investment funds because it is much less cumbersome more profitable and fewer mistakes are made this makes people small investors sell their shares and put their resources in the fics which are growing at a very good rate said the expert another factor that led to more than  people selling their papers in  has to do with costs according to the experts despite the fact that both the firms and the stock exchange itself have made an effort to reduce them they are still very high it is even the most expensive square in the world said moreno who added that those securities passed from the hands of ordinary people to mainly pension funds and international funds other analysts consulted indicated that the problem also has to do with the scarce supply of new issuers since for several years no company has entered the bvc and if some have left for different reasons among these the liquidity according to omar suarez an analyst at casa de bolsa there were also many people who sought to take advantage of the revaluation that different species had such as ecopetrol which in one year doubled its value and went out to sell during the past year who added that since this type of situation could affect the negotiation amounts and the liquids of the market it is important that the bvc continues giving incentives to natural persons so that they continue to have an important participation another expert who asked not to be cited assured that very few shares are actually liquid although the stock market says there are about  there are really two or three that put the trading amounts on a daily basis he explained if the loss of partners is taken into account in proportional terms canacol was the one that lost the most investors since the number fell  in the last quarter followed by promigas which lost  of its shareholders in the total of the year in addition to isagen which was withdrawn from the market and carvajals preferential due to the takeover bid the companies in which the most investors sold their securities were bvc which lost  the preferential of cemargos which fell  and bancolombias preferential which ended the year with  fewer shareholders for this reason moreno explained that the most important thing is that the bvc continue in the work of looking for new issuers that give dynamism to the negotiations and propitiate the conditions for investors to arrive the contrasts omar suarez analyst at casa de bolsa there were many people trying to take advantage of a moment in which various shares gained value as in the case of ecopetrol colcap rose  in the first day of april on monday in the stock market the colcap index had a positive variation of  which placed it at  units among the most valued shares is the preferred one from bancolombia which rose  and closed at   this was followed by the grupo argos species which rose  on the other hand the canacol energy title lost  and ended at   the most traded share of the day was that of ecopetrol which moved more than   million and gained  in its priceanla will present a statement of charges against ecopetrol for the oil spill one month after the oil outcrop in ecopetrols lizama  well in the la fortuna district santander the national environmental licensing authority anla will present a statement of charges against the oil company according to the entity this decision is made because ecopetrol did not activate the contingency plan or execute or control the emergency according to the real magnitude of the event on march  the first report made by ecopetrol on march  said that  barrels had been spilled and that it was under control claudia gonzalez hernandez director of anla told lr in recent days the environmental authority also points out that the company hampered the monitoring activity of the anla by not having timely reported the initial circumstances of the contingency and by communicating on march  that the situation was under control for these same actions ecopetrol would also have obstructed the actions of the santander regional autonomous corporation and the municipal risk management committee according to a statement issued by anla if it had known the magnitude of the situation it would have immediately commissioned a technical group at the scene of the emergency to take prevention and control measures additionally the decision of the environmental entity is motivated by the factor that ecopetrols management allegedly affected the la lizama stream cano la muerte and  kilometers of the sogamoso river the soil and the fauna and flora also due to the possible effects on the communities that inhabit the region and their socioeconomic environmentaccording to congress the environmental crisis due to the lizama spill would be overcome in august the environmental crisis that the lizama sector is experiencing due to the oil spill from well  was widely debated this tuesday in the fifth committee of the senate where it was reported that despite the fact that the sealing has already begun only until after half a year the problem would be overcome the political control debate that had its first session on tuesday and is expected to continue tomorrow was cited by the senator of the democratic pole jorge enrique robledo who assured that this outcrop of crude seen in the lizama is the largest that had ever been seen in the country robledo assured that the state oil company should be responsible for the damage caused and drew attention to the hypothesis that an increase in pressure influenced for which he asked to establish causes and responsibilities and guarantee the wellbeing of the communities as a third conclusion according to the polo senator this entire crisis should not be manipulated to bring the issue to privatize ecopetrol the senator of the mira party gloria estela diaz says that in the investigation of what happened it is clear how far the responsibility of entities such as the ministry of the environment the regional autonomous corporation car the national environmental licensing agency among others the senator of the u party maritza martinez insisted that ecopetrol did not proceed in the correct way to face this situation and considered that the delayed reaction of the anla was due to an error from the oil company the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon stated that we are committed to solving this emergency we are responsible for the definitive closure of the well compensation and support to the communities bayon said on several occasions that the well must be technically abandoned to prevent communication with the surface he also reported that with the arrival of technical assistance from a machinery that comes from the united states the entire formal sealing process will begin but indicated that the entire situation would only be overcome between july and august the company manager said that despite the heavy rain that occurred during the early hours of tuesday some barriers placed at the site of the spill were not displaced that is the oil was not poured back into the waterthe attorney generals office asked ecopetrol for compensation for the damages in lizama the office of the attorney general of the nation filed before the administrative court of santander a group reparation action requesting that ecopetrol respond for the damages caused by the outcrop of hydrocarbons and gases from the lizama  well in the rural area of barrancabermeja the extremely high emanation of hydrocarbons and gases from well  in the lizama field operated by ecopetrol sa caused the very serious injury to legitimate patrimonial and extrapatrimonial interests even irreversible susceptible to be compensated and judicially repaired said the attorney generals office in this sense the public ministry asked that the state oil company be declared administratively and extracontractual responsible for it to repair citizens residents and workers in the areas of influence of the la lisama well that have been affected by the emergency the compensation must also cover the inhabitants of the vicinity of the lizama and cano muerto streams and the sogamoso river located in the rural jurisdiction of the municipalities of barrancabermeja san vicente de chucuri and puerto wilches santander where part of the hydrocarbon reached  the control entity also pointed out that ecopetrol possibly withheld relevant information to avoid the oil spill and underestimated the real magnitude of the disaster this is a collective impact on both ecosystems and people which led to the impact of a great variety of elements necessary for food production fundamental for the population of that region of the country making the need that even greater reparation is imposed since it is reasonably expected that in the future the damages will increase he said according to the public ministry one of the characteristics of environmental damage is that they have a high probability of new effects on human health and the environment after several periods of timeecopetrol and fishermen agree on an environmental recovery strategy in lizama the state oil company ecopetrol and  fishermens associations agreed to build a plan to restore ecosystems affected by the oil outcrop in the lizama sector which generated economic social and environmental damage in the magdalena medio region we agree on the rules of the game for our relationship and the way in which the fishermen are going to help us in solidarity to restore impacted ecosystems we also agreed how we are going to work in coordination in the short medium and long term we want to give fishermen a piece of confidence they can rest easy we will leave the ecosystems in equal or better conditions than they were before the contingency said eduardo uribe vice president of sustainable development at ecopetrol according to the company up to now  fishermen have been linked to cleaning the water sources affected by the release of more than  barrels of crude likewise the fundacion gente ecopetrol has distributed  markets among the fishing families in the area it is expected that in the coming days more than  additional markets will be distributed the  fishermen associations that attended the meeting will deliver the updated list of associated and nonassociated fishermen who will benefit from the aid ecopetrol indicated for her part the legal representative of the el pedral fishermens association jully andrea mora said that mitigation work has already begun in the emergency area at this moment there are  people working to clean the pipe and some area of the river where they are being trained to carry out this work we are making constant progress in the recovery of our natural environment said mora finally ecopetrol indicated that progress is being made in the installation of the snubbing unit equipment that was imported from the united states with which it is intended to permanently seal the lizama  well which generated the emergency during the month of marchcolcap index of the stock market rose  and is close to  points on wednesdays session on the colombian stock exchange the colcap index the most important in the market showed new signs of recovery and approached levels of  units thus during the session the basket had an advance of  and ended the day at  units the highest level since the end of february the best performing stock on the day was banco de bogota which gained  and closed at   per unit this was followed by celcias species which had a positive variation of  and ended at   the top three of the best performing stocks was closed by the grupo aval title with a  appreciation to   per share on the other hand it is worth mentioning that the miners papers were the ones that fell the most since they contracted  and ended the day at   very close was the title of promigas which fell  to settle at   for its part conconcreto lost  of its market capitalization and ended the day at   as is customary in the bvc the most traded share during the session was ecopetrol  which managed to move   million another of the species that had a good flow of negotiation was the preferential one of bancolombia which gained  and moved resources for more than

price of   which represented a decrease of   compared to the trm which for today stands at    the opening in the colombian market was   while its closing was   the minimum price registered on the setfx platform was   and the maximum reached   it is worth mentioning that us   million were negotiated in  transactions which resulted in an average of us   per operation now unlike the developed market currencies that continued to gain ground the dollar index had a rise of  reaching over  points a level considered high by analysts in this way and before signs that the us wants to resolve the trade dispute with china the currency recovered ground against the yen and the swiss franc two safe haven assets similarly it is worth mentioning that oil prices continue to recover and for example the brent benchmark gained  to reach us   per barrelshares of cementos argos ecopetrol and bancolombia protagonists in march the cementos argos share was without a doubt the preferred one among investors in march between the pension fund administrators and individuals they acquired more than   million in papers the afps bought about  of the shares that were traded in the cement company however this title during the past month had a negative variation of  in part due to the sale of   million shares for part of foreigners after the company left the ftse  index the species presented a significant devaluation after the exit of the ftse index due to high sales flows from foreigners that caused the price to fall and perhaps it became an attractive option for other investors said omar suarez manager of equity at casa de bolsa another of the favorite shares for the afps was the preferred one from bancolombia whose securities reached purchases for   million for foreigners the ordinary species of bancolombia was the most acquired with purchases for   million followed by ecopetrol with   million mainly due to the liquidity of both explained suarez it is worth mentioning that the oil companys papers were the most sold by the afps since   million in shares were disposed of historically ecopetrols share has been the most liquid on the stock market said daniel escobar director of the strategy department of global securities and added to the issue of the delivery of the dividend this month it may have motivated the high levels of negotiation of the title  in addition it is necessary to take into account the appreciation of more than  that the share has had during  which can be a sales incentive by natural persons suarez indicated the contrasts omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa cementos argos presented a significant devaluation after the exit of the ftse due to the high sales flows from foreigners daniel escobar director of the global securities strategy department historically ecopetrols share is the most traded on the stock exchange but the issue of the dividend may have motivated the securitys trading levels in turn natural persons double their sales over grupo exito participating in more than  of the companys total net sales indicated the report which incidentally added that on the buyer side natural persons took advantage of the cemargos devaluation and decided to increase their exposure in both common and preferred shares for equivalent amounts of   million and   million  colcap index returns to  units on thursday the colcap index of the colombian stock exchange returned to  points and stood at  after a  appreciation the species that appreciated the most on the day was canacol energy which advanced  and closed at   per unit on the contrary enkas title fell the most losing  the most negotiated papers were those of ecopetrol which moved   millionanla suspends new procedures in the area of influence of the lisama  well the national environmental licensing authority anla preventedly suspended some procedures in the area of influence of the lisama  well until the environmental authority has sufficient technical analysis to determine the absence of risk through a statement anla indicated that the procedures suspended in the area are the drilling of new reinjection and injection wells secondary and tertiary recovery activities or improved recovery and the authorization of environmental licenses or modifications of license or plan of environmental management according to the director of anla claudia gonzalez hernandez this decision seeks to establish that the causes of the contingency will not generate environmental consequences in the other wells and prevent more situations such as those that occurred in that field of exploitation it is important to mention that due to the events that occurred on march  anla is carrying out an environmental sanctioning process against ecopetroloil companies fell in the stock market due to the fall in crude prices on the last day of the week the colcap continued to show signs of recovery as it appreciated  and reached a level of  units a range that had not been reached since the end of february the boost came from various stocks in the financial sector however the good performance of the index was not shared by the shares of the oil companies that after the banco de bogota title which was the one that lost the most falling  and closing at   were the ones that lost the most canacol energy had a drop of  to   and ecopetrol which in turn was the most traded fell  to   in this action more than   million were moved the decline was driven by the fall in oil prices the brent benchmark lost  and ended the week at us   per barrel in turn the wti fell  to us   per unit on the other side of the table was enkas stock which was the best performer for the day the title gained  and closed at   another of the titles that showed good performance during the session was grupo argos which had a positive variation of  to   in addition the miners species was another of the highlights advancing  and closing at  the state oil company reported on the liquidation of ecopetrol global capital slu in spain through a statement published by the financial superintendency ecopetrol sa informed that the liquidation process of the company ecopetrol global capital slu domiciled in spain was perfected the operation was authorized by the board of directors of ecopetrol sa as part of the review process of the corporate structure of its business group as reported by this same means the solemnity of the process is recorded in a public deed of the madrid notary public and is duly registered in the mercantile registry of that city according to the state oil company ecopetrol is the largest company in colombia and generate more than  of the national oil production it is ranked among the  largest oil companies in the world and among the top four in latin americareficars accounts join the comptrollers objections to ecopetrol during the weekend the comptrollers office announced that the net profit of the cartagena refinery reficar for  would not be positive   million but negative    billion since the company would have increased its operating profit thanks to the reversal of the impairment expense recorded in previous years german nova professor and researcher at the national university explained that this is not an illegal practice but indicated that this increases or decreases depreciation as appropriate since if you want to reduce the utility the depreciation will be presented as faster while if you want to increase the utility the depreciation will be slower they are tricks used by those who know a lot about the subject to make up the financial statements in this case the company wanted to change the idea that it had been a bad investment which is how it has been described by various sectors by presenting gains instead of losses he said this is not the first time that the comptrollers office calls ecopetrol or one of its companies attention for practices that cause doubt one of these episodes is precisely the construction of reficar to which the control body opened a file because the project was contemplated at us   million and ended up costing us   million in addition the refinery had to be inaugurated in  and started operations until november  after a special action at bioenergy the fuel ethanol plant owned by ecopetrol the comptrollers office concluded that the project is inefficient and ineffective as it was not carried out in the time originally planned but more than doubled in addition it presented cost overruns since us   million had been allocated for its construction and it ended up costing us   million on another occasion the comptrollers office alerted about irregularities in contracts made between ecopetrol and the agrogascada company then owned by pacific rubiales according to the entity the colombian oil company caused detriments amounting to   million due to improper use by third parties since it irregularly authorized investments in fields in the exploration stage the contrasts andres felipe quiroga corporate lawyer these cases raise a corruption alarm and should be investigated in depth since the managers could come causing fiscal damage to the state german nova professor and researcher at the national university they are tricks to make up the financial statements and distort that it has been a bad investment if depreciation is slower profit increases  last year when ecopetrol had the intention of selling propilco the comptrollers office released a study in which it warned that the value of propilco was higher than the sale value for this reason the government desisted from alienating it finally the most recent case to be known was that a report from the control body two years ago would have warned that the oil company would not have complied with the rules to abandon wells and it became known after what was the environmental disaster in santander precisely in relation to that case the oil company reported that this week the lizama  well would be sealed since the snubbing unit a machine brought to the area for the task would be coming into operation in the next few days after on saturday the emergency drills were taking placeecopetrols share grows thanks to a brent price at  levels the outlook for the oil world looks stable at least for the remainder of  according to some of the movements around international politics and relaxation in world trade which could keep it above us   per barrel or even climb the price to us   if saudi arabias intentions materialize a barrel of brent was traded again at  levels with a unit price of us   a value that had not been seen since december   when it was priced at us   an effect that is felt in the state oil company ecopetrol so far this year the species of the oil company on the colombian stock exchange bvc has recovered  if one takes into account that on the first trading day of the year january  the title of the oil company had a closing price of   in contrast to a closing price of   per share that it reached in tuesdays session financial market analysts believe that the oil company quickly adapted to the changes and managed to absorb the increase in the behavior of oil since before it began to hit highs again according to juan camilo dauder credicorps equity research manager indicated that ecopetrol has gone ahead and discounted the oil rises although if the current north sea crude prices are maintained it may lead to the action continuing going up  being clear that there is some euphoria in the rise of oil and that it would stabilize at around us   per barrel however the oil company has the challenge of maintaining efficiencies to cover its operating costs with which an eventual increase in crude could be further exploited in accordance with the intentions of saudi arabia explained daniel lombana fixed income analyst at equities and securities  in this sense the company has done well its task of achieving savings and efficiencies which total   billion between  and  as indicated by its president felipe bayon at the shareholders meeting a few weeks ago and lombana believes that  if operations costs are covered the price of a barrel does not have to affect  despite the boost given to ecopetrol by the growth of crude oil the same is not the case with canacol energy the other oil company in the bvc so far in  the canadian stock had a  contraction with a closing price of   for camilo thomas equity analyst at alianza valores although this species also takes into account the international behavior of crude oil it is driven by other causes such as lower tensions and greater risk capacity a fact that is repeated in other actions within del colcap which has barely had a growth of  so far in  in the bvc now it should not be overlooked that although the increase in the price of crude oil has had a positive impact on ecopetrol other companies that have some degree of dependence on the hydrocarbon industry such as avianca would not benefit if one takes into account for example that as of march  it barely grew  although the company has the purchase of fuel covered according to lombana it plays against oil as it is a very important input the impact should not be total one by one but we do expect the stock and the company to show lower margins oil at us   boosts ecopetrol action which rises  and is close to   related article ecopetrols share grows thanks to a brent price at  levels ecopetrols share on the colombian stock exchange continues to have an upward trend due to the boost given by the increase in oil prices only in the day has risen  reaching a price of   at  am oil for its part gains more than  touching its highest levels since the end of  as revealed by reuters crude oil it began to show an increase after the president of the united states donald trump threatened a missile attack on syria thus the brent benchmark reached a maximum of almost us   while crude oil futures in the united states wti rose  cents since its last close at us   a barrel geopolitical concerns overtook global crude inventories as the main driver of the markets and a bearish inventory report was quickly overshadowed after the intercepted rockets over riyadh became known adding to the recent rise in geopolitical tensions he said anthony headrick an analyst at chs hedging llc told reutersoil companies social investment is   trillion since  the hydrocarbon sector has enormous importance in social management if the use of environmental and public resources required for its operation is taken into account in  alone the national environmental licensing authority anla registered a total of  applications for environmental licenses for the industry which comes hand in hand with social investments in the areas where they have influence among the most relevant issues in the social management of oil and gas companies are investments in productive development education community strengthening and road infrastructure in accordance with the contributions made by companies that have operations in the country  in addition to those related to environmental issues when reviewing the investments in the sector in recent years the figures are remarkable between  and  companies in the hydrocarbon sector made investments of   trillion for the development of the sectors mentioned above in addition to seeking institutional strengthening in the regions according to figures from the colombian petroleum association acp which collected information on the social management of  hydrocarbon exploration production and transport companies which represent  of the industry in the same period a total of   billion for the construction of the rehabilitation of the tertiary road network in municipalities the contrasts francisco lloreda president of the acp president of the acp felipe bayon president of ecopetrol we made environmental investments in the different areas of operation for more than   million an increase of  only  the year of the last report available by companies had remarkable figures in social matters for the industry the social investment of the  companies totaled   million despite the adjustment of the sector due to the fall in oil prices and which today is already around us   per barrel again according to the acp  of that amount   million were voluntary investments by the companies this amount was received by  departments in which oil activity is carried out for roads the investment totaled   million although only  was allocated for new roads among other achievements such as the generation of  jobs of this total  is qualified labor while the other  which is not qualified is national hiring social and institutional strengthening is another of the key areas of the oil sector in terms of investment and social responsibility this is the case of conocophillips which together with the popular university of cesar developed at the beginning of this year a diploma for institutional strengthening for authorities and community leaders in the municipality of san martin the companys area of influence environmental component in addition to social work an important part of the industrys reinvestments is directed to the environmental sector and in particular to the use of water resources felipe bayon president of ecopetrol assured that the social investment of the state company was more than   million and was focused on supporting the construction of public infrastructure of community interest projects to reduce gaps in education and health culture and projects for the conservation of water resources  in particular   million were invested in environmental issues that is a growth of  compared to the amount invested in  likewise he highlighted that the company achieved the reuse of  million cubic meters of water equivalent to  of the water total required to operate  facts that stand out despite the problem of crude leaks from la lizama in santander which the company had to face with implications on the flora and fauna of the area and in which it continues to carry out recovery work  for example  of the species another great player in the sector is canacol energy which also developed plans for environmental management with investments that as of  totaled   million and that were directed to operations associated with the management of water discharges emissions and management of waste and also in preventive tasks in addition to work with the communities lloreda considered that despite this panorama the manifestations of rejection of the presence of the industry have expanded even in regions where there is no oil activity since there is little information on the positive impacts therefore which highlighted the importance of this industry to reach out to the communitieswith an oil price of us   ecopetrols share rises in more than three years the oil market did not have as good news as the maximum level reached yesterday after saudi arabia announced the interception of missiles over riyadh and the warning of us president donald trump of a military action in syria with these shares the brent benchmark rose us    reaching us   per barrel for its part the wti rose us    to us   per barrel after trading at us   these increases in addition to benefiting the price of the colombian peso against the dollar caused ecopetrols share to have an important behavior during the day on the colombian stock exchange bvc since at  am due to the increase of crude oil prices the stock rose  and was close to   geopolitical concerns overtook global crude inventories as the main driver of the markets and a bearish inventory report was quickly overshadowed after the intercepted rockets over riyadh became known adding to the recent rise in geopolitical tensions anthony headrick an analyst at chs hedging llc told reuters as it has been presenting for several weeks ecopetrols share continues to perform well and at the close of the day it was the one that presented the greatest increases appreciating  with a price per share of   this value also drove it to be one of the most traded with    million in transactions since several investors who bought three years ago were waiting for this price level to be able to sell and earn on their investments related article with integration with deceval bvc income reached   million finally in the list of the most valued shares of the bvc it was followed by the preferred title of davivienda that had a closing price of   a growth of   and   million

asofondos congress the president of the colombian stock exchange juan pablo cordoba said that a viable option to improve the fiscal deficit of the national government which is largely generated by the pension gap is the sale of another  of ecopetrol the proposal cordoba pointed out would not be focused solely on this sale he also pointed out other government assets could be analyzed to help give space in the fiscal deficit while the rules to be taken within a new pension reform are defined it should be noted that the national government owns almost  of the company and is authorized by the congress of the republic to sell another percentage to  there is a space to sell part of the company the proposal is that for this new fiscal path there is room for a conversation about asset and liability management that would incorporate the sale of some of the nations shares it could be ecopetrol or other investments made by the company nation he explained according to cordoba the operation would help reduce debt give additional resources to the government and have more manageable margins from the fiscal point of viewecopetrol activated a contingency plan for an attack on the narino

the price of crude oil in  more than  attacks were committed against the oil pipelines in the country according to ecopetrol from  to date more than  million barrels of crude oil have been spilled on account of these terrorist attacksthe milestones of  years of oil extraction in colombia on april  it will be  years since the first discoveries of crude oil were recorded in the la cira  infantas field near barrancabermeja with reserves of  million barrels tomorrow lr organizes a forum in bogota to commemorate this centenary at that time after several transfers the field was operated by the tropical oil company troco whose shares belonged to standard oil of new jersey however in  this concession reverted to the state to be managed by the oil company that the government created in  empresa colombia de petroleos today ecopetrol which has had this field for more than  years for jorge bendeck president of the national federation of biofuels of colombia fedebiocombustibles the creation of ecopetrol was one of the most important events for the development of the oil sector in the country its creation was an extraordinary leap towards the nationalization of extraction in addition the leadership in exploration refining and transportation made the country a relatively developed one in the oil field he said despite its age the la cira  infantas field continues to extract oil and according to francisco jose lloreda president of the colombian petroleum association acp its production has increased it is important to mention that before the discoveries in this field in  in the government of rafael reyes the first oil regulations began to be drawn up likewise in  decree  was promulgated which allowed the granting of oil concessions thus that year diego martinez signed a concession contract to build a refining plant in cartagena general virgilio barco signed the tibu concession for exploration and extraction and roberto de mares signed the concession for exploration and exploitation in barrancabermeja under this last concession the us company troco discovered the infantas  and la cira well which was discovered six years later in  according to ecopetrol data la cira  infantas reached the highest level of production in  when it reached to  barrels per day with  active producing wells however in  the fields production fell to  barrels per day in  the new barrancabermeja refinery plants were inaugurated with a loading capacity of  barrels per day it became directly managed by ecopetrol in  the refinery became an industrial complex that increased oil development he even directed it to petrochemicals and more elaborate production bendeck said the contrasts jorge bendeck president of fedebiocombustibles thanks to new technologies and the invention of patents the recovery factor went from  to a range of  to  julio cesar vera president of acipet the sector has contributed in tax revenues royalties and jobs it has also caused social development and could do so for  more years  in  the government enacted law  in which state ownership of the subsoil was reiterated later in  the country became an oil importer which affected the nations finances for this reason the following year the association contract was created a basic way of exploring and producing oil in the country that same year several companies expressed their interest in partnering with ecopetrol in addition the state oil company expanded by acquiring the shell condor fields and the cartagena refinery in  the cano  limon field was discovered with more than  million barrels of reserves this finding allowed the country to regain its oil selfsufficiency then in  the cano limon  covenas pipeline was inaugurated which spanned  kilometers and made it possible to export crude from the field to international markets in  the national hydrocarbons agency anh was created in order to administer hydrocarbons the subscription and administration of exploration and exploitation contracts in the national territory in this way ecopetrol became a joint stock company linked to minminas after obtaining the respective approvals ecopetrol entered the new york stock exchange in  for julio cesar vera president of acipet the oil sector has been a fundamental pillar for the economic and social development of the country and has a commitment to be getting better and applying the best technical standards for his part bendeck believes that the sector should continue exploring and developing technology to increase the recovery factor since the conquest there was evidence of oil in the country the history of oil in the country does not begin with the la cira  infantas field but goes back to the time of the conquest with the arrival of the expedition of gonzalo jimenez de quesada to la tora today barrancabermeja at that time the yarigui indians used oil as a body comforter and the spaniards to waterproof their boats likewise it is known that in  jorge isaacs the author of maria acquired an oil concession in urabathe effects of the revaluation of the colombian peso on the national accounts the continued rise in international oil prices added to the political tension between russia and the united states and between the latter and china over a possible trade war has led the colombian peso to gain ground on the us currency in recent weeks so far this year the colombian currency has revalued  falling from   the price at which it was traded in the first days of january to   yesterday if this scenario of revaluation of the local currency continues experts agree that public finances could benefit from some factors such as lower interest payments on foreign debt taxes from exporters that would tend to be reduced and higher tariffs for part of imports debt reduction in the first place the revaluation of the colombian peso makes the external debt denominated in dollars much easier to pay because when the dollar is devalued the government must deliver less pesos for each us currency to pay off a previously acquired obligation with foreign entities when the exchange rate falls the value in colombian pesos of the external debt is reduced which is positive for public finances because less pressure is generated on the states pocket as far as possible it would be good to take advantage of it to pay the debt faster since we would save a good amount of interest as a country this is subject to the conditions of the entities that have lent us such as the international monetary fund imf or the world bank among others  explained alejandro useche professor of economics at the universidad del rosario for example while the value in pesos of the foreign debt was   trillion on december  with a dollar at   if we take into account yesterdays trm the balance reached   trillion that is in only four months fell  in addition the external debt would also decrease its percentage with respect to gdp because now the value of the proportion of goods and services of the local economy in dollars will be higher that is if in december it represented  of gdp  public and  private now it will mean less compared to the total economy since with a dollar at   the size of the national accounts in dollars increased to  compared to december the contrasts alejandro useche professor of economics at the universidad del rosario the government is favored by the lower cost of debt but at the same time it does not receive the same income from exports sergio olarte macroeconomic analyst at btg pactual an average revaluation of the colombian peso will lower the price of the external debt that the state has with foreign entities if the gdp in dollars is higher due to the appreciation then now my pesos cost more and therefore the external debt as a proportion of gdp will be less this is positive because it is easier for them to lend us from abroad said sergio olarte macroeconomic analyst at btg pactual according to the banco de la republica colombias external debt balance was us   million as of december  which represented an increase of us   million compared to what was registered in the same period of the previous year in percentage terms last year the balance represented grew  more than in  lower income on the other hand with the fall in the price of the us currency the revenues received by the state in us currency such as for example linked to oil exports they are reduced however these would tend to be offset by the rise in international crude prices since a barrel of brent oil for delivery in june is already priced at us   which benefits tax revenues if we multiply each barrel of oil of the around  that we export for a cheaper dollar the income we receive is reduced however what you have to pay for taxes will also be less you have to think about what weighs the most for the state if the lower payment of interest on the foreign debt or the lower taxes that the oil companies will have to pay due to the appreciation of the peso olarte said higher collection due to tariffs although the import data for the second month of the year only grew  compared to the same period of  totaling the figure of us   million experts such as camilo andres duran research analyst at credicorp capital indicated that it was a good figure because in february there was an outstanding behavior in the acquisition of capital goods for the industry with a growth of  compared to the same month of  with a dollar down this situation it could improve even more as the appreciation of the peso would also help importers this would be the third factor to take into account when having a generalized scenario of dollar weakness since buyers are more willing to buy at a lower price also imported local goods are more affordable for consumers with a cheap dollar more is imported and that generates a higher collection for the state for the payment of tariffs explained olarte how can consumers benefit according to experts surveyed by lr the regression that the us currency has experienced in recent months also opens a good opportunity for those who need to buy dollars if they are going to travel abroad soon or if they need to pay their debts denominated in dollars or any kind of commitments bvc companies that earn with a low dollar if we only serve companies that are in the capitalization index of the colombian stock exchange bvc the revaluation of the colombian peso could benefit certain companies that report their financial results in the us currency those that are indebted in the us currency or those that present a cost structure with a greater weight of the greenback for example that would be the case of avianca cemex latam holdings grupo exito grupo energia bogota or ecopetrol

from the government we believe that it will be around us   he said likewise the minister said that this years budget was made on the basis that the price of crude oil will be us   therefore the news that the price is higher than budgeted will give the state more resources for next year at the moment we are having higher income from exports which reduces our fiscal deficit the exchange rate is also being felt which is below   cardenas mentioned according to anh calculations production would tend to increase on average for this year to  barrels while for next year the average could be above  barrels on the other hand the minister recalled that during the years of low prices unpopular but necessary measures were taken such as the sale of isagen with the sale of which part of the works belonging to the  program were financed regarding the conclusions cardenas pointed out that the increase in oil prices has implied a greater increase in resources which makes it possible that this years growth is contemplated at ecopetrol will invest between us   and us   million in  for new exploration projects related article ecopetrol and the country adapted to living with low oil prices cardenas in the framework of the lr forum  years of oil the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon pardo highlighted the economic and social contribution that the oil in the last century and clarified that for this year the company will invest between us   and us   million for production and development projects bayon clarified that this industry will continue to play a fundamental role in the development of the country it is a sector that has contributed a lot to the country but it still has a lot to give it has been said that we are not an oil country but indeed oil has been a factor that drives colombias finances  in fact he indicated that for a little more than  years the la cirainfantas well has managed to produce about  million barrels which has allowed this area to become a protagonist of the countrys oil development in the last decade ecopetrol has delivered  billion to the country which is not only evident in the regional accounts but also in the quality of life of the communities and areas of interest clarified bayon among the milestones he highlighted about the  years of oil bayon explained that a very important event was when in  colombians were allowed to own ecopetrol today we are a business group with a presence in four countries on the continent and we are among the  companies worldwide  he also added to this by saying that for example with the cartagena refinery  barrels could normally be extracted and today ecopetrol reaches  barrels that is more than its normal production bayon clarified likewise he concluded by saying that at this moment the company is very interested in the gas market in the countryin the last  years colombia has found opportunities for economic development in oil in the first panel of the lr forum history of oil in colombia the history of the sector in the country was discussed and the main milestones that have occurred during the last decade were highlighted related article ecopetrol will invest between us   and us   million in  for new exploration projects first miguel angel santiago reyes manager of the petroleum museum spoke about how the industry has developed in recent years in his speech he stressed that in the first  years colombia found in oil the opportunity for economic and social development of the country after the  and with the creation of the colombian petroleum company formerly ecopetrols name there was a stage in history the increase in production came and the beginning of colombian reserves  he clarified this was also added by pedro alcides rizo vergel academic advisor at the universidad d america who highlighted that these  years are divided into four cycles first the time of reversion of seas from  to  and second the consolidation of the ecopetrol operations where there are no major discoveries due to a drop in colombian reserves which was from  to  after this time we were coming from difficult times until  when the country found canolimon after that period the sector growth began and it was until  the fourth stage that the national hydrocarbons agency was created  alcids also highlighted the development of technical personnel in the sector as he clarified that although until  the managers were only foreigners it was until the second half of the  century that the first universities in the country were seen in fact in  the petroleum engineering program was created at the university of america amylkar acosta former minister of mines and energy for his part did not speak about the story and referred to the popular consultations when indicating that they are affecting all the production of the companies however he emphasized that the problem is centered on social conflict where the extractive activity of the oil companies is taking place the lack of a territorial order in colombia does not exist so it must be ruled out that these problems are due to the legal gaps that still do not exist in the country  faced with this issue julian santos rubino partner at holland  knight indicated that it is time to create a restructuring in the sector where there are new ecosystems that do not affect the communities for me the issue of prior consultations is linked to the benefits that communities receive from the productions it is time to bring these interest groups to a lower leveloil workers warn that communication with communities must be improved related article in the last  years colombia found opportunities for economic development in oil oil companies must have better communication with their communities so that the bad image of the sector ends that was one of the conclusions of the second panel of the lr forum  years of oil where they spoke about the current scenario in which companies move and what is coming in terms of production maria victoria riano salgar president of equion energia clarified that after going through several cycles in the sector the most important thing is to keep your sanity because prices are not everything we definitely learned the lesson and we have to work better for the regions and their communities that is where the key is  he clarified added to this was riccardo nicoletti tipiels general manager who beyond talking about what happened stressed that it is time to prepare for better scenarios but with the people several challenges are coming in the industry however these must include the development of the communities  although the two stressed that the important thing is to focus on the communities adrian coral president of gran tierra energy stressed that it is important to analyze access to the new reserves colombia continues to be an attractive country for investment in fact according to minister cardenas  of foreign investment is what drives this sector that is why we have to work together to not only have a dialogue with the communities but also to define a state policy to access the new reserves faced with how these challenges should be faced the invited panelists highlighted that it is necessary to create agreements with the communities and show the social work that companies carry out this because according to riano salgar the perception of the industry is little controlled despite the fact that royalties are paid and invested in the communities the procedures are quite regulated and we could communicate that aspect better i think that we have not communicated this well around the industry therefore we have to learn and develop longterm policies highlighted riano salgar fracking was also added to this discussion despite the fact that the businessmen warned that it is an issue that should not be set from the political sphere they warned that it is necessary for this debate to focus on the technical specifications and the benefits that are given through this modelso far this year five shares have appreciated more than colcap despite the volatility of the markets at a global level which was felt more strongly in the first two months of the year when the index that measures this factor vix rose  five shares of the colombian stock exchange have grown more than the main indicator colcap and they managed to mitigate the fall that they have presented so far in the year  of the  titles that are traded on the stock market the one that has grown the most in its price is ecopetrol which went from having a value of

that the success of the oil company is directly related to the improvement in oil prices so we have to see if this trend will continue and if it is sustainable now investors have also valued that compared to  the firm is more profitable in the operational part  regarding the good moment of colcap the analysts explained that it will continue as long as the good performance of the banking sector stocks bancolombia and davivienda and ecopetrol continues since they represent about  of the index we saw that the market value is especially concentrated in bancolombia and ecopetrol in an exercise we did when the colcap appreciated  we noticed that these two shares had done so  while the rest of the securities had fallen  there we could see how these titles counteracted the total weight added baquero the contrasts erika baquero stock analyst at alianza valores on colcaps projections we expect  units and the behavior of oil prices to follow now according to wilson tovar head of research for shares and securities in the indices you always see this type of behavior so you should not overweight the role of stocks and added to ecopetrol that in addition to the value of oil last year when they reactivated the capex before other companies did the oil company became visible and managed to capture the interest of foreigners who see the opportunity to invest in the action thus we expect a price between   and   for the end of the month  regarding the behavior of bancolombia analysts expect a recovery for the financial sector and the entity is one of the big bets so they believe that the title will continue to test its levels analysts also explained that a factor that is prevailing in these actions is their liquidity they lead because they are the most liquid and their relevance in the north american market weighs this makes them more striking added baquero finally on the expectations of the recovery for the construction sector which has the shares that have lost the most in the year it is expected that it will occur but in a slower way and not as pronounced as expected for  closing market and expectations in line with the  drop in the price of oil on the day which closed in the london market at us   the colcap also fell from  to   however etb shares performed well which rose  mineros  and grupo argos  regarding the projections that the colcap will touch  points in the short term tovar explained that this is due to the fact that colombia in the last three years remained quiet while the stock markets in the region rose so today the market sees that there are assets with value and that they are cheap the  years of oil in colombia april  will mark the first century since the first oil discoveries were made in the la cira  infantas field near barrancabermeja which is still fully exploited the oil field was operated under concession by standard oils tropical oil company in  it was reverted to the state and began to be managed by empresa colombia de petroleos today ecopetrol a brief beginning for a great business history that has shaped the economic development of colombia from that moment the country found the oil that served to transform an agrarian economy into an industrial one that would have its greatest acceleration in the eighties when they found crude in cano limon and later in the nineties with cusiana and cupiaga but it has been a bittersweet transformation because the history of oil in colombia has also been marked by corruption violence workers confrontations but above all by the lack of strategy for many years the oil bonanzas have not been felt beyond the minimal regional transformations that can only be reflected in the passage of some country roads to paved roads there are not many great works that can be shown to the world as a result of the oil wealth only the pipelines and the two refineries are saved all of them not clean works of great acts of corruption but the one who can most celebrate the century of oil in colombia is the government in any of those that have passed in  years because thanks to the resources that oil has left the different administrations have been able to finance since ecopetrol transfers to state coffers have risen to   billion in the last decade and it is a sector that represents about  of gdp according to minister mauricio cardenas but by far it is a wealth that cannot be replaced with other products even being the absolute kings of banana coffee pineapples and avocado exports it would not achieve  of the gdp that is exported annually in oil this year looks very good for the oil sector because prices continue to rise and local production follows the trend last year ecopetrols average daily barrels reached  and this year it may reach  this has been reflected in the behavior of the share of the joint venture that has risen  in its price in the year exceeding   a reasonable price since on january  it was at   in september of last year the price of the title had only reached   so the rebound in just six months has been almost   this information from the colombian stock market is important because ecopetrols role is not only the backbone for the colombian secondary market but it affects the interests of almost half a million colombians it goes without saying that despite all the stormy winds that have always blown over ecopetrol these fat cows that are coming take over the joint venture strengthened thanks to the modernization process that is being carried out todays ecopetrol is much more efficient and is determined to build another century of good history but there will always be internal processes and trends that must be handled with caution as this happens in almost all companies in the worldthe price of a barrel of oil above us   requires prudence this week april  marks the  anniversary of the infantas  well the first in the country to commemorate this event which comes at a time of relatively good oil prices lr organized the  years of oil forum in which the message given by the speakers is that this situation of a barrel above us   merits prudence in his presentation the minister of finance mauricio cardenas highlighted that apparently the price crisis that affected the countrys economy since  would already be overcome and recalled the impacts that this reduction in prices had on the industry at the beginning of  we managed to have oil below us   and it was the first time that i heard from the ecopetrol board that we had to close fields said the minister this drop in prices not only reduced the sectors income but also influenced production to decline however cardenas affirmed that both ecopetrol and the country adapted to the new reality of low prices and in  ecopetrol obtained a net profit of   trillion a figure similar to that of the years of high oil prices despite the drop in prices and the fact that colombia is not an oil country according to german arce minister of mines and energy in recent years the energy mining sector contributed  of the gross domestic product gdp and contributed close to   trillion to public finances according to arces accounts the sector was so important to the national finances that at the best of times one out of every four pesos collected came from oil companies at present the outlook is different and more encouraging as the prices of a barrel of oil are above us   us   above the price used by the ministry of finance to calculate the budget for this year this higher price will benefit the next government because it will have revenues that we were not expecting said cardenas who added that the immediate impact of the price hike has been seen in higher revenues in exports which lower the trade deficit and exchange rate however the minister stressed that having higher prices requires prudence since other sectors cannot be neglected or allow the economy to depend solely on oil the contrasts german arce minister of mines and energy we have been working on developing this action strategy to work with the communities it goes beyond the periods of government  mauricio cardenas minister of finance in  we managed to have oil below us   it was the first time that i heard from the ecopetrol board that we had to close fields on the other hand the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon announced that ecopetrol will invest between us   and us   million this year most of these resources will be destined to the search for new reserves ecopetrol emerged from the crisis strengthened and has the financial muscle to embark on a new phase of growth he said bayon also highlighted that ecopetrol is going to bet on a greater share in the gas and bioenergy market in the midst of the energy transition but asserted that this industry will continue to be absolutely relevant for the country finally bayon said that they will be respectful of the consultations but emphasized that the communities must be very well informed not only of the risks but also of the benefits before making a determination high employment rate in oil municipalities according to a study carried out by fedesarrollo and presented by astrid martinez associate researcher of that entity between  and  the formal employment rate in oil municipalities was  times higher than that of nonoil municipalities of meta and  times higher than the average of the countrys municipalities this study also shows that in recent years socioeconomic indicators in oil regions have improved more than the national average especially in departments where production has grownimpact of crude leaks in la lizama would take a year to recover un the united nations un released its report on the impact on the environment in relation to the leaks of milk gas and mud in well  where since last march  crude oil began to come out the un environment delegate dan stothart indicated that what happened is visually very shocking but it seems to us that it is a mediumsized event and it seems that it is a recovery process that can take place in perhaps a year or so  likewise the official stressed that a great job has been done in recovery and work with wildlife although various figures such as the number of dead fish are scary we have seen that it is an area of great biodiversity and as a proportion of the impact on fauna in the area it can be recovered  regarding the attention given to him by ecopetrol stothart indicated that there was a complete response there was medical attention by authorities and ecopetrol there were markets and job creation with the community participating in cleaning works at the end the un official indicated that it is difficult to say that it really could have been done much earlier although it is known from documents from the comptrollers office and even from the oil company itself of the existence of risk in some wells of this field for at least two years the audit carried out by the comptroller general of the republic cgr on the status of ecopetrol in  during the presidency of juan carlos echeverry revealed a finding according to which ecopetrol did not physically abandon the wells of the  exploitation program which he made before the national hydrocarbons agency anh despite the fact that the regulations on the matter indicate that they should be plugged and dismantled immediately although it is not about well  which caused the environmental difficulties that the companys environmental work is currently targeting the report which was published in  indicated that the abandonment plan for well  was not indicated of this field a fact that denotes flaws in the planning and management of well abandonment an essential activity for environmental conservationdollar reached a price of   and closed the day with a rise of   yesterday the dollar continued to climb and is already   above the minimum value of the year of   in which it was traded two weeks ago this situation had been anticipated by analysts when they pointed out that a dollar below   was considered cheap for those interested in making purchases abroad or paying debts in this currency only yesterday the currency reached an average price of   which represented an increase of   compared to the representative market rate trm which stood at   the escalation took place during the day as the currency opened the session with a price of   and reached a maximum of   according to german cristancho head of investigations at davivienda corredores this recovery was generated mainly by the behavior of the us  treasury bonds which were traded yesterday and held above  this has made the profitability differentials between the united states and emerging markets narrow a lot which generates a strengthening of the dollar  in this way throughout the region currencies operated at levels not seen since the second half of last january and the dollar index prepared by bloomberg gained  now on the projections cristancho pointed out that initially it is difficult for the dollar to go above   in the local market in these weeks due to the concentration that has occurred in the negotiations at these levels and clarified that the issue to monitor will be the flow of investments from foreigners in the colombian tes market today it is more complicated for the flow in fixed income or the dollar to increase since the flows that have entered have been focused especially on tes and today they have little room for appreciation so if you see increases we hope they will be for the second semester  he concluded ecopetrol continues to be the most traded at the close of the colombian stock exchange bvc despite the  drop in ecopetrols share price to   the title of the oil company continues to be the most traded with   million in the session the titles that had the best performance were those of corficolombiana with a rise of  isa  and the preferential of grupo sura daviviendas  valuation also stood out which yesterday obtained approval to capitalize its subsidiary in panama for up to us   millioninstrument of progress a couple of years ago a major technology company and academics at the university of westminster charted their vision of the world in the next century the image presented seemed worthy of a futuristic hollywood movie giant buildings and some subways cities wrapped in bubbles under the sea and the domain of artificial intelligence would be part of the daily life of  according to this prediction it is easy to make mistakes when it comes to longterm projections but what would seem inevitable is that in the coming decades the world population will continue to grow  unless humanity becomes aware of the environmental impact of population growth  and with it the demand for services food and of course energy that is why thinking about the future also implies thinking about how the needs of an increasingly numerous humanity and with high expectations of quality of life will be met between figures and balances experts from the international energy agency and columbia university among many other prestigious research centers show that in the coming decades  years renewable energies will have a greater growth but that fossil fuels will continue to be one of the main sources of energy especially natural gas and to a lesser extent oil the above due to the fact that the demand base from which renewable sources start is low and it is difficult to abruptly replace hydrocarbons as energy sources due to their calorific power their relative ease of transportation and because of their price compared to other sources it is still competitive even those countries like france that talk about banning the sale of vehicles that run on gasoline and diesel set these goals for  or  years colombia is a privileged country in energy sources starting with hydraulics it also has important deposits of oil and gas in the subsoil and favorable solar and wind conditions in some regions to meet internal demand and be a major exporter it has also been a privileged country because in the last hundred years it has had an industry that has leveraged its development from the moment oil was discovered in the la cirainfantas field in santander in april  since then and later with the construction of the barrancabermeja refinery the future of the country was divided into a before and after the country was able to selfsupply itself with fuels and petroleum derivatives and important industries such as automotive and aviation took off and important road port and airport infrastructure projects were built marking out other sectors of the economy and interconnecting the country in addition to the above the industry became one of the main contributors in  to cite an example  oil companies contributed  of the income tax the next   companies from different sectors and the remaining  a little more than  colombians this without counting the contributions of the sector in royalties economic rights and dividends from ecopetrol not surprisingly despite the fact that industry represents  of gdp it became a fundamental instrument for the development of the country and its regions thus in the last decade with royalty resources from the extractive sector the country has been able to build or improve  kilometers of roads built and equipped  educational institutions  health entities benefiting the quality of life of colombians especially of those who live in more remote territories it has helped  colombians lift themselves out of extreme poverty and  more lift them out of poverty this without counting the hundreds of hectares reforested and incorporated into conservation programs in which the oil industry invests through the  forced investment and environmental compensation programs as part of its obligations within the environmental licenses and to programs of voluntary investment estimated at col   billion in other words in addition to the income it generates for the state it is an industry committed to social and environmental matters this has been demonstrated in the last hundred years it is difficult to know what the main source of energy will be in  years fossil fuels hydroelectric wind and solar may not be the advances of science and technology every day shield us what is foreseeable is that in the coming decades the world will move towards a diversification of its energy sources a phenomenon that will occur at different rates in each region of the world and in this process oil and especially natural gas will be present providing reliability to the electrical system helping the economy move and the inhabitants of the planet have quality of life colombia must not be absent it is their duty in the coming decades to develop their subsoil resources in a responsible way to make them an instrument of progress it would be incomprehensible not to do it to leave them buried with so many needs the oil industry celebrates its first one hundred years serving colombia and is in a position to continue doing so and help millions of colombians to have a better quality of lifefabricato was the most valued share during the day of the colombian stock exchange related article after several days of rising the colcap index fell  and closed at  points during yesterdays session on the colombian stock exchange the colcap index showed a negative variation of  and ended the day with  units driven in part by the fall in ecopetrols share price which closed at   with a negative variation of  and a volume traded of   million these papers from the colombian oil company were followed with the same behavior by the setbacks in the share of the enka textile factory with a fall of  to   the preferred securities of the investment holding corficolombiana with a decrease of  to   and the gold producer mineros with a decrease of  to   on the other hand the securities that appreciated the most were those of fabricato with an increase of  at a closing price of   and a trading volume of   million the textile company was followed by the preferred share of grupo de inversiones suramericana with a variation of  and a closing of   and finally the share of the financial entity bancolombia was located with a variation of  the falls were softened by the endofday rise in oil prices supported by expectations of new us sanctions against iranthe life of oil reserves is more than  million barrels for  years the fall in the international price of crude oil for two years in a row caused an oil crisis however as for ecopetrol which has  of the reserves in the country last year was positive and closed with the increase in its reserves to  million barrels of crude related article the price of a barrel of oil above us   requires prudence although the threat of a shortage of crude seemed imminent in  the hydrocarbon industry had a slight recovery and a barrel of oil reached us   while it is currently close to us   undoubtedly this relief favored crude oil production according to the national hydrocarbons agency anh and the amount of reserves it is important to highlight that a large part of the increase in proven reserves is due to the results of the program to increase the recovery factor whose main achievements have been in fields such as chichimene castilla casabe and tibu the oil company reported the reserve replacement rate was  undoubtedly the highest in the last three years thanks to this trend for each barrel produced ecopetrol added  barrels in proven reserves a result that favors the economy today the oil company has an average reserve life of  years this increase in oil reserves in colombia is due to various factors besides the price that favors the incorporation and purchase also the innovation that makes the extraction processes more efficient and the new explorations carried out inside and outside the national territory in the case of the largest company in colombia one of its pillars is the program to increase the recovery factor and the continuous development of exploration fields and the execution of unconventional projects it is estimated that of the barrels of oil produced by the company in  around  million are due to technical work and financial optimization of its assets reserves were estimated based on the standards and methodology of the united states securities and exchange commission sec regarding the sec price used for the valuation of the reserves in  this was us   per barrel of brent compared to us   per barrel of brent in  according to ecopetrol as a result of a higher price they recovered approximately  million barrels of crude oil equivalent thanks to the extension of the economic limit of the fields and the incorporation of new projects for carlos benavides vice president of corporate affairs and business at mansarovar energy this trend is also on the rise as some very dynamic years are expected for the hydrocarbon industry in colombia taking into account the upward trend in the international price of crude oil and the interest that exists on the part of the government to encourage hydrocarbon exploration and improved recovery projects which leads to the addition and replacement of reserves in a way that is friendly to the environment and society in terms of resources colombia is a country with high prospectivity that generates interest to both national and foreign companies the geological potential the new improved recovery technologies that have been implemented in the country and that the good investment environment is maintained in the sector the industry has more future than past in colombia  benavides highlighted in this sense in  mansarovar energy plans an initial investment of close to us   million in order to ensure volumes with value for its shareholders with a replacement of reserves leveraged by improved recovery technologies such as steam injection gels and foams on the other hand about us   million will be invested in the operation of its fields in production ensuring sustainable development through proven operational excellence for its part the anh has considered that for the year to end with an increase in reserves it is vital that it focus on improving its recovery factor which is between  and  if achieved the increase would be at least  million barrels of oil this year oil investment is expected to be approximately us   billion based on a stable price the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol most of the resources for this year will be destined to the search for new reserves julio cesar vera president of acipet the fundamental thing in new reservations is to have more certainty in relation to legal security carlos benavides vice president of corporate affairs and business at mansarovar energy the creation of incentives for investors security and clear and sustainable regulations in the sector are decisive especially in the face of the situation that is experienced with the legal insecurity of popular consultations  offshore exploration is one of the most important one of the activities that is generating increasing interest to ensure the expansion of oil reserves is offshore exploration and exploitation under which other large companies such as shell repsol anadarko and exxon mobil have shown a growing interest to develop farreaching projectsecopetrol will present its first quarter results next week ecopetrol announced through a statement that the delivery date of its financial results for the first quarter will be next thursday may  after the market closes following this the company is expected to hold two conference calls on friday may  in english and spanish to comment on the results obtained according to analysts expectations the oil company will have positive revenues that will reach about   trillion with an increase of  driven by the improvement in oil prices in the first quarter of this year when the the average price of wti reference crude was us   which means an increase of  compared to the first quarter of  likewise the price of brent reference crude increased and reached us    according to marcela ramirez an analyst at stocks and securities positive results are expected for the oil company in line with a reduction in financial expenses lower leverage and efficiency in the cost optimization program the expectation is that the profit will be close to   trillion with an increase of the companies that will lead in delivering first quarter results in may the calendar for the delivery of financial results for the first quarter of the main companies in the country begins and analysts project that those that will lead with the best numbers will be those of the oil and utilities sector that benefited from better prices for both oil and energy on the stock market related article ecopetrol will present the results of the first quarter next week in this sense and with a rise in the price of brent crude of  compared to the previous quarter and of  compared to the same period of  ecopetrol would take the lead in income actions and values bets because the oil company will have revenues of   billion in the first quarter with an increase of  and a profit of   billion this means a growth of  for marcela ramirez equity analyst at the commission agent these positive numbers are in line with a reduction in financial expenses lower leverage efficiency in the cost optimization program higher levels of oil prices and more exploratory success  regarding this expectation omar suarez casa de bolsas share manager also explained that stable production and greater contributions from the downstream segment are expected in the year mainly due to reficars operational recovery which will continue to have a positive impact on leverage levels  now despite the good oil expectations canacol is expected not to have a significant increase in revenues as gas prices have remained stable in addition the sale of its assets in ecuador will be reflected in a lower oil production so it is expected that revenues will be   million with a fall of  however thanks to the completion of the new gas pipeline profit would improve by  reaching   million according to casa de bolsa for the utilities sector we consider that celsias generation income in the quarter would be favored by the partial entry of plan  caribe projects and an increase in prices on the stock exchange this would be added to a higher expected demand due to the recovery of various productive sectors for the company actions and securities expects an improvement of  in income and  in profits to reach   million the contrasts omar suarez stock manager of casa de bolsa ecopetrol managed to have more efficient costs which has allowed profitability margins to improve and ebitda to recover to almost  a similar projection applies to isa which is expected to maintain its ebitda margin at levels above  with stable income and the continuation of projects in execution maintaining the favorable impact of taesa explained the casa de bag this group also includes grupo energia bogota geb from which an increase in revenues of  to   million is anticipated due to better dynamics in gas transportation and the contributions of the stakes they have in codensa and emgesa finally for the first quarter a neutral performance is expected in the financial sector with better results compared to the fourth quarter since the effects of the reductions in the interest rate begin to be less significant in such a way that the banks have managed to reduce dependence on monetary policy changes explained ramirezin the first quarter of the year ecopetrol generated more than  jobs after the good moment that the oil sector is experiencing due to the increase in international crude prices the state company ecopetrol reported that the first quarter of the year generated  jobs through its contracting companies representing an increase of  jobs additional employment compared to the same period in  in the first quarter of   people worked with exclusive dedication in the works and projects that ecopetrol develops in the country through its contractor companies in the same period of  an average of  people worked which confirms that as the oil activity has been recovering the hiring of personnel has been reactivated in the different regions where the company operates the company indicated according to ecopetrol hiring local labor continues to be one of its priorities since on average  of the jobs were carried out by inhabitants of the regions where the operations are carried out in this sense ecopetrols central regional which includes operations in antioquia bogota bolivar boyaca caldas cesar cundinamarca norte de santander and santander generated the highest number of jobs with an average of  linked workers  of which the majority are concentrated in the department of santander in the orinoquia and oriente regions arauca casanare cundinamarca and meta  jobs were generated where the largest number of contracted workers are found in casanare and meta for its part the southern region caldas caqueta cauca huila putumayo risaralda tolima and valle created an average of  jobs where the largest number of contract personnel was presented in huila and putumayo in the caribbeanpacific region atlantico bolivar cesar choco cordoba guajira magdalena narino sucre and valle the state oil company generated  jobs being the departments of bolivar and sucre where the most personnel were hired finally ecopetrol indicated that in relation to the percentage of local occupations although the national average is  the southern region reported that  of the labor contracts were made locally while in the caribbean pacific region recorded the most attractive stocks to invest in the colombian stock exchange the colcap index of the colombian stock exchange bvc that measures the variations in the prices of the  stocks with the highest market capitalization stood at  units last monday and according to analysts if some titles which are considered attractive to invest they continue their good performance it could reach  points in the next two months among these actions that could have rallies and mark the indicator in the remainder of the first semester and the beginning of the second are the titles of cementos argos by fundamentals in cement companies success because it obtained strong results from brazil where they have their main subsidiary and due to a reactivation of internal consumption and grupo de energia de bogota because they will enter with large projects in this way according to a survey carried out by lr the stock brokers expect that in june at most the index will reach  points now the above would also depend on several factors such as the presidential elections in may if oil prices continue to rise reaching perhaps   the wti since it broke the barrier of us   and the key decisions made by the president donald trump on may  when he decides whether to reinstate the sanctions against iran camilo thomas an analyst at alianza valores points out that in the short term we see by early may that it could be located at  units we must take into account the support of the oil issue that continues to strengthen the market may  is key to knowing what happens with those actions depending on trumps decisions and whether or not the opec agreement continues  additionally the bvc released on monday the report on how the new rebalancing was done which according to the provisions of the commission agents it was expected that ecopetrol would once again be the number one share we expect the index to hit  at the end of may or early june they could be boosted by electoral results but for now it would remain stable we also hope ecopetrol will once again be the one with the most weight said marcela ramirez stock and securities analystecopetrols profits in the first quarter of the year totaled   billion during the first quarter of  ecopetrols profits totaled   trillion which translates into the best quarterly financial result of the last four years in line with the improvements that the companys figures have had regarding production the oil company reported that between january and april it achieved  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped a figure that was affected by public order problems in el meta which affected  barrels of equivalent per day in addition there was a temporary reduction in the water disposal capacity at rubiales which subtracted another  boed although discounting these events it remains at a margin of  bored as evidenced on the last day of march in relation to the companys exploration it was announced that in this period in the exploratory campaign we drilled two wells during the quarter the  well located in the middle magdalena valley basin which is under evaluation while the  well located in the llanos orientales basin was declared successful by the oil company similarly it announced that it achieved an ebitda income before taxes of   billion and an ebitda margin of  these results were achieved even with lower production as a result of a challenging public order environment that affected average production for the quarter the company said felipe bayon president of ecopetrol highlighted the companys achievements in the period such as a solid cash position of   trillion and a gross debt over ebitda indicator of  times which reflects greater efficiency and cost reduction through the transformation plan capital discipline stabilization of the cartagena refinery and better crude oil prices and margins compared to brent during the first quarter of  the volume sold by the group was  barrels of crude oil equivalent that is a  contraction mainly due to the lower availability of crude oil caused by public order problems other data were those of sales abroad  boe were exported which showed a reduction of  while  boe were sold in the local market which fell in the first quarter of  ecopetrol shot up its profits  to reach   billion the best quarter in four years that is the description of the results that ecopetrol presented corresponding to the period between january and march of this year good international oil prices with an average of us   for the benchmark brent crude generated an improvement in the revenues and profits of the state company in total the companys sales amounted to   billion which represented an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year and its net profits totaled   trillion  more than between january and march  furthermore in the letter he sent to shareholders the president of the company felipe bayon highlighted that even with the failures that had in several of their wells both for technical issues and for public order problems in the meta the average production production for the quarter amounted to  barrels of oil equivalent per day with this bayon pointed out that we maintain the production goal for the year in a range between  and  barrels of oil equivalent per day omar suarez equity manager of the brokerage firm casa de bolsa indicated that stable production and greater contributions from the downstream segment to the consolidated were expected mainly due to the operational recovery of reficar which will continue to have a positive impact on the levels of leverage precisely regarding reficars behavior the ecopetrol report indicates that it achieved an average load of  barrels per day during the quarter exceeding the average load of   barrels per day additionally the cartagena refinery had a margin of us   per barrel that is a  increase and with those results said plant was able to make a large contribution to the general accounts in addition it must be added that it has been producing all its capacity even in march it reached over  barrels per day with some days of  the contrasts carlos franco equity strategist at itau comisionista the expectation was positive because international oil prices have been increasing in the last quarter felipe bayon president of ecopetrol we maintain the production goal for the year in a range between  and  barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result of the stable operation of the refinery we have had a  gross margin for seven consecutive months likewise during the quarter the refinery used  of national crude in its crude diet demonstrating the consolidation of the optimization process of the crude oil diet and costs of the operation indicated the president of the state oil company the ebitda of the oil company stood at   trillion ebitda margin of  and another of the elements highlighted by the president of ecopetrol was that they managed to maintain the differential of the crude sales basket at close levels to those of  in the first quarter the differential was us   per barrel an improvement of  compared to the differential observed in the first quarter of the previous year stated bayon additionally the fact of having consolidated a more efficient cost structure was reflected in the first balance of the year favorable results were expected due to a better oil price a reduction in expenses lower leverage and the results of an efficiency program that the company has been using in the last two years said diego franco cofounder of franco values finally regarding the behavior of the transportation business the firm indicated that the san fernandomonterrey system came into operation key to the strategy of evacuating extraheavy crude to this was added the reversion strategy in the bicentenario pipeline implemented since  which according to the oil company made it possible to reduce the impact of the attacks on the cano limon  covenas pipeline and maintain the flow of operations in the cano limon field and other surrounding fields during the first quarter of  the cano limon  covenas system was in operation for  days a situation that prompted the completion of  reversal cycles bancolombias preferential was the best performing stock at the close of the trading day on the colombian stock exchange bvc the most traded share was preferencial bancolombia with   million followed by ecopetrol with   million and the third most traded was the banks ordinary with   million for its part the banks preferred security was also the one with the highest appreciation with a rise of  to   conconcreto followed with a rise of  and canacol closed the top three with an improvement of    on the other hand the main falls were registered in the shares of the holding grupo argos with  to   and in its subsidiary cementos argos with  to  calm down with the mini oil bonanza if things continue as they are the first half of this year will be the best in almost two decades at least in terms of the economy a statement that can be shocking reckless and inopportune due to the political fever we are going through less than a month after the first presidential round but if we decompose the statement we see that everything is true when looking at fundamentals such as economic growth in terms of gdp that will be about  at the end of this  unemployment which has dropped to  inflation that does not exceed  the interest rates that tend to fall and stand at  at the same time the representative market rate has offered relief for importers for several weeks averaging   a good portfolio of economic indicators closely linked to what is happening with the price of oil in international markets which on average are around us   regardless of brent or wti as always bittersweet news it is good that oil rises but bad because it dangerously revalues the colombian peso which has shown that a change of   is what benefits everyone both exporters and importers obviously one thing is the fundamentals of the macroeconomy and quite another compared to what happens with consumer confidence which has not recovered so far this year and remains as depressed as the same installed capacity of companies which does not feel the improvement in terms of reactivation of general consumption synchronizing the two economic situations good fundamentals with consumer expectations is a matter of time the passage of months and surely everything begins to match once there is political clarity in terms of economic models the safest thing is that the good indicators  thanks to oil  and the expectations of consumers businessmen and local regional and national governments will begin to work together now this mini oil bonanza must be taken very calmly even if the situation harbors hopes of improvement the dane published export data for march that registered a growth of  compared to the same month of the previous year totaling us   million all thanks to the prices of oil and other products of the extractive industries which increased  up to us   million in general sales of oil petroleum products and related products rose by  this good situation is felt with everything in ecopetrol which reported the best quarter in four years between january and march they generated an improvement in the income and profits of the joint venture sales amounted to   billion which represented an increase of  compared to the same period of the previous year and its net profits totaled   billion  more than between january and march  all a good panorama that cannot make us saddle the horses before having them on hand cannot begin the feast of the accounts happy with royalties much less neglecting issues as dangerous for the economy as the growth of the overdue bank portfolio that does not drop below  a yellow warning light in the face of mild recovery windsecopetrol continues to rise and those who invested in  are among the most favored the oil company released its financial results for the first quarter on thursday highlighting that they were the best in four years and surprising the market

invested five years three years one year six months ago and at the beginning of  the results taking into account the current price of the share which at the close of the colombian stock exchange market bvc was at   showed that in  that is two years ago was when the better earnings with  valuation versus price which was close to   at the time continuing with the measure of the highest percentages those who invested six months ago october today have gains of  a year ago  when it was trading at   and at the beginning of   when the stock was at   the only negative variation in the study continues to be that of five years ago with a decrease of  since investors bought at about   according to the financial results reported by the company and the positive behavior that oil has been having so far this year the analysts consulted by lr expect that at the end of next week the value of the share will be   and we estimate that the results in  will continue to be positive likewise that the profits will be higher at the end of this year than those obtained in  according to the results that they released for the first quarter of  it is expected that there will be better dividends paid taking into account for example the recovery of the cartagena refinery said felipe espitia economic analyst at alianza valores from the report presented by the oil company already taking into account for the behavior in the second semester and yearend for the action the sales of the company that amounted to   billion stand out which represented an increase of   compared to the same period of the previous year and its net profits totaled   trillion  more than between january and march  for carlos rodriguez an analyst at ultraserfinco ecopetrols action will depend on oil prices on the international market that it cannot control and on something that if they control the expenses for efficiencies that so far look pretty good analysts expect the price of the dollar to be at   for this week on the last day of the previous week the dollar was pressured downwards by the rise in oil prices which reached levels not seen since the end of  to us   with this outlook according to analysts it is expected that the commodity may continue to rise due to events such as the sanctions that the us imposes on iran and the announcement that was made on friday afternoon about the serious crisis that pdvsa is going through and that i would force them to close with this the north american currency would stop its climb and would be close to   according to the survey carried out by lr for next week the euro will average   wti oil at us   and colcap at  units for natalia granados analyst at global securities a high volatility has been observed in the colombian peso recently after having been close to   and being one of the currencies with the highest appreciation in the last six months against the dollar it weakens again surpassing the   level on the upside and again close to the congestion level at    that being the case the most probable thing according to the estimates is that it will remain at this level of      and the increases that the currency had been presenting last week will be stopped on the other hand with the rise in oil prices which may increase if certain events take place this week it is likely that a new mini rally will be felt in stocks for this reason in the local market it is likely that the colcap index will continue the positive trend after some quite positive results for ecopetrol since the stock that registered an advance of  in the last week and is close to maximum of the last four years at   this same indicator during fridays trading session on the colombian stock exchange closed at  units for juan david ballen an analyst at casa de bolsa the weakness of the euro will also be reflected in the colombian peso which in the last  days has shown a significant drop faced with the prospects for oil he added it was known by the minister of oil in venezuela that pdvsa could collapse and to add to that the trump sanctions on iran they would make the price of oil rise significantly due to a supply shock ballen explained that another factor that is occurring is that the majority of emerging currencies and the region have entered a cycle of very strong weakness next week there will be important events to take into account that will mark the behavior of the main market indicators dollar euro wti oil and colcap some of these are in colombia on may  there will be tes interest payments uvr  on may  there will be a bond issue from banco popular while in international events the update of shortterm oil expectations will be known by the united states energy information administration eia and the decision of the us on the sanctions that may be imposed on iran will be known  against this background oil could maintain an upward trend for the rest of the year pushing the dollar downa barrel of oil at us    the influential english newspaper the financial times explains the rise in oil prices in five situations supply and demand supply has declined markedly in the last  months crude stocks that had accumulated in the  period have declined considerably due to high demand driven by a booming world economy and supply cuts two opec and russia most operators think that although moscow has stated that it is concerned that oil is more than us   and this encourages rival suppliers such as us unconventional hydrocarbon producers to extract more crude seems to be happy for now that saudi arabia which is preparing to go public for aramco would benefit from the high price of oil three geopolitical risks the oil market is always keeping a close eye on the risks arising from supply disruptions that can upset the delicate balance of supply and demand the most immediate risk is the very real possibility that the united states will withdraw from the iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on its oil exports  the other is venezuela whose oil production has decreased by at least  barrels per day due to the economic and political crisis it is going through and it is unlikely that pdvsa will be able to reverse the trend  the risk of an asymmetric supply disruption is even greater than in the arab spring  the fourth factor that the financial exposes has to do with the hedge fund which in the opinion of the newspaper already had a great presence in the market his investment at the beginning of the year set an alltime high large speculative investments are usually a warning sign that a market has become unbalanced increasing the risk of a selloff if traders want to make large profits from that sale but not so far this year has happened bankers say the reason is that much of the investment in oil is longterm to take advantage of latecycle assets such as commodities  and the last factor is unconventional hydrocarbons from the united states  the us shale is exceeding growth expectations and its production is expected to grow this year by approximately   million barrels per day  us producers are also generating free cash flows due to the price increase but so far they have not been enough to stop this rise since the increase in demand has largely absorbed the increased production if we look at the whole global panorama the five factors set out above we must take into consideration that the oil country  used to complaining even in the midst of good prices  must take careful note that high values will remain like this in the medium term and that investment projects must be reactivated with caution crude oil cannot be kept underground with a barrel above us   extraction efforts must be redoubled in order to obtain the benefits they have been four years of lean cows that begin to change and the oil sector must value it that waythe ceiling of the oil boom would be at us   per barrel in  according to analysts oil yesterday reached its maximum since november   reaching a value of us   per barrel tension over the nuclear deal with iran venezuelas production deficit and saudi arabias possible intention to maintain a high price to benefit its oil company saudi aramco are some of the factors that have generated the current crude boom lr consulted industry experts and analysts to determine future projections for the commoditys value most conclude that the rise in prices is temporary and that in the medium term end of the year the cost of this would have a downward movement after having overcome some stages and conditions that keep it at its highest level in recent periods francisco lloreda director of the colombian petroleum association acp mentions that according to the analysis of the union the average price of oil in the medium term will be us   per barrel arguing that the increase in recent days is momentary and is explained by the possibility that irans offer will be reduced due to sanctions and that venezuela will not be able to maintain production however in the short term there are some stock market analysts who project an average of us   per barrel which would be the maximum ceiling for mineral precisely as a result of the development of those geopolitical conflicts that could occur in a recent period see graph  precisely the president of the united states donald trump announced yesterday through his social networks that he will make a decision about iran around  pm today washington time which would solve part of the expectation related article trump criticizes opec and says that it will not accept high oil prices meanwhile the longterm projection changes since all the sources consulted agree on projecting a barrel price of less than us   by the end of the year diego velasquez an analyst at valoralta assures that this occurs because there could be a deaccumulation of inventories that generates a shock between demand and supply that allows the price to be regulated this added to the fact that the united states has increased its production level and it would be the second or first largest oil producer increasing the supply for this period juan david ballen director of investigations at casa de bolsa reinforces this idea by ensuring that the united states it raises oil production rapidly generating a decrease in the power of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set prices  lloreda adds that for companies including ecopetrol the increase in prices is beneficial and at the same time the country because it gives them a greater margin to invest in both production and exploration which should translate into an increase in reserves in energy security and in fiscal resources royalties and dividends  otman gordillo an analyst at adcap assured in this regard that ecopetrol shareholders have benefited the most from seeing a vigorous recovery of the stock of more than  for those who invested two years ago and that it could even touch the   in the next few monthsthe amount collected by the tax administration rose  points in  years taxes have always been one of the most critical issues for both the government which needs resources to cover public spending as for the private sector which complains of the high weight of the tax burden in the operation which they assure can range from  to  despite the constant requests by representatives and actors of the economic sectors taxes have been the resource most used by governments to settle accounts in times of deficit since the  constitution the count of the number of reforms that have been made to the countrys tax structure is long although there are several laws that have modified taxes or their surcharges there are at least  major changes in these  years which leaves a new tax reform on average every  months six of these reforms have been carried out in the last  years although the result is poor since taxation as a measure of gross domestic product gdp has barely grown by  percentage points between  and  as we will see below the main result of these modifications has been an exponential growth in the amount collected by the national tax and customs directorate dian which has grown as follows in  the collection of national taxes was   trillions in  beginning the new century the amount grew to   billion in  it was   billion in  the tax collection already reached   billion and in  the last full year for which there are accounts taxation in the country totaled   billion related article the boards of directors of the companies that sold the most in  the gross increase in collection shows that since the new constitution there has been a variation of  when reviewing only the last  years  the increase in the amount collected by the administration was  although several analysts such as sergio olarte director of economic studies at btg pactual highlighted the evident growth in gross amounts they specified that to really measure the effect of collection this data must be reviewed as a proportion of gross domestic product gdp since it allows incorporating behaviors of foreign trade gross capital formation public spending inflation among other factors by putting the collection as a proportion of the size of the countrys economy taxation has not increased in the way it is reflected only with the amount of the collection taking the year  as a reference the share of taxes on the national economy was barely  since in that year the gross domestic product at current prices of that same year was   billion when reviewing the behavior of collection in the last  years the increase is not significant in  the national gdp was   trillion at current prices which translates into a collection of  while in  latest complete data the amount collected by the dian represented   as a proportion of the gross domestic product of   billion according to the figures reported by the administration regarding the changes in the tax structure especially in the last decade jose manuel restrepo rector of the universidad del rosario said that this high number of changes in the countrys tax rules has its origin in the inability of the presidents to assume responsibility that this entails avoiding the need for a tax reform governments do not assume a political cost with a longterm and substantive reform but rather seek to resolve the fiscal crisis of that moment and for that reason the next leaders must seek to resolve their urgencies he said in fact several international reports show that taxation remains low in contrast to other countries in the region the report tax statistics in latin america and the caribbean prepared by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean eclac and the interamerican center of tax administrations ciat they place colombia in the middle of the continent below the average tax rate as a percentage of gdp in the oecd countries which is  according to the agencys figures corresponding to the  collection the countrys collection is only above seven countries el salvador dominican republic venezuela peru panama mexico paraguay and guatemala while countries such as cuba they achieve a taxation of  of their economy brazil reaches  of taxation as a percentage of gdp argentina achieves  chile reaches  among the most significant to this must be added according to restrepo that this low capacity for taxation and management of resources leaves negative effects such as the loss of competitiveness in the country a fact that is evidenced in the fall of positions in the rankings such as the doing business in which the country ranked  in the last edition what has been incorporated related article in the tax of  the change was made to lower the burden of companies in the course of these  years of reforms some taxes have been added such as the wealth tax  created in  and was stopped collecting in  the tax on financial movements  cree gasoline tax and consumption tax  and wealth  but the structure has not varied and continues to depend on income and vat as highlighted by professor and member of the public expenditure commission jorge ivan gonzalez what one sees is that the last tax reform has the least is equity and does not correspond to what the national government had said about improving this element said gonzalez and pointed out that in the case of income it is believed progressive it is only in the middle class and then it flattens because a person who earns   million or more will pay the same rate the vat put  of the taxes collected in  gross collection according to dian that is   billion which seen as a proportion of gdp is equivalent to  of the national economy in the case of income and complementary taxes the collection was   trillion which translates into a weight in gdp of  most of it comes from taxes generated in domestic activity with   billion according to dian another phenomenon that affects collection is evasion some estimates suggest that it reaches   billion annually and on which the latest reform is focused which improved the tools to declare tax exemptions do not have a positive effect related article exito group remains in the first place of the top  companies in the commerce sector hand in hand with the increases in collections the number of exemptions also grew one of them is the hydrocarbon sector according to tax justice accounts between  and  it cost the colombian treasury   billion to maintain different types of benefits for the mining and hydrocarbon sector a fact that did not materialize in greater growth or greater investments for other sectors mario valencia spokesman for this study center believes that sector policies should be reoriented to provide public resources in order to correct the fiscal deficit the  companies with the most revenue in  financial sector results in how much do the firms with the highest income pay in income tax related article the boards of directors of the companies that sold the most in  in the annual financial reports there is a figure that is not very prominent but that weighs heavily on a companys operating expenses it is about taxes and here we present a ranking prepared with the top  of the companies that invoiced more than   billion one of the exercises carried out in this report was to ask the companies that sell the most in colombia how much the tax burden weighs on their balance sheets related article nutresa and colanta were the leaders in food despite the fall in the sector of the top  companies that appear in the ranking of the most sold last year only reficar comcelclaro exxonmobil colombia une epm telecomunicaciones tigo and compensar refrained from giving that information a comparative work was carried out with the rest of the firms to learn about cases such as for example ecopetrol which had revenues of   billion and spent   billion in taxes on income last year the second company on this list that contributes the most is isa whose revenues totaled   billion and allocated   million in taxes epm also stands out with a turnover of   billion and   million in tax payments in  the  companies with the most revenue in  financial sector results in ecopetrol does not give up its position as the leader in hydrocarbons a fact that marked the oil sector in  both in colombia and in the world was the recovery of international oil prices which had a very low level between  and  when they fell more than  due to an excess supply and a slowdown in demand thanks to this prices were below us   related article grupo exito remains in the first place of the top  companies in the trade sector on the other hand last year due to cuts in supplies from the member countries of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec the price the average oil in the brent benchmark was us    more than in  the price of a barrel started the year at us   and after falling in june to less than us   it rebounded in the second half to us   related article in the tax of  the change was made to lower the burden of companies according to the president of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol german espinosa the recovery was evident in the increase in the budgets of  and in the financial results of ecopetrol which generated net profits of   billion and paid its shareholders   per share for the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon these results are not only due to the rise in international prices but also to the transformation plan that was implemented in the company to mitigate the price crisis in addition in  the performance test of the cartagena refinery reficar was carried out its  plants all operated passing the tests and in december the global performance test was successfully carried out he said according to ecopetrol the average life of the reserves increased from  years to  years  barrels of crude these figures place the oil company in first place in the sector by income adding   billion this is  more than in    billion it is followed by reficar also from ecopetrol with revenues of   billion which also represented an increase in revenues this time of  and in third place is frontera energy formerly pacific rubiales with revenues of   billion an increase of  compared to  another reason that helped the good results of the oil companies in  was that several tax incentives for this industry one of these was the regulation of the tax refund certificate cert which seeks to promote investment in hydrocarbon exploration and oil production by allowing companies to obtain a redeemable bond for the payment of taxes for each dollar of investment additional related article the amount collected by the tax administration rose  points in  years likewise the tax works decree was regulated with which companies can propose projects that accelerate growth and benefit the communities of the most affected areas due to the armed conflict zomac and have reduced rates in income tax additionally the  tax reform entered into force which introduced a reduction in the tax burden for colombian and foreign companies operating in the country it is also worth noting that in  the goal of drilling  exploratory wells was exceeded among which is molusco with which ecopetrol is the operator of an off shore project for the first time in addition with the gorgon and purple angel wells a new gas province was discovered in the colombian caribbean sea in conclusion  was a year of transition for the sector and it is expected that this year its recovery will be consolidated the  companies with the most revenue in  financial sector results in the value of the premier league is

but who is behind the boards of these companies lr shows you who are the characters behind the decisionmaking what profession they have and what is their alma mater related article the amount collected by the tax administration rose  points in  years for example in the case of grupo exito its board of directors is made up of nine members four of them independent its president is the one who until a few years ago held the reins of isa luis fernando alarcon if you look at ecopetrols board of directors it has seven independent members and two that are not its president is carlos cure

results in grupo exito continues to lead the ranking of the  companies that bill the most at the end of last year the list of the  companies that invoiced the most in colombia according to an lr survey remained almost intact compared to the  operation in the top  of the companies that sold the most the first variation was found specifically with the firm that took third place on the podium the three companies with the highest turnover in  were grupo exito with   billion ecopetrol with   billion and the terpel organization with   billion this ranking in  was made up of the same players in the first grupo exito with   billion and second ecopetrol with   billion but in the third box was epm with revenues of   billion  in this new ranking epm dropped to fourth position by registering operating income of   billion the list of the  companies that sold the most in colombia is completed grupo argos with revenues of   billion avianca with   billion reficar with   billion grupo nutresa with   billion cementos argos with   billion and comcelclaro with   billion the second change that is observed in the table of the companies that sold the most in  is that isa leaves the top  that this newspaper presented for  last year the energy company was in position  with operating income of   trillions in  it was in position  with a turnover of   billion in general of the  companies that registered the most operating income in  the health and public services sectors are the ones with the most companies on the list in total the  companies added operating income last year to the tune of

occurred snubbing unit operations were successfully concluded this was the specialized team that ecopetrol brought in to seal the formation in the area near barrancabermeja the oil company reported through a statement that the cement safety packing and plugs were installed in the well which will prevent the fluids from reaching the surface again and with this conclude the main sealing activities of the well later the technical abandonment of the well would begin so that it is completely insured related article the attorney generals office asked ecopetrol for compensation for the damage in lizama at the same time work continues to rehabilitate the area and the species that were affected at the site of the outcrop on the santo tomas property located  meters from the well while other organizations carry out investigations corresponding to the sanctions that the company may facethose most impacted with the msci change next week in colombia next week the rebalancing of the us weighting msci will be known which could impact colombias preferred shares if a series of conditions occurs according to german cristancho manager of economic and strategic research at davivienda corredores a great impact for colombian companies is not estimated at the moment however the expert assures that although it is a low risk if a different weighting is presented or new companies are integrated colombian companies such as ecopetrol and bancolombia could be affected as well as all participants belonging to emerging economies  cristancho points out that this phenomenon can occur mainly because for some months the change of argentina from a status of border country to emerging country while on the other hand china could have new enlistments although the expert is cautious in ensuring that these events do not have a high probability however one must be careful according to david ballen an analyst at casa de bolsa there is a possibility that colombia will decrease participation because china gains the same in emerging indices the official also assures that the changes that are announced the following week would be effective only from june  of the current yeara barrel of crude at us   doubles the investment of oil companies the crisis in oil prices which affected the colombian economy in the last three years could be overcome now that the international price of crude is between us   and us   per barrel this scenario although it varies depending on the geopolitical factors of the different regions of the world today it causes oil companies to do the math not only to improve their efficiency in savings but also to double their investments in production and exploration in the country if this trend is maintained at an average of us   per barrel wti and brent the government and businessmen would be the big winners this year the established goals were to reach about  barrels in  a little more than  barrels in  and up to  in  however the national hydrocarbons agency anh recently said that the figure this year would reach up to  barrels per day these values in general terms would leave behind the bad streak of the sector ecopetrol is undoubtedly one of the companies that has best taken advantage of the rise in prices after achieving savings of nearly   trillion in the past three years the company has managed to overcome the hurdles under its efficiencies and transformation program undoubtedly higher prices are reflected in better income for the company the increase should be taken with great caution because there is a marked volatility in the prices clarified felipe bayon president of the company who explained that for this year they will invest between us   and us   million which represents an increase of between   and  compared to the real investment of last year another oil company that welcomes a barrel of oil at us   is frontera energy formerly pacific ep the company indicated that for now it is focused on reactivating exploration activity where it is present in fact he clarified that this year it will make investments close to us   million and us   million which means that it doubled the figure compared to the previous year with this expense frontera expects to drill  development wells  exploratory wells and  workover wells equion energia limited is one of the companies that believes that high prices not only serve to save but also to add value in the processes for maria victoria riano president of the company in reality it is not just about saving or restricting activity but about finding innovative ways to do more with the same such as finding economies of scale in hiring the directive clarified that the fact of having higher prices today requires following rigorous investment project approval processes however he did emphasize that in line with what has been working there is a projected investment of us   million for the development of activity that allows maintaining the production base if more projects are carried out the company would have to consult with its shareholders ecopetrol and repsol to adjust a new budget that will allow it to increase oil and gas production this for now is not yet contemplated according to riano the multinational geopark is also another of the companies that continues to bet on the development of the sector in the country at the beginning of the year the company announced that for  it would invest close to us   million to continue the development and evaluation of the tigana  jacana fields and to target new exploration prospects in the llanos  block positive the oil companies believe that  will be a year of recovery and expansion it is expected that although the price of crude oil maintains its volatility that value will continue in the upward trend which will allow the companies investment plan to continue why are public finances improving the minister of finance mauricio cardenas clarified days ago that this higher price will benefit the next government because it will have income that it was not expecting the immediate impact of the rise in prices has been seen in the higher earnings in exports which lower the trade deficit and in the exchange rate  to this is added that with this price range it will be possible to give financial viability to more exploration projects in the country which generates not only greater income for the government but also greater business developmentecopetrol terpel and exito are the largest companies by sales the superintendency of companies headed by francisco reyes presented the financial balance of the  largest companies in the country which for the first time since  presented all their reports under international financial standards according to the report ecopetrol terpel and exito are the largest companies in the country by revenues are sales of   billion   billion and   billion respectively the cartagena refinery with   billion and comcel with   billion completed the ranking of the top five the superintendency noted that the income of the  companies amounted to   billion with a growth of  the ranking by earnings was led by ecopetrol with   billion cenit with   billion and epm with   billion next came grupo aval with   billion and bavaria with   billionthe recovery of oil marked corporate results in  for the superintendent of companies francisco reyes there are two reasons that drove the good results last year of the  largest companies in colombia the first is the good performance of the industry and the second the recovery in oil prices are the figures satisfactory compared to the performance of the country in  it is important to point out that this information refers to the  largest companies in the country not all companies and that we also collected reports not only from the supersociedades but also from the superfinancial supersalud superservices and supervigilance the results are very favorable there are significant recoveries particularly in revenue  and earnings  this is due not only to the good performance of the real sector and of industry and commerce but also to the recovery in the price of oil which marked the results in hydrocarbons it is important to note that in addition to mining and oil companies we have a very diversified universe do you think there was excess

americas which posted an increase of  and queiroz galvao exploracao e producao qgep which registered  all three are included among the  companies with the highest percentage change in shares per year amid the oil rebound the rise in oil prices is associated with two main factors the imposition of us sanctions on iran following the recent decision by president donald trump to abandon the denuclearization agreement and the probable drops in oil supplies from mexico angola and venezuela which as a country belonging to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec probably cannot generate the same production and offers of crude oil that it had been presenting in recent months for its economic crisis on the other hand opec led by saudi arabia and  other countries together with russia has registered a  decrease in excess crude inventories in western countries and a reduction in production amounting to  million barrels a day since january  the contrasts diego

uncertainty generated by the sanctions imposed by the united states on iran has caused some companies such as the french total sa to announce that they would stop making purchases from iran however taking into account that in the nuclear agreement with iran there were also france great britain germany russia and china countries that want to continue buying crude the discussion will continue to be monitored as well as the accumulation of inventories which also generated important movements yesterday with the rise of brent in the colombian case ecopetrol was the company in the country with the best percentage variation of shares with  adcaps fixed income and dollar analyst diego blanco mentioned that international crude prices have made ecopetrol present an important appreciation also associated with the latest statements of the company which came out on the first quarter of  considered as the best quarterly results of the company in the last four years the price of crude that ecopetrol had as a reference for this year was us   and reaching us   is favorable for the company said the analystaccurate financial information and delivered on time the financial information of companies is invaluable it helps its administrators owners and creditors to make decisions that are appropriate to their interests for the state it is also crucial since it allows the exercise of the powers of inspection when they are required to preserve economic public order in colombia we were used to receiving information from companies under outdated and anachronistic guidelines the famous single plan of accounts served for more than two decades to classify the balance sheet accounts and to refine the results of the year the country remained in a kind of accounting isolation with sui generis rules with a marked local accent this reality accepted by all forced foreign investors on more than one occasion to translate or reexpress the various items on the balance sheet in order to envision an understandable financial picture the generally accepted accounting standards in colombia contained in the until recently untouchable decree  of  prevented the adequate reflection of the economic situation of the companies this parochial and provincial vision has radically changed thanks to the adoption of the international financial reporting standards ifrs our country has become in tune with contemporary realities and although there was great skepticism about the viability of adopting these new guidelines by colombian companies the truth is that the governments insistence on the relevance of this conceptual change facilitated the miracle to occur the effort made by colombian companies with the support of the superintendency of companies allowed the definitive transition to a nomenclature that is comprehensible modern and adapted to international standards all this effort will surely have an impact on better opportunities for colombian entrepreneurs as the way in which they provide their financial information to local and foreign investors as well as to credit institutions becomes more reasonable new sources of access to capital resources will surely emerge supersociedades has ensured that this enormous work of colombian companies to comply with the new accounting standards has tangible and immediate benefits for the business community for this reason it has made available a business information portal accessible online httppiesupersociedadesgovco in which the financial information of more than  medium and large companies is displayed that they are required to report their financial statements to the entity users will find in addition to the figures of the main financial statements relevant data on social administrators and tax auditors and basic financial indices to the extent that all companies made the effective transition to ifrs since  the data available for the last two accounting years are fully comparable in other words the analysis of the main accounts can be done with uniform criteria due to the existence of a homogeneous accounting nomenclature thus the variations in the different items studied assets liabilities equity income and profits are due to the circumstances of the industry and market fluctuations instead of being due to simple accounting effects and from this objective assessment it can be concluded that  was a better year than its predecessor at least for large companies on the one hand operating income increased  and profits  there were also significant increases in assets and equity of the companies analyzed thus we can affirm that in the  largest companies in the country there is enormous potential and a gigantic capacity to create wealth and employment for a country where creativity and entrepreneurship are notorious for the rest the enormous diversity of economic activities that can be appreciated in the exhibition is an eloquent testimony of the possibilities that our business community has the figures released by the superintendency are objective lack makeup and are devoid of any demagogic exaggeration these are clear results that allow us to presage if things continue as

highest preference ecopetrol has also been in three of the five selections that have been made so far this year thus otman gordillo analyst at adcap colombia clarified that there are still opportunities for appreciation el exito has a normal risk profile so in theory it will improve the share price consumption is recovering so there are good options to invest ecopetrol for its part not much as an asset that is too speculative that is exposed to the international price of crude oil  the survey also detailed that sociopolitical conditions continue to be the most important factor to analyze when investing and noted that with the elections this factor increased from  to  added to this variable was economic growth which ranked as the second most important factor after going from

appreciation of the index in the next three months it is important to highlight that this proportion increased by  percentage points compared to last months results  now it is worth clarifying that

sector however there is evidence of a reduction in the preference for shares in the oil holding and financial sectors in the last year there has also been a reduction of preference in the consumer

tecnoglass celsia and ecopetrol were the three companies with the highest growth in this area after achieving an increase in profits of   and  respectively the companies took advantage of the macroeconomic environment and boosted their investment programs tecnoglass for example closed the first three months with profits of   million which allowed a  growth in this item its sales in turn closed with a positive variable of  after totaling   million we started the year with solid growth in sales in the united states and colombia which increased more than  particularly in colombia we continue to perceive a positive macroeconomic environment that should allow us to continue capitalizing on the market  clarified jose manuel daes president of tecnoglass celsia continued on the list of top earners with a  increase in earnings after reaching   million in this area the grupo argos subsidiary had operating income of   a figure that left a positive variation of  the colombian company ecopetrol continued to surprise in  after reaching   billion in profits and a growth of  after closing last year with sales of   billion according to supersociedades the oil company also saved  million this was confirmed by felipe bayon president of ecopetrol who clarified that in the first quarter of this year with an average crude price of us   per barrel we had savings of   million compared to   million in the first quarter of   when the average price of crude oil was us   per barrel the approved investment plan for this year ranges between us   billion and us   billion  the top

other companies that grew were avianca with    million grupo epm with    million isa with    million and colombina with    million it is important to clarify that grupo exito also obtained significant growth as of march however its variation was not included as it went from losing   million in  to earning   million this year those that sold the most in terms of revenues the top three of the largest companies were led by ecopetrol with sales of   billion as of march followed by grupo exito with   billion and grupo sura with   billion the first five places on the list were closed by the terpel organization with   billion in sales and grupo epm with   billion avianca and grupo argos for their part were two boxes down with operating income of   billion and   billion the top  of the most

company ecopetrol have received the positive impact of the recovery in the oil price which so far has risen  and stands at us   per barrel for the brent benchmark according to information provided by the colombian stock exchange ecopetrols share shows a positive variation of  reaching a value of   after having closed at   in its previous closing oil is recovering after yesterday extending the decline that ended last week on monday it had hit its lowest level in around three weeks after announcements from opec countries that seemed to indicate a pause in agreements on production cuts ecopetrol earns about us   million for every dollar that rises a barrel while according to accounts of the minister of finance mauricio cardenas each dollar of increase in the price of crude oil represents tax revenues of   million a year later for the country so that the government and the company are the main beneficiaries with a recoverythe fics boosted the results of the brokerage firms despite the bad moment the markets went through in the first months of the year  of the  brokerage firms reported positive figures to the financial superintendence as of april this according to experts was generated by the strategy that the entities have had with the collective investment funds fics and the momentum generated in some by the rebound in ecopetrols shares in the fourth month of the year the top five of the firms with the best results are headed by valores bancolombia and credicorp capital which have distinguished themselves by taking over the first places in terms of profits these two companies are followed by corredores davivienda btg pactual and ultraserfinco with earnings of   million   million and   million respectively according to andres moreno market analyst these stock brokers understood for a few years that they have to cover their fixed costs before the month begins and they do this with collective investment funds for this reason the fics give the possibility that as soon as the month begins they will be able to cover their minimum costs and the rest they require when analyzing the report of funds so far this year valores bancolombia leads the income ranking with   million which represents  of the total it is followed by credicorp capital with  which translates into   million corredores davivienda with  and a value in funds of   million and citivalores sa with   million now the recovery of the colombian oil company ecopetrol also had an effect on the reported results of some commission agents before the control entity in the period because after presenting a low performance in its price that ranged between   and   between  and   three years later its value doubled allowing a recovery in its clients who had lost a lot of money and is that according to moreno for example  of ecopetrol shareholders are in global securities so this combined with the strategy in the fics has generated that certain firms achieve very positive results for maria teresa uribe president of davivienda corredores the specific positive results of the commission agent are generated because they are clear about the products that we want to weigh more within our total income basket today the products that weigh the most which are the collective investment funds fic and in the international issue we manage to make them those with the most important growth within davivienda corredores  however although for davivienda corredores the growth of ecopetrol has been important because it gives greater confidence to the colombian stock market this is especially not due to the growth in profits and the good performance of the firm so far this year the contrasts luis miguel gonzalez president of credicorp capital in particular in investment banking and trust businesses we see good prospects for the second half of the year maria teresa uribe president davivienda corredores today the products that weigh the most which are the collective investment funds and the international issue are those that have performed well results of commission agents at the end of the year last year although the firms valores bancolombia and credicorp capital also occupied the first places in the superfinanciera report the commissioning firm that presented significant growth was davivienda corredores which went from occupying sixth place to third

and continued to approach us   per share which is the maximum price that the company has achieved in this market this year at the beginning of the session the good numbers of ecopetrol seemed to go hand in hand with the recovery in oil prices however at the end of the session they again presented red numbers diego franco director of franco capital group pointed out this fact commenting that when investors want to enter colombia they have certain preferential shares due to their liquidity among them ecopetrol so the fact that brent started higher could impact franco also noted that international investors were able to hear reports from foreign banks that take for granted that the rightwing candidate is the one who wins the presidential elections favoring investment daniel escobar director of strategy at global securities mentions that the rise is also due to a correction which is why the market has fallen lately however he added that the colombian market yesterday had

invested in more than  million titles the new york company acquired more than  million indeed jpmorgan was the main buyer of ecopetrols shares with a variation of  at the beginning of the year while grupo argos took the lead with the issuance made by its subsidiary celsia now despite the fact that in the preferred share of bancolombia another of the most traded the protagonist was horizon a firm that came to buy more than  million shares of the colombian bank this entity made several sales that put it as the one that it sold the most among the firms after leaving  million ecopetrol shares juan david ballen director of investigations at casa de bolsa explained that these reports must be read as net purchases and sales because a firm may have bought a certain amount of shares and sold them at the beginning of the month to earn returns several purchase transactions and advantages can be presented such as an investor having sold a certain amount but has compensated by buying from another  these figures are comparable with the market participants report prepared by davivienda corredores with data up to the month of may this shows that although foreigners are the ones who sold the largest amount of money in shares during may   million natural persons continue to lead in the list of those who have made the most sales of securities showing an additional reality in the analysis so far in  ordinary investors have sold a total of   million in shares with ecopetrol being the share that has seen the largest leakage of this group with a total of   million individuals in bancolombias preferred stock have sold for their part a total of   million so far this year the contrasts german cristancho head of economic research davivienda brokers we hope that moving forward the dynamics of the equity market will change and purchases will be made in a greater diversity of assets and names once the electoral issue is over juan david ballen director of brokerage house research with the same money that an investor tries to invest in the stock market he can enter a collective investment fund that is being more diversified german cristancho head of economic research at davivienda corredores assured that as of today there are very few stocks in which natives are buyers and it is also evident that they are switching to other types of investment vehicles such as funds of collective investment that show them and generate very important diversification advantages  ballen for his part says that it is evident that natural persons not only so far this year but in the long term increasingly decrease their participation in the stock market while etfs and investment funds grow  the analyst reinforces the idea that many small investors are switching to collective investment funds because of the advantages they represent in front of foreigners who during may sold their shares the most cristancho says that they were probably motivated by the uncertainty generated by the political issue added to the fact that the assets they sold such as ecopetrol and bancolombia are the most liquid and had good returns  in may adrs were the ones that bought the most with an amount of   million this was driven by   million in the bancolombia preferential and   million in ecopetrol highlights of the month among the most important events in may are the outflow of

one that fell the most with a fall of  according to erika baquero equity analyst at alianza valores colcap is closely tied to the movement of the bancolombia and ecopetrol shares which are the ones that mark the stop in the indicator and what we observe is that these actions picked up part of this positivism due to the arrival of the candidate despite the fact that it was already discounted in most of the market  the analyst added that this positivism of some investors could also be seen in the prices of colombians abroad where for example the adr of bancolombia grew  and that of ecopetrol  which are positive figures despite the day the markets had where it could be said that despite being news that was already expected it did influence the decisions of some investors he added now despite the fact that the political risk dissipated and that oil also had a positive behavior that normally boosts the colombian peso in the exchange session the strengthening of the dollar at a

devalued in contrast to the stocks that did present a positive performance so in this case we believe that the duque effect was already  discounted and what we can see is that the currency is becoming more closely linked to the behavior of emerging market currencies  regarding the projections the analyst added that beyond the stock and capital markets what is expected is that investments more focused on the real sector will be reactivated in the second semester which could have been held back by economic expectations finally according to fitch duques victory should support continuity in economic policy including inflation targets and a flexible exchange rate regime although the growth boost and fiscal consolidation will be key challenges for his administration the contrasts juan

agreement with the farc could be a source of uncertainty duques campaign promoted modifications to the agreement  and an increased uncertainty regarding its implementation could increase political polarization in this regard and affect investor confidence and therefore put growth at risk  changes in the msci index put participation of colombian stocks at risk the colombian stock market will have to be aware of the rebalancing of the msci index that will take place today your participation percentage as an emerging country and the weight of your preferred shares may vary depending on the determinations made the first factor that could affect its participation as a country is the fact that when carrying out an annual review of the classification of the belonging countries segmented into border emerging or developed countries in ascending taxonomic order it is waiting for a possible entry of argentina and saudi arabia to the category of emerging countries from their position as border countries this would generate the effect of a restructuring in the percentage participation of emerging countries in the index removing participation from colombia among them diego franco director of franco group sa says that by losing weight of participation in the index the phenomenon that would be generated would be sales and that the company that would be most affected would be bancolombia the second issue for which the colombian market will have to be pending is the expectation that a pronouncement will be generated about reducing the weight of preferred shares within the

presence are hydrocarbons finance and energy however there are a large number of lower value holdings in the transport communications agriculture and health sectors the growth of the consolidated

radio in the study they also expect to receive contingency plans for any unforeseen eventgoodbye to the first semester the uncertainty passed at the same time as the first half of the year the one that begins will not only be the last week of june but the end of the first great economic cycle the first three months of the year were marked by the political frenzy typical of the election of a new congress of the republic which incidentally has immense economic challenges and great social expectations the following months from april to june were heated by the campaign for the presidency of the republic that was finally won by the candidate who represented the continuation of the economic model the support for the free market the defense of private property but above all it enjoyed the backing of multilateral banks risk rating firms business associations and more than  million colombians thus ended the half of the year that has a new opportunity to build on solid foundations it is evident that the state of the economy in what has to do with the macroeconomic fundamental factors is in good condition inflation is under control six months in advance so far this year it does not exceed  and if looks annualized  very close to the variation in prices are the interest rates of the banco de la republica which maintain their downward trend and have already fallen to  this data is important for this week as there is a meeting of the board of directors of the issuer and they will surely make the decision to encourage consumption with a new reduction there is a good supply of food in light of the consumer price index and the climate cycle is has regularized for several months the other data that is in good health is the one that has to do with the exchange rate the first semester of the year closes with a trm that averages   a figure that is good for exporters and acceptable for importers travelers and buyers of goods and services online this last factor is closely linked to the good price of oil that has made the dollar remain stable and in the process revitalize the national accounts and generate dynamics in the colombian stock exchange via ecopetrol which is the value role that drags the good or bad news from the secondary market other factors such as unemployment which is at  imports which have grown by  and exports which have risen by  are more closely linked to the weight of crude oil in the economy not everything is rosy the presidentelect receives deteriorated public finances many commitments acquired and some billionaire future terms already agreed there are commitments with multilateral banks and rating agencies to maintain the fiscal rule which must be strictly complied with to maintain investment grade however one of the biggest promises was to thin the state lower the deficit to levels that allow the new government to be more agile and much more efficient during the outgoing administration the size of the state grew in a harmful way with several national agencies and different government offices that contribute nothing to development or wellbeing but it is in the fight against tax evasion and corruption that take public money where the heart of the matter lies all this new script of an upright and wellintentioned incoming government will be what will mark the second semesterecopetrol announces the commerciality of the infantas oriente field in barrancabermeja through a statement ecopetrol as operating partner in the la cirainfantas collaboration contract declared the commerciality of the infantas oriente field located in the rural area of barrancabermeja santander this field is located  kilometers from the la cirainfantas field and very close to the barrancabermeja refinery which will make it possible to take advantage of synergies with these operating areas according to the oil company the discovery well infantas  reached its objective at the beginning of this year at an approximate depth of  meters with the presence of crude oil in a thickness of  meters in testing the well produced more than  barrels per day of a light  degree api oil for this year an early development plan was approved to drill  wells with which an initial incorporation of proven developed reserves is estimated of which ecopetrol would correspond to  next year a complementary development plan will be executed with a focus on primary recovery which includes the drilling of  additional wells in addition progress is being made in defining the development plan for the field with secondary recovery through water injection which will allow the incorporation of more reserves in the medium and long term it was in this area that the oil industry in colombia was born  years ago the la cirainfantas field located very close to the new discovery has significantly increased its production in the last  years from  barrels per day in  to  barrels per day todaythe sic fined bureau veritas colombia and tecnicontrol for irregularities in ecopetrols tender in a press release the superintendency of insutria and commerce indicated that it fined bureau veritas colombia and tecnicontrol for more than   million as well as their legal representatives because they simulated or pretended to be competing companies in the tender when in reality they acted in a coordinated and concerted manner for the benefit of the bureau veritas international group to which both companies belonged  the history of the tender dates back to  when the oil company began a contracting process for   million which had the purpose of hiring the consultancy for the evaluation and monitoring of hse performance for ecopetrol sa  that is supervision in the field health safety  environment hse  the super explained that its decision is based on elements such as emails expert opinions and even testimonials from employees in addition on page  of the sic resolution it is seen that the economic proposals of the offers of bureau veritas   and tecnicontrol   presented in the tender were very similar which facilitated that a of them in this case bureau veritas will keep the tender finally the sic stressed that the conduct investigated does not involve ecopetrol or any of its directorssuperintendency of industry and commerce sanctions bureau veritas companies the superintendency of industry and commerce sic imposed a sanction on the companies bureau veritas colombia and tecnicontrol both controlled by bureau veritas internacional which would have incurred in violation of free competition by participating in a tender with ecopetrol the superintendency after an investigation of several years determined that bureau veritas and tecnicontrol had pretended to compete in this bidding process when in reality they were not competing they were coordinating their offers explained the superintendent of industry and commerce pablo felipe robledo  by pretending that both companies were competing and presenting similar offers they altered the average award that is the average of the offers so it tended towards its proposal guaranteeing that bureau veritas colombia won the   million tender in fact the sic established that both companies which are known for proving compliance with the rules by the companies manipulated their offers in such a way that the one presented by one was the complement of the other this is an infringement of the rules of free competition so the superindustry imposed a fine on those two companies that in total amounts to   million and constitutes one of the highest fines that the sic has imposed on the last few years said robledo the sic announced that the penalty for bureau veritas colombia is   million and that of its legal representative renato macedo de catrib filho is   million likewise tecnicontrol must pay   million and its legal representative rene omar pedraza acuna   million the sic investigation began in  after the entity received a complaint stating that both companies had common interests as they belong to the same international firm and that their participation in the bidding before ecopetrol would have been coordinated to increase the chances of either of the two winning the contract the sic was able to establish the relationship between both companies through emails documents expert opinions and statements from the employees of the companies involved since although the process of purchasing the companies was carried out between  and  only until  officially documented the integration process the contrasts pablo felipe robledo superintendent of industry and commerce a paradox a company that certifies good business practices ends up violating free competition through these same evidentiary elements the sic determined that the companies coordinated the offers for the tender and that their legal representatives not only knew about the unfair competition practices but also participated and directed them it is worth mentioning that this decision has an appeal for reconsideration before the superintendent and that this will be studied if the companies involved decide to present it lr tried to communicate with the companies to find out if they will present the appeal and their version of events but at press time it was not possible what was the tender before ecopetrol the tender mentioned in this case is a call made by ecopetrol for the purpose of awarding a contract to transport oil in tank trucks at the time eight interested companies presented themselves to the process of which in the end five were enabled among them bureau veritas colombia which obtained the tender and tecnicontrol the superintendence of industry and commerce highlighted that the investigation into these unfair practices in the bidding process does not involve ecopetrol its employees or its managers nor does it imply sanctions on any of themthe rating agency standard  poors reaffirmed ecopetrols investment grade the colombian oil company ecopetrol sa reported that the risk rating agency standard  poors maintained its longterm international rating at bbb grade with a stable outlook and the individual credit rating standalone at bb  the rating agency highlighted in its report the solid financial results with credit metrics strengthened thanks to the discipline of capital and the efficiencies implemented according to an ecopetrol report standard  poors highlights the good performance of the refining and transportation segments highlighting the operating results of the cartagena refinery in its stabilization stage at the same time he recognized ecopetrols focus on increasing reserves with positive results in the  balanceecopetrol filed a complaint about the collective agreement with the ministry of labor through the relevant information portal of the financial superintendence the state company ecopetrol reported that today it filed the complaint of the collective labor agreement in force with the ministry of labor the announcement was made taking into account that the agreement expires on june  as it was signed in  for a period of four years and it is from it that the companys employees benefit in accordance with the provisions of the law the signatory parties to the collective labor agreement have the power to express their intention to modify it through their complaint and in the event of a list of petitions submitted by the unions ecopetrol and trade union organizations will have to start negotiating a new convention said the oil company the organization assured that the complaint filed aims to update the content of some articles so that they are in tune with the transformation and growth of the companyecopetrols board of directors authorizes the sale of  shares related article ecopetrol filed a complaint of the collective agreement with the ministry of labor the oil company ecopetrol sa unanimously authorized by its board of directors the administrator of the company hector manosalva to sell  shares of ecopetrol owned by it reported the company through a statement said operation was authorized by pursuant to the provisions of article  of the commercial code the information added currently ecopetrol is the largest company in colombia and is among the  largest oil companies in the world as well as being one of the four largest in the sector in latin americacolcap would rise to  points this semester according to analysts the good semester that has just ended for the colombian stock market and for colcap its main index will tend to extend according to financial analysts consulted by lr the colcap which today reaches  points after having started  with  units could rise to an average of  points according to what was indicated by the experts according to independent financial analyst andres moreno the indexs net assets have reached   trillion at the end of june which qualifies as a historic figure the good behavior of the stock exchange will continue for the second semester since the four species that mark it are up said moreno who highlighted the good behavior of the financial sector based on the fact that davivienda and bancolombia closed last week at highs historical  from davivienda corredores german cristancho research manager said that there are some factors that have been playing in favor of colombia such as the price of oil but he is emphatic in mentioning that for the second semester these impulses could be more among cristanchos reasons is that once a new government that favors tax cuts for companies is defined the economy is activated and his election improves the expectations of investors who no longer see electoral risk for his part diego franco director of franco group sa mentioned that the colombian market has everything to go up this semester and pointed out that once the political issue was overcome that the colcap could exceed  it is not surprising colombia among emerging latin american countries is the least deteriorated so the country also lends itself to being the recipient of foreign investments that will not want to reach the rest of the countries in the region for me colombia is where capital is injected  another of the second semester changes that could boost colcaps growth is the proposal to transform the investment regime of the national pension fund for territorial entities fonpet this is a proposal that if approved could lead fonpet administrators to be more active in the stock market to which could be added the proposal for the afps in which the new contributions to the mandatory pension of people under  years could be allocated in a large proportion to the higher risk profile which could also lead to the appetite for local stocks increasing and continuing to favor colcaps performance said cristancho for his part in addition to oil prices that have reached historic values for this semester some macroeconomic decisions in the country have favored and promises to boost economic growth and as a consequence add points to the colcap index among those mentioned by analysts is a higher growth of the loan portfolio the closing of external deficit gaps low interest rates from banks policies that could reduce taxes on companies and a lower intervention rate than activate the trade from casa de bolsa they mention that despite the fact that the colombian market is strong due to internal decisions it could be affected by some external factors which is why they mention that in this second semester it will depend on how emerging countries react and although colombia has a different performance than its peers the effect of the currency would also boost it moreno also emphasizes that point and said that although we already have political and economic stability internally improving the economy upwards there may be a correction in the united states stock market that impacts us as well as some emerging markets have seen corrections and they have devalued a lot in the stock market  the contrasts german cristancho manager of inv economic davivienda brokers there are many factors that drove the good performance of the stock market in the first semester plus others that will allow it to grow more diego franco director of franco group the colombian market has everything to go up in this semester that colcap can exceed  points will not be surprising  the analyst pointed out that if there is a fall from the outside the possibility of bancolombia and ecopetrol falling remains latent these two are almost  that determine where colcap is going if this happens the shares of grupo aval bancolombia ecopetrol avianca and exito would fall because they have an external component according to analysts the shares of the financial sector the oil sector and a recovery in the cement sector will mark the stock market this semester the projections for the main shares the analysts consulted by lr agree that a higher oil price for this second semester will be beneficial for ecopetrol however since the market takes this for granted it may not have a great impact on the its stock value which has a target price of   for its part the infrastructure and cement sectors could see a recovery for which a value of   is projected for grupo argos the target price for davivienda is   and for bancolombia it is  ecopetrol

evidenced in the honda group before the discovery felipe bayon president of ecopetrol indicated that it is satisfactory to add one more discovery in development of the exploration campaign that we carry out in colombian territory the presence of crude oil and an important gas potential in  opens up new possibilities in the middle magdalena valley basin and will allow us in the future to have new gas reserves in the center of the country said bayon the  well is operated by ecopetrol which has a  stake his partner is the company cpven which owns the remaining  it is satisfactory to add one more discovery in development of the exploration campaign that we carry out in the colombian territory the presence of crude oil and an important gas potential in  opens up new possibilities in the middle magdalena valley basin and will allow us in the future to have new gas reserves in the center of the country  said felipe bayon pardo president of ecopetrol the drilling works met environmental requirements with zero accidents and in complete harmony with the communities in the area the  well is located very close to ecopetrols transportation infrastructure which could facilitate its commercial production stagewithin the union council there is no consensus to propose the sale of ecopetrol sources from the union council assured that it has not yet been fully agreed to present a proposal to the elected president of the republic ivan duque on a possible sale of  of the shares that the nation has in ecopetrol the supposed union proposal indicated according to the media that it was done to eliminate the risk of depending on the income of a highprofitability product such as oil however according to the source who did not want to be identified it is only an individual proposal from one of the members of the union council that will hardly be discussed among the members of the council if there is room and everyone agrees vote he said this is the process that is always followed within the union where all proposals submitted by its associates are received and discussed on the other hand the president of fasecolda announced that he will present the proposal in the morning i wanted it to be from the trade union council but as it was leaked to the media it will be mine and of those who want to welcome it he said now the sale of ecopetrol is not a new proposal a few months ago the president of the colombian stock exchange juan pablo cordoba said that a viable option to improve the fiscal deficit of the national government which is largely generated by the pension gap is the sale of another  of ecopetrol however these types of proposals have been widely criticized due to the constant great benefits that the oil company provides for dividends according to accounts of the ministry of finance the central government would have received about  of gdp per year in oil income between  and  which is equivalent to about us   million   billion and that this year it could return to mean a large portion due to the efficiencies that the state company has implemented and the rise in commodity prices finally upon learning of the proposal the uso the main union of the oil company indicated that it would propose a general strike for the defense of the patrimony the most important left for colombiansfasecolda presented a proposal for the sale of the shares of ecopetrol del estado related article within the union council there is no consensus to propose the sale of ecopetrol after a document was leaked in some media supposedly awarded to the national union council in which a proposal is presented to the presidentelect ivan duque for the state to sell his participation in ecopetrol the president of fasecolda jorge humberto botero confirmed that this is his initiative and not that of the group of production unions i give this press conference not as president of the trade union council but as president of fasecolda the document that proposes the sale of the nations shares in ecopetrol to allocate those resources to the development of the countrys road infrastructure was a proposal by fasecolda to the guild council that was going to be discussed next week  assured botero the proposal also intends to warn about the need to guarantee the macroeconomic and fiscal stability of the country for which it emphasizes the importance of strengthening the countrys competitiveness and maintains that for this it is necessary to continue with the work of road infrastructure that the present government has been working on along these lines the document argues that an alternative to finance these projects is to free up resources from oil revenues and substitute assets from the public patrimony for others to impact national economic growth and therefore employment in a long cycle botero said  the document is based on the idea that this operation would eliminate the risk of depending on the income of a highly volatile product such as oil it should be remembered that according to the ministry of finance between  and  the national government would have received about  of gdp per year in oil income which is equivalent to about us   million   billion likewise it is estimated that for this year this income could represent a large part of the efficiencies generated by the state oil company for his part the president of the national association of businessmen of colombia andi bruce mac master expressed his disagreement with the proposal and clarified that he is not linked to it the proposal to sell ecopetrol that appears in the words of the national trade union council has not been debated and even less agreed in that organization it is also worth clarifying that i do not agree with the idea  said mac master proposalforsaleofecopetrolsharesproposal to sell ecopetrol assets is an initiative of fasecolda despite the fact that some media presented a proposal on behalf of the national trade union council where the presidentelect ivan duque is asked to sell the state shares within ecopetrol jorge humberto botero president of the federation of colombian insurers fasecolda  explained that the idea is solely his own botero clarified that he was presenting the document not as president of the trade union council but as a director of fasecolda and explained that what he seeks with this measure is to free up resources from the oil rent and substitute assets of the public patrimony for others to impact in a long cycle the national economic growth and therefore employment said the manager with the money raised botero proposed that road infrastructure projects continue to be financed to boost the countrys competitiveness likewise the document assures that there is a need to guarantee the macroeconomic and fiscal stability of the country which is why dependence on income from a highly volatile product such as oil must be reduced the document also proposes the creation of a fund since after the sale the resources from the dividends of the oil company would be lost i wanted it to be from the council union but as it was leaked to the media it will be mine and of those who want to welcome it said botero who assured that he hoped that the document that proposes the sale of the shares of the nation in ecopetrol would be discussed next week for his part the president of the national association of colombian entrepreneurs andi bruce mac master expressed his disagreement and clarified that he is not linked to the initiative the proposal has not been debated and less agreed in the organization it is also worth clarifying that i do not agree with the idea  he assuredthe untimely idea of the insurers the proposal of fasecolda a union that groups together insurance companies operating in the country to sell the shares that the state has in ecopetrol is inconvenient untimely and quite imprudent in light of the international economic situation the entry of a the new national government and of course due to the rise in the price of oil so far this year a situation that will surely continue for several more months although the idea had been presented as an official document of the trade union council an organization where all the unions of the local economy meet the president of the insurance companies former minister jorge humberto botero came forward clarifying that the idea only commits them a proposal from which the national association of entrepreneurs andi moved away which did not take long to express its disagreement opening a crack in the unified positions that business groups should have at this time of new air for the politics and economics insurers may be right that high oil prices are a compelling argument to sell the mixed company well since going out to offer ecopetrol with a barrel at less than us   would be a disaster it can also be based on the fact that saudi arabia will divest in  its stake in aramco the state owned by the largest oil producer or perhaps it is supported by more theoretical arguments such as the necessary disinvestment of the state in all sectors words that have been heard in all privatizations which incidentally have left colombians with a very bitter taste from the same cession of the province of panama for which a handful of dollars were received supposedly to build the railways obviously going through the exit of the shares of carbocol the electricity companies telecom many official banks and more recently isagen former minister botero says that there is a need to guarantee the macroeconomic and fiscal stability of the country and the importance of strengthening competitiveness for which it is necessary to continue with the road infrastructure that the present government has been working on it suggests that an alternative to finance these projects is to free up resources from oil revenues and substitute assets from the public patrimony for others to impact economic growth and therefore employment over a long cycle during the last electoral contest all the candidates ruled out selling more ecopetrol shares only gustavo petro agrees with the idea of former minister botero that the risk of depending on oil rents product of high volatility must be eliminated in his own words in financial practice there is no compelling reason or policy to sell ecopetrol especially if one takes into account that between  and  the national government received close to  of the annual gdp in oil income that is us   million   billion with the mini bonanza looming it is estimated that for this year income could represent a large part of the efficiencies generated by the state oil company someday in the future the colombian state will have to leave all its shares in industrial companies including the oil company but it is not the time to give the new president that hot potato of having to sell the goose that lays the golden eggs moodys reaffirmed ecopetrols investment grade

the colcap reached  points and has managed to stay in this range thanks to the good results of some actions such as bancolombia and davivienda which have touched alltime highs the volatility that has

returns according to bloomberg data so far in   companies do not show good behavior and some such as cemex latam holdings has fallen  to   the lowest value since it started trading the same occurs with the title of the bogota telecommunications company etb which has fallen  to   a value that is also the lowest in the history of its listing according to andres moreno a stock market analyst in the case of the cement company what has happened has a lot to do with the behavior of the sector all cement companies have been greatly affected and this is one of the sectors that has fallen the most this year here they have been affected by the scandals in infrastructure works and specifically cemex by the fines and problems of its executives for which the majority of shareholders who are funds have been selling their positions this year  in the case of etb experts point out that it is a problem that increases with the lack of liquidity no pension fund or foreigner buys the stock since it has a bad reputation for the high costs it enters into having to support four unions and being in such a competitive sector moreno said adding that another point that makes it losing appetite is that when they wanted to sell it the unions themselves did not allow this to happen and legal uncertainty is a constant problem in the case of this title the stock is  years old since it was listed at   and today it is trading at almost half so they do not expect a future rebound on the other hand among the outstanding actions is the ecopetrol title which thanks to the oil price continues to gain positions and has improved its return by  this is followed by the action of davivienda with an increase of  and those of bancolombia with  and  dollar lost   against the trm on the day in yesterdays

reported on factors that caused the lisama  well to spill ecopetrol gave the authorities a technical report on the critical factors that occurred and caused the outcrop of crude oil on a property located  meters from the lisama  well which registered the march  in the town of la fortuna municipality of san vicente de chucuri department of santander according to the entity there were four critical factors all of them necessary to cause the outcrop one of the first factors according to what ecopetrol made known through a statement was a reservoir with natural overpressure conditions  psi in november  when the well was intervened which was suspended to define its eventual reactivation or definitive abandonment a section of working pipe fell to the bottom of the well which caused the rupture of the blanking plug  a plug or barrier that prevents reservoir fluids from reaching the wellhead likewise the entity pointed out that the activities in which the material fell were carried out by a contractor ecopetrol filed a lawsuit against said company in the cundinamarca contentious administrative court the rupture or failure of the blanking plug produced an unforeseen influx which required for its control the injection of fluids at a pressure of  psi a measure that could generate the loss of mechanical integrity in the production lining of    affected by corrosion this situation was evidenced in a  diameter hole at a depth of  feet identified with the records and analyzes carried out after the event this would have been another determining factor finally the company pointed out that other aspects that would have had an influence would be the presence of a natural system of geological faults in that area called la salina which added to the other factors allowed the fluids from the well to migrate through said faults and surface on the surface  finally he pointed out that the fourth factor was the exposure time of the formations above the overpressure of the reservoir which contributed to the outcrop of fluids a mixture of water mud oil and gas in a field near the well on the other hand the oil company reported that on july   the technical and definitive abandonment of the lisama  well was completedcompanies from santander and antioquia have  of the bvc capitalization if the totality of species in the colombian stock exchange is analyzed distributed by territory bogota is the region that has the highest number of these since it has  a number that is equivalent to  of the total in the stock exchange however the same analysis by region shows that santander and antioquia are above the capital those that concentrate a greater percentage of the bvcs market capitalization which is   billion the case of santander the department with the highest percentage of market capitalization  compared to antioquia  and bogota  is explained by the fact that it has the ecopetrol species a company that has a market capitalization of   billion that is  of the bvcs total capitalization value juan david ballen director of investigations at casa de bolsa commented that in colombia there are many companies that are not listed on the stock market while the opposite is the case there are companies that have been delisting perhaps if there were other policies or a greater knowledge of the market this panorama could surely look different  this vision is shared by andres moreno a stock market analyst who pointed out that there are some departments with large economies in which companies are not listed for example the coast has a number of large firms only with the enlistment of reficar and olimpica would already be the region the expert pointed out that among other regions epm is one of the big ones that should be on the stock market just as he regrets the departure of bavaria what one wants is for the largest companies to be listed explained ballen when asked about the growth in bvc capitalization that for this year it achieves a capitalization figure similar to that of only one species on the new york stock exchange such as mcdonalds us   million moreno highlighted the fact that in the country there are only  issuers for about a million registered companies and that this occurs because these companies are not interested in being exposed to the disclosure of information that implies enlisting and added that they prefer to be familiar the contrasts andres moreno stock market analyst the companies do not enlist as they do not want to meet the requirements and expose themselves to the required disclosure of information they prefer to continue as family businesses  juan david ballen director of brokerage house research what one would like is for the largest companies to be listed on the stock market the bag can still grow a lot if you look for them to be enlisted  on the growth that the bvc can reach analysts agree that it still has a high margin without competing with brazil or mexico for the difference between the size of the economies the share held by the stock exchange the issuer of the bvc species has not issued a new share issue since it was registered the share reached its lowest in  years in number of people the concentration on ownership of the company is evident according to moreno  partners have more than  shares and own  of the company which affects the liquidity of the species the analyst pointed out that to get out of this circle of lack of liquidity a capitalization is needed through the issuance of sharesthe new president of esenttia has been with the company for  years after almost three decades  years holding other positions in esenttia a company that belongs to ecopetrol juan diego mejia was confirmed as president of this company the decision was made by the boards of directors both at esenttia and ecopetrol mejia served as designated president since the end of  and had previously held the positions of vice president of supply and vice president of operations among others in the years that he has been in charge of this function the now official president achieved the first expansion of the companys plant increasing production from  tons to  tons for  this company ranked  in the country among the best reputation to work for according to the great place to work and safety awards for three consecutive years i will continue to lead with the people and for the people to continue providing added value to our clients and stakeholders in general with our purpose of being responsible actors in the sustainable transformation of society said the new presidentapple is  times bigger than the general budget of the nation yesterday apple made history after surpassing the figure of us   in the value of its shares on the stock market during the day it became the first american company to reach us   trillion one million million in its market capitalization this figure allows it to exceed the general budget of the nation pgn of colombia this year by  times which reached around us   billion that amount of money would also allow apple to pay seven times colombias foreign debt whose value reached us   million in april and even beats the market capitalization of companies like ecopetrol the most valuable in colombia that is above the us   billion a number that the tech giant surpasses  times the trillion dollar goal not only makes apple one of the strongest companies in the united states but also shows better economic potential than most nations in the world so much so that if the company founded in  by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne were a country it would enter the top  of the economies with the highest gdps on the planet specifically apple would occupy the  position of that ranking in which its immediate pursuer would be the netherlands with a gdp of us   million meanwhile the ladder is led by the us china japan germany and the united kingdom whose gross domestic product reaches us   billion us   billion us   billion us   billion and us   trillion respectively according to data from the international monetary fund imf although its situation would be more remarkable if it were a country in the region as it would make up the top three of the strongest economies in latin america being surpassed only by brazil and mexico countries that occupy positions nine and  of the highest gdp in the world world with us   trillion and us   trillion respectively not even his two immediate pursuers in the region argentina and colombia would get close enough to him but on the contrary they would only narrowly approach apples trillion united between the gdp of both nations a total of us   billion is obtained as for colombias gdp which is worth us   million the total market capitalization handled by apple is capable of tripling it the second quarter was good the great moment of the technology was achieved thanks to its results for the second quarter of the year as they meant income of us   billion and net profits of us   billion in addition to an operating cash flow of us   billion  revenue figures were  higher than thomson reuters estimates which placed this item at us   million between april  and june  likewise the company reported that in the last three months iphone sales reached  million units worldwide while ipad and imac registered sales of  million and  million units  respectively however iphone sales did not exceed streetaccount estimates as said firm projected  million as a quarterly result despite this the company highlighted that its sales volume grew  between april and june in addition to that its earnings per share grew  and reached a value of us   in the sales section apple also highlighted that  of them were carried out outside the us the director of brand finance for latin america laurence newell highlighted that apples success is due to its understanding very well what people are looking for in both a mobile device and a digital platform factors that make up the two parts of the equation for the success of a technology company apple has been doing things very well but not only this year but for at least  years when it launched the iphone on the market he said the executive also mentioned that demand and market growth in the technology sector are increasing at a much higher rate than in other fields of the world economy so much so that currently the  most valuable brands in the world are linked to the sector technological the contrasts laurence newell director of brand finance for latin america apple has been doing things very well but not only this year but for at least  years when it launched the iphone on the market manuel puentes manager of mp group sas apples success is not only due to its products but also due to brand loyalty and its customers which maintain high demand for his part the manager of mp group sas manuel puentes stressed that apples success is not only due to its products but also due to brand and customer loyalty which keeps demand and profits high  he also highlighted that factors such as apples focus on a product like the iphone in addition to its boom in the global market were factors that contributed to reaching the goal of us   trillion before other companies the company continues to rise for the third quarter of  apples projections estimate that the companys revenues could reach us   billion in addition to us   million in other income and expenses and a gross margin amounting to   with these numbers the company hopes to maintain its streak of the last four quarters as revenues have grown by double digits in a row since then according to apple ceo tim cookecopetrol will release its quarterly results on tuesday august  in a statement published as relevant information ecopetrol reported that on tuesday august  after the markets close it will announce its financial results for the operation for the second quarter of the year the company also reported that on

above the company has enabled a series of telephone lines for calls from the united states and colombia which you can consult in the document attached to this note the announcement of the results the presentation and the webcast will be available on the ecopetrol website the specialists are waiting for ecopetrols financial results for the second quarter of the year the analysts consulted hope that the company will show its face for colcap due to a higher price of oil and after regular results from the companies that have been reported ultraserfinco expects it to achieve revenues of   billion an ebidta of   billion and net profits of   billion while davivienda corredores expects revenues of   billion ebidta of   billion and net profits of   billion for the companya new attack against the cano limon covenas oil pipeline was presented the staterun ecopetrol confirmed yesterday that a new attack was made against the cano limon covenas oil pipeline in the el consuelo village a rural area of the saravena municipality in the arauca department the event produced an oil spill in the vegetable layer and soil without affecting water sources and reached a section of a tertiary road that serves as an alternate access between saravena and the municipality of tame the company assured through of a statement this terrorist action forced the oil company to activate its contingency plan immediately the fact was known ecopetrol notified the municipal council of risk and disaster management of saravena and the corresponding environmental authoritiesecopetrols financial results would be positive in the second quarter this afternoon at the close of the market ecopetrol will announce its financial results for the second quarter of this year taking into account that between april and june the prices of a barrel of oil were around us   the expectation is that the oil company has had a good performance during the quarter for camilo thomas an analyst at alianza valores revenues will increase  compared to those obtained in the first quarter of the year however it estimates that net income will remain the same as for the first three months of the year due to the recovery in oil prices revenues will be close to   billion but the profit will remain at   billion we do not believe that it is probable that there will be such good margins as in the previous quarter he explained in addition to the price recovery the analyst argued the good expectations with the fact that there would be higher production than in the first quarter when public order events occurred the contrasts camilo thomas analyst at alianza valores the profit will remain at   trillion because we do not see as likely that such good margins will be given as those of the first quarter orlando santiago manager and analyst at fenix valor considers that on the contrary net income will be higher than that obtained between january and march reaching   trillion if in the first quarter with the average price of a barrel at   a profit of   trillion was achieved this quarter the profits will be higher since the average price of a barrel of wti in these three months was    he pointed for the manager of fenix valor the profit will also be higher because ecopetrol has carried out a strategy in which it reduces its costs distributes less profits and uses the surpluses in the payment of debt in addition it has focused its production on the most profitable wellstoday begins the negotiation of the list of requests that the uso made to ecopetrol starting today the  petitions that the petroleum industry workers union uso delivered to ecopetrol a few weeks ago and that would cost the oil company more than   billion will begin to be discussed regarding salaries the union is asking for a  increase with a further increase of  in six months in addition  would be added in economic benefits of those that union members have another request is to increase the daily rate for national travel expenses by  and international travel expenses by  which represents about us   per day this means that  annual air tickets are being requested for their leaders and delegates with round trips in addition they ask for a total of  travel days per year in addition to the  days they already have which is equivalent to  people traveling every day of the year for the transportation premium the union asks for a  increase for the first year and a  increase for the second year regarding health the uso asks to extend the benefit of this coverage to parents and dependent foster children up to the age of  it also includes payment for prepaid medicine and occupational health screenings for  contractors this area also includes the construction of a hospital in rubiales and health centers located in cartagena and villavicencio on the education side it is requested to pay the annual uniform fee of   for the first year of validity of the collective agreement and the second year to increase it by  in recreation the statement asks that the ecopetrol administration pay for the endowment operation and maintenance of workers clubs pensioners and a club for the union the economic aid requested by the uso exceeds   million as they seek to make use of these in the construction and remodeling of their headquarters and in the renovation and maintenance of their vehicles also that they pay for gasoline according to a uso statement the main axis of these requests is the defense of ecopetrol as public patrimonyecopetrol is not a christmas tree like private companies those of the state with all their institutions do not have inexhaustible budgets or rubber that are stretched and make use of scarce resources that must be well managed to favor the development of the country and guarantee wellbeing to the new generations the issue comes up because today the discussion of collective bargaining between unions and ecopetrol managers officially begins this has always been and will be a thorny issue for the tripartite forces that come together in this necessary episode for the company to continue its course without major obstacles the role played by the senior management of the joint venture the unions under the notarial view of the ministry of labor must be a guarantee of a country in progress that knows how to remove conflictive processes in the best way despite the distant positions at the time setting demands may dictate otherwise the colombia of the  century must have new values that move away from the conflict that has marked the fate of all discussions for several decades a couple of weeks ago the union sindical obrera presented its list of requests for the negotiation of the collective agreement that will be in force until the new government in  therein lies the importance of this stage of agreement in which the unions proposal asks for unattainable things that make negotiation difficult on the first negotiation front there is not much discussion since it is about the defense of the joint venture so that it does not privatize a point on which there is for now enough illustration since the new president ruled it out during the campaign and he moved away from the idea launched by the insurers union the second point to be negotiated has to do with the acquired rights of direct workers on which there are great differences because it is not possible to pretend to charge ecopetrol with those benefits to workers of outsourced companies according to the figures provided by the company it has  direct workers and  contractors to expand profits the company practically ceases to have viability and the option of privatizing or selling would begin to play on the future board the third point may be debatable but with several objections and it is the one that aims for the company to play a more decisive role in the territories not only to be a state company with influence in the oil regions and in the capital of the republic itself but have a national game which makes sense but this is not a country like venezuela where oil is the lifeblood of the economy we cannot intoxicate the economy again with an irreparable dutch disease there are also other less logical things such as forcing the company to buy back the shares of the share capitalization processes carried out in  and   of ecopetrols ownership be returned to the nature of industrial and commercial company of the state that is that ecopetrol is  stateowned and more leonine things like a   million bonus for signing the new collective bargaining agreement for each of the  workers affiliated with the union which in total would be more than   million and the most discriminatory thing that generates inequality salary increase of  with an additional increase of  in six months everything is part of the discussion that as a bird is worth about   billionthrough a list of requests uso seeks not to privatize ecopetrol the president of the union of workers of the petroleum industry uso cesar eduardo loza presented at a press conference the fundamental pillars of the list of requests that were delivered to ecopetrol which will begin to negotiate today at   in the morning the objective of the list of requests is to defend the public nature of the company we request that  of the shares be repurchased because we consider that a strategic line for the colombian economy such as oil should be in the power of the state he said according to the union the first of the three fundamental pillars of the statement is to improve the labor rights of direct employees and outsourced workers the latter make up  of the company and a couple of years ago their salary was reduced between  and  the second of the pillars is to guarantee the right to collective bargaining that is to union representation and that this can be carried out in the subsidiaries and collective companies the last of the pillars is to invest what is necessary to benefit the communities that are affected by the development of the oil activity we are also interested in caring for the environment and we propose that ecopetrol begin to study and investigate to generate alternative energies said loza it is worth mentioning that the union pointed out that its list of demands does not cost   billion as has been said but that with the negotiation it would be between   million and   million however they have not calculated the value of their requests both the uso and ecopetrol have expressed their desire for dialogue and it is expected that they will reach an agreement in this way in this regard the uso stated that it will exhaust all resources for dialogue before going on strikeecopetrol reported the highest ebitda margin in its history reaching  the state oil company ecopetrol presented its financial results for the first half of  in which it highlighted that the company delivered the highest ebitda margin in its history  for its part the oil companys ebitda for the first six months of the year stood at   trillion likewise the company delivered in its financial report a net profit of   billion for the first semester  above its earnings for the same period of  which stood at   billion on the other hand the companys operating profit was   trillion almost double the   trillion reported the previous year in addition the report highlighted that the oil company maintained its production for the second quarter of the year within the target range which is between  barrels per day boe and  boe average production for the quarter amounted to  barrels of oil equivalent per day  above the same period of the previous year and  more than in the first quarter of  said the president of the company felipe bayon who indicated that ecopetrol managed to recover from the operating effects of the first quarter thanks to the results of the drilling campaign in fields such as la cira rubiales cano sur dina quifa and castilla another aspect that the state oil company highlighted in its report was the  increase in refining as the cartagena refinery reficar closed the quarter with  boe while the barrancabermeja one reported  boe this allowed a stable loading of the system with  barrels per day to be achievedsocial search the fashionable method to meet job candidates when it comes to recruiting and selecting the ideal staff for a job position organizations use different methodologies in recent years with the rise of social networks and smartphones a method that has become popular is social search this consists of building a profile of the candidate for a job from the monitoring of their social networks so it is recommended that people be careful with their digital reputation and what they share according to daniel parra manager of permanent placement of the adecco group in colombia this method is a way to know the personalities of potential employees and determine how well they can be adjusted to the culture and organizational climate of the company the permanence of workers in organizations is increasingly relevant an indicator of human management is the decrease in turnover rates and an important component in addition to motivation and conditions is the empathy of the personality of the workers with the company the social search helps to validate the coherence between what is seen in a resume and the real life of people  he highlighted the profile is built by specialized consultants who take into account variables such as personal interests professionals and hobbiesecopetrols revenues amounted to   billion in the first semester once the market closed ecopetrol presented its results for the second quarter of this year according to these in the first semester the oil company had revenues of   billion  more than in the first half of    billion as for the net profit for the period between january and june this was   trillion which is  higher than that obtained in the first half of last year   trillion regarding the operating profit for the semester the company reported   billion a figure higher than the   billion registered in the first of  between april and june ecopetrol produced  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped compared to the  boed that were extracted in the same period of  and the  boed in the first quarter of the year this average is the highest in the last seven quarters we were able to take advantage of the favorable oil price environment and at the same time we reaffirmed our technical operational and financial capacity as well as our commitment to safe and environmentally responsible practices said the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon ebitda for the semester was   trillion ebitda margin of  while in the first half of  it was recorded at   trillion ebitda margin  the margin achieved in these six months is the highest for the oil company in its history according to an analysis carried out by the broker casa de bolsa the results are positive because at the end of the second quarter of  the brent crude oil reference registered a variation of  compared to the first quarter of the year and of   compared to the second quarter of  with this recovery in barrel prices grupo avals stock broker estimated that net profit would be   trillion this expectation was below the results for the quarter since the net profit between april and june reached   billion the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol ecopetrol continues to focus on operational excellence the generation of value and a commitment to ethics and transparency diego franco president of franco group the good results are due to the recovery of barrel prices and the cost reduction program of the oil company between january and june ecopetrol dispatched  boed which corresponded to local sales while  boed were sold abroad total sales volume was  boed lower than the total sold in the first half of   boed the decrease in local sales is explained by lower domestic sales of crude oil to be directed to refineries and by lower gasoline sales due to the increase in the amount of ethanol in gasoline which went from  to  in march as for the decline in the international market this is explained by lower availability of crude oil for export and the increase in diesel exportssix out of  companies recruit through headhunting organizations it is increasingly common for large companies to fill their vacancies through a headhunting firm and the data shows it according to the english company michael page  of the national and multinational companies operating in the country recruit their employees for middle and highranking positions by this means related article request for managerial profiles in headhunting firms reaches  this is how in the last  years headhunting companies have become the main allies of large companies such as ecopetrol bp corona alpina colombina condimentos el rey volkswagen  among other the work of these organizations is so effective and colombian talent is so sought after that many foreign recruitment companies decided to enter the local market to compete for example hays is a company of british origin with more than  years of experience worldwide which arrived in colombia in  and only last year filled  vacancies in sectors such as manufacturing telecommunications mass consumption engineering insurance and other competitive sectors in its seven years of presence in colombia this multinational successfully located  people in these same sectors related article headhunters seek leadership and planning ramiro bado director of hays colombia explained that colombian talent is increasingly striking and competitive although it still lacks a bit the colombian professional has potential but he must improve in matters that more and more professionals have a second language this is a priority for multinationals  the contrasts ramiro bado director at hays colombia the colombian professional has potential but must improve on issues such as having a second language a priority for multinationals carlos guillermo lopez general manager of lhr for us colombia is the paradise of talent because we find very competent people who are committed to their work although companies outsource the search for talent that does not mean that the levels of demand are low in fact the task is delegated to firms so specialized in a sector or in certain positions that the preparation of job candidates is complex and only professionals with the best profiles pass bado pointed out that it is important to prepare a profile in which a specialization stands out since this gives support to their expertise in a certain labor field according to the companies consulted in the  salary guide this factor is a priority temporary positions there are also different companies that are not only in charge of generating connections for direct jobs but also serving as temporary positions for their client companies as is the case of the swiss company adecco this company is in more than  countries and has connected more than  people and  of its clients around the world per day in colombia they have  branches in  cities from which they look for talent for approximately  national and multinational companies another of the main headhunting companies in colombia is michael page which operates in  countries and located more than  professionals in the labor market in  according to beltran benjumea managing director of pagegroup colombia which registers global growth of  compared to  and  national international firms are not the only ones in this market an example is lhr latin_american human resources a colombian company focused on the oil and gas sector which has been linking colombian talent with multinationals that have a global presence for  years working especially in saudi arabia carlos guillermo lopez general manager of lhr assured that the countrys talent is very competent and does not compare with that of other countries for us colombia is a talent paradise because we find very competent people who are committed to their work this headhunting company has agreements with oil companies such as ecopetrol saudi aramco savic acnoc and bp with which it is in charge of finding the best professionals they began in  linking four people or families as they prefer to call them with oil companies in saudi arabia last year they managed to successfully carry out approximately  processes and this year they hope to close it with  successful processes in addition in their  years of experience they have exported latin american talent linking  families in positions at all levels for these oil multinationals but beyond finding and bringing talent lopez believes that it is very important to guide companies in order to build their employer brand with the truth of what they can offer their new collaborators recommendations when starting your job search keep in mind that you must make an exhaustive analysis of the sectors and companies to which you want to apply as this will save you a lot of time and focus on finding out which is the best headhunting company for achieve your career goals in colombia you will find firms such as lhr which focuses on the oil and gas sector worldwide executive search group and key executives rates which are intended to fill executive vacancies hays who have a greater breadth in their positions and sectors people solutions which bases executives for the economic sector or the alfa firm which focuses on recruiting engineers among others what is sought beyond studies related article linkedin is not a competition or a threat from headhunting firms studies and specializations are very important when applying for a vacancy in any company but those are not the the only variables that large companies look at when looking for their strategic talent it is essential to have and develop skills to manage and lead groups correctly likewise many companies look at the profile of their potential employees for other skills such as the potential in matters of creativity and innovation that generate added value to the company and that differentiate the candidate from the rest of the people who also apply for the same vacancyecopetrol and exito among those that sold the most at the end of the second semester this week the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon pointed out that due to the new explorations projects obtained abroad and a barrel price above us   the company achieved revenues in the first half of the year of   billion that was reflected in a  increase

consumption that has felt the decrease in the interest rates of the banco de la republica in the last  months by  basis points the sura group is the third with the highest income in the semester after its sales reached   billion the company explained in its report that in addition to ordinary consumption there is a reactivation in the capital market there the increase in profits although it was at levels below double digits exactly  reflects the effect of strategic decisions and the volatility of financial markets his report details these profits a year ago closed in june at   million and in

million  grupo argos closes the top five with a slight increase of  in its revenues which as of june ended at   billion however what did grow and by  was the profit which went from   million to

concept of the carulla brand he said he also spoke of the cash and carry format in which today they have  surtimayorista stores and will end the second semester with eight new of those stores there were several points in which the reason for the good results between january and june is divided in addition to the operating profit of colombia there is a good performance in the growth of ebitda for

expected to take about a year on the other hand the minister of mines and energy maria fernanda suarez said that electricaribes rates will not increase in the long term we will look for an efficient operator that has muscle said the official who said that the first thing she did was meet with the governors in search of a structural solution the process that is underway will give us information due to the appetite that exists for the electricaribe asset he saidthe ministry of mines and energy plans to study the viability of fracking despite the fact that from many sectors it is requested that colombia not focus solely on hydrocarbons to grow economically the minister of mines and energy maria fernanda suarez told businessmen that they must work to continue being the main engine of the economy and given the concerns about whether the country will endorse francking he pointed out that a decision will be made after conducting a responsible study with the environment to set the parameters together and thus reach a conclusion businessmen from the sector stated that in the magdalena there are millions of barrels that can be obtained with this technology and that for this reason to dispel the concerns of some groups a responsible pilot plan with water and with the regions can be carried out if there is potential it can be done responsibly because that is taking control of destiny we must take care of the environment but betting on the development of our resources to prosper  said in the panel environment for business competitiveness the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon likewise suarez asked the businessmen to have a permanent dialogue with the communities and mentioned that they are expectant about the ruling of the courts on the prior consultations that are under review in addition he said that there must be greater clarity and a law of concertation could be createdecopetrol announced that it will venture into solar energy projects in meta during andis national assembly ecopetrol president felipe bayon announced that as part of the companys plan to strengthen the development of renewable energy projects and diversify its energy portfolio the company will begin construction next year of a solar park in the municipality of castilla la nueva in meta according to the manager the project will be in charge of supplying the castilla field the second largest in the country bayon announced that the initiative will have  hectares and an installed capacity of between  and  mw enough to supply the consumption of approximately  homes the incursion into largescale solar energy projects marks a milestone in the history of ecopetrol which is added to other developments to have a more diversified and clean energy matrix which contributes to protecting the environment and ensuring energy security of colombia said the president of the oil company the solar park joins other nonconventional projects in which the company has been working such as the production of biofuels from sugar cane in barrancabermeja and puerto lopez in meta likewise ecopetrol has been working on exploration and natural gas work as a greener line of work the commitment to renewable energies would make the ecopetrol group one of the main solar energy generators in the country emphasized bayon who assured that through this solar park it will be possible to avoid the annual emission of around  tons of carbon dioxide carbon equivalent to  tons in  years another point highlighted by the executive is the benefit that the reduction in electricity costs in the field will bring to the communities as well as the reduction in emissions that will be equivalent to planting  trees per year on the other hand bayon also announced that in the last quarter of the year the competitive process for the project will be carried out so that companies with experience in similar projects will participate the project is expected to start in the first three months of  and that once it is awarded and its commercial viability is assured it is estimated that the works will take a maximum of one yearwe can end the year with a selfsufficiency of more than six years velandia  began with a recovery in oil prices which generated great expectations in the industry in the country as it could generate a reactivation of the sector and improve the figures in terms of production and resources for the country in an interview with colprensa the president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh orlando velandia takes stock of the sector in the first half of the year the expectations at the end of  and the changes in contracting for exploration among others themes what is the balance of the sector during this first half of the year and the projections at the end thanks to the prices that crude oil has maintained in this first semester and the actions that we have been taking in recent years we already have clear signs of recovery in the sector not only in terms of production exploratory activity in the mobilization of drills in search of new resources but also to develop existing fields these reactivation indicators are the result of a better price level and a stabilization that is an important factor because it is not enough for the price to rise but to stabilize because that is what allows companies to do their planning of investment in addition we have carried out activities to give contractual signals that allow us to have a better scenario and a more encouraging future in the oil industry what are the expectations at the end of  although there are some concerns about demand levels where there may be a worldwide reduction that could generate a drop in prices we do not believe that in the short term there will be a significant reduction in prices which would allow us that at the end of the year in this second semester we not only have a level above  barrels of daily production approaching  but also that this price level will facilitate that in the projections of royalty collection which are very important for the regions we can have goals met and a reactivation of social investment in the country from many fronts there is already talk of a reactivation of the sector what are those signs that lead you to think this a driving factor in this industry is seeing contractual and institutional signals to facilitate operations and for price levels to remain stable the best response to those signals is that companies are mobilizing their drills to operate either to go short or to find new reserves what are the expectations for exploration after having critical figures in  where we only explored  wells last year we were able to drill  and our goal for this year is to exceed this figure we have to bear in mind that a large part of these exploratory commitments are made in the second half of the year during the dry season of the year and in some regions we will have to wait for the rains to stop before entering the field and setting up the drills so far we have  wells so far this year and that is why we hope that in this second semester we will be exceeding  that we did in  because we can have greater industry activity in the regions with this expectation of recovery the anh has announced changes in hiring one of them is the modification to offshore contracting what does it consist of we had signed technical evaluation contracts with several of the companies in the colombian caribbean sea which are already reaching their final part and the companies have options of converting to exploration and production contracts that is allowing them to undertake the drilling of wells and search for hydrocarbons in those areas but the contractual conditions that we had in colombia were not being well seen by many of those companies because we were not competitive in the contractual terms in relation to other countries such as mexico brazil argentina and canada itself in this way we needed to make an adjustment and a thorough revision to those contractual terms and put ourselves at the forefront of those countries in competitive matters we made this adjustment and a little over a month ago we promulgated the new offshore contractual bill which in the opinion of many experts places us on a par with several countries in the region and has been well received by the industry in fact we have already been notified by the companies of their intention to switch to exploration and production contracts which will allow us to search for these hydrocarbons and if possible start producing what expectations do you have for the future with this change in hiring what we can begin to do is convert all those areas that were in technical evaluation contracts and turn them into exploration and production contracts which allows us to give an enormous reactivation to all oil activity in the caribbean sea in fact an element that has also been vital for this interest of the companies is the discovery of four wells in the caribbean sea and that also calls the interest of the companies but we had to adjust those contractual terms and not miss the opportunities that we had  many people have been skeptical of this type of exploration in the caribbean sea should colombia continue betting on this type of exploration the recent discoveries of  and  show us that we have very prospective areas that we have a basin where we can not only find gas but also liquid hydrocarbons the companies have understood this and have evaluated the models of the petrological systems that we have proposed in the anh which were corroborated in discoveries by companies that are major players in the world and have expressed their great interest the best indicator of this is that in the time of oil recession in the world where in no basin they were making investments they were only made in the colombian caribbean sea and we could have a development in    which means that companies believe in the future of the hydrocarbon industry in the countrys caribbean and what we need from the government is to create the conditions to have that investment how many blocks does the entity expect to award this year we have in the conversion of nine blocks which cover an area of almost  of our maritime territory and that allows us to have a very important coverage in exploratory matters but we are also thinking about the next processes of allocation adjudication and going out to offer new areas in the caribbean sea of the country there were high expectations with the sinusan jacinto basin what was this issue we advanced the process and at that juncture of promulgating the regulations the companies asked us to be more precise in legal aspects and asked us to suspend the process until they did not have those details of a legal nature that were suddenly not very clear we already made the adjustments a few weeks ago and what we have is to sit down with the companies that are authorized to reactivate the process and see what their future is from the allocation of those  blocks the anh announced that they will opt for the permanent assignment how is this going to work the permanent allocation process was approved a few weeks ago by the board of directors and it is the rule of the game for how to allocate areas in colombia this is the general allocation mechanism and it will be carried out through the permanent competitive process that has already been regulated and in which the companies began to express their interest the new general rule is that in this process the anh will be permanently offering blocks and each time a company makes an offer for an area it begins as a small mini round for that area then we receive the offer we advertise to new companies that want to be interested and we are doing that continuously because every month or every two months we will be updating the map of areas seeking the greatest benefit for the country how many areas will be offered under this allocation in this process we already have  areas ready which are the ones that we are going to offer at the next board of directors and what we want is to receive approval and place them on the area map but the mechanisms established by the terms of reference also contemplate the possibility that companies can submit requests for specific areas where they have an interest not necessarily those offered by the anh what are the requirements that companies will have to meet now to apply the companies have to be uptodate and the areas are now going to be classified by a points system and depending on the classification qualification requirements will be demanded especially financial and technical capacity specifically for each type of area that is the company is not enabled to participate in a process such as in the rounds but now they have to have specific capabilities depending on the type of area because a contract entered into in a mature area where there is already a knowledge of prospectivity that an area that is a border basin whose information is very basic and that is why the same type of capital investment should not be required faced with the issue of fracking a project to prohibit this activity in colombia is being studied what opinion do you have from the agency it seems to us that this debate must be done when it takes place in congress on the stage of the discussion of the project and there we will be presenting our arguments as a government we are reading the arguments of the bill and in due course we will make our clarifications on our reading of this issue what we consider in the anh is that what we should think first is to overcome the stage we are in to know what our real potentials are many sectors are thinking of prohibiting an activity through this bill without having a greater knowledge of the potential elements but the technical discussions of fears and arguments we want to outline in the discussions that take place which at the time we would like that were as technically and scientifically as possible how far has the fracking issue advanced in the country we are in an exploratory phase until now and without knowing what the potential of the resources is so we do not dare to say how much the figures are but we believe from a preliminary and geological point of view that colombia has significant potentials and that it is necessary to a judicious analysis of social technical financial and environmental benefits should be thought about once the conclusions of that first evaluation are obtained if we were to consider that resources are extractable and necessary it will always be done with the highest environmental and technical standards but we have to emphasize that we are still in a very preliminary phase of the process and so far we are exploring whether there are resources and what are the conditions we currently have seven contracts signed in the exploratory phase which given the environmental circumstances we are waiting to continue advancing in each of the processes to find out our real potential in this area how much are the countrys oil reserves i think that the good news that we were able to give the country at the beginning of this year is that for the first time after several years we had a reserve replenishment factor higher than  since last year we reached a factor of  in other words of the resources that we consume from the reserves how many were we able to replace by optimization of deposits by new discoveries improvement of recovery factors among others we had been in for two years  and  with negative factors due to the crisis of falling prices and there were no new discoveries there was no exploratory activity because we were in a worldwide recession and in colombia we were not immune to that we began to make efforts since  that could materialize last year with a recovery factor of  barrels that is we replaced  more barrels than we had to replace how can this year end i believe that we can end with a selfsufficiency horizon of more than six years thanks to the price level and the optimization that we are doing in the fields with this outlook how many resources can this sector leave to the country for royalties we believe that we are going to end the year above  trillion pesos that is almost  more than last year this is a very important figure because in  we were in the order of  billion and that is why i believe that due to current conditions we can exceed this figure considerably at a level very close to what we had in  which was a time very good for production and prices how is the country on gas our level of selfsufficiency is over  years old and there are companies that continue to bet on gas and many have already reported some findings this year so we have peace of mind on this issue however the government has considered that it is necessary to continue taking important insurance and that is why it is talking about the pacific regasification plant as a measure to guarantee the industry that it has a gas supply our responsibility as anh is to continue encouraging exploration activity and gas production in new discoveries and what is being carried outecopetrol alpina etb and celsia profit rose more than  in the first half related article ecopetrol and exito among the top sellers at the end of the second semester the week begins with the balance of the financial results of  companies which have delivered their figures for the first semester among the data that attracts the most attention are the four companies that reported profits with growth of more than  when compared with the period from january to june  the first case is that of ecopetrol which after registering profits of   billion in the first half of  the figure grew  in the same period this year closing at   trillion the highest variation on the list the president of the company felipe bayon pointed out that this is due to the fact that the average production of the quarter amounted to  barrels of oil equivalent per day  above the same period of the previous year and  more than in the first quarter of   similarly another outstanding fact was that it achieved the highest ebitda margin in its history reaching  with   billion the second company with the highest growth in profit was alpina which rose  going from   million in the first half of  to   million between january and june of this year the report delivered by the president of the firm ernesto fajardo detailed that this result was the product of new investments for   million to generate more production possibilities in addition to that its ebitda went from  to  to close at   million the results of the first semester reflect the effort to increase productivity and guarantee its profitable and sustainable growth in the future said fajardo the third case is one of those that most attracted the attention of the commission agents and the telecommunications sector since it is etb which after four years finally returned to generate profits it presented an improvement in its profits of  after a year ago the losses for the semester were   million a figure that is now positive and amounts to   million part of the favorable result as highlighted in the june report is that fiber optic users have an average growth of  in two and a half years to date there are  of these clients the above added to the growth of television and mobile telephony users at levels of  and  respectively intervened to generate profits despite the fact that revenues fell  in the first half finally in the energy sector celsia was another of the four companies that showed profits above  exactly it rose  with a net profit between january and june of   million after coming last year with a figure of   million in addition its revenues increased  thus being the tenth with the highest sales of the semester going from   billion in the first half of  to   billion the group attributes part of the progress to various projects such as the start of operations in two of the seven  projects the expansion works of the valledupar substation and the startup of its first photovoltaic project in costa rica with the installation of solar panels at compania de galletas pozueloecopetrol will concentrate resources on drilling for the rest of the year felipe bayon

markets today the celebration of the company comes at a time when it is the ninth with the best market capitalization among latinas listed on us exchanges with a capitalization of   billion after

businesses such as biofuels and petrochemicals modernize its refining and transportation infrastructure become a business group with operations in colombia the united states brazil mexico and peru and contribute more than   billion to the nation between royalties taxes and dividends  the ten years of the company on the american stock market can be narrated in numerical data at the end of  the firm had  institutional investors with adrs american depositary receipts or securities of shares abroad while in the first half of this year they reached  in the last quarter of  the daily volume adr traded was approximately  compared to the second quarter of this year when the average volume traded was around  in addition adrs in circulation at the end of  were  while for the second quarter of  they reached  the bonanza due to the rise in oil prices that has been seen since april has also caused the value of the companys share on the new york stock market to rise  in  julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of engineers de petroleo acipet mentioned that the company has historically been fundamental to the economic development of the country and stressed that having listed on the stock market both locally and subsequently internationally is the greatest historical change that the company has had since it has allowed it to have the budgets operability and efficiency to behave on a par with any international oil company the contrasts mario acosta manager of strategy and economic research at ultraserfinco the manager of strategy and economic research at ultraserfinco mario acosta praised the development that the oil company has had in the international stock market commenting that it is an achievement that many companies do not reach that puts it at the level of the greats of the region  in his analysis acosta highlighted that there are also few companies with adr programs and that in terms of benefits this gives access to a greater number of investors such as those who invest only in dollars or those who do not have the possibility or intention to invest in the local stock market  all of this makes us feel proud to have been on the new york stock exchange for the first ten years said bayon the company will concentrate resources on drilling during the rest of the year ceo in the framework of the commemoration the reuters news agency

in an interview on the new york stock exchange on friday we are trying to make it happen this year it has to fit with the strategy and the right valuation bayon said mexico and brazil are definitely two of the key places we want to be through exploration or through acquisitions the company is focused on expanding its presence in the us possibly by joining forces with a partner he said analysts see the level of oil reserves as a challenge for the colombian driller crude is colombias biggest export but the country had reserves equivalent to just over five years of production at the end of last year that compares with more than  years for ecuador and nearly four centuries for venezuela according to bps statistical reviewecopetrol is eighth in dividends in the region according to the janus henderson index related article ecopetrol analyzes acquisitions this year to boost its reserves latin america had a large presence in janus hendersons global dividend report for the second quarter in addition to including  companies from countries such as brazil mexico chile argentina and colombia it pointed to ecopetrol as one of the  most prominent companies in the region ranking eighth at the same time she was the only colombian who was present in the analysis the dean of economics of the universidad del rosario carlos sepulveda highlighted that ecopetrols presence is positive for the country and these results reflect a good performance of the company thanks to the adjustment that the company has been making in recent years  for his part the coordinator of the government program of the externado de colombia university rafael pineros stated that ecopetrol is part of the group of colombian companies considered as multilatinas a factor that increases its strategic importance in the economic sector to which it belongs this characteristic gives an important influence to the company while colombia and argentina only had one company in the report brazil was the country that registered the most companies with a total of  it was followed by mexico and chile with seven and five companies respectively regarding the total amount of dividends from the latin american countries registered by janus henderson colombia was the third country with the highest figure yielding us   million surpassed only by mexico with us   million and chile with us   million as for brazil and peru each had us   million the five nations in the region were included as emerging markets in the analysis janus hendersons head of the global income team ben lofthouse highlighted dividends in brazil which have been a little stronger after a period of weakness adding that brazil and chile are the only two countries with companies in the top  global index that have recently paid dividends the contrasts carlos sepulveda dean of economics at the universidad del rosario the good moment for ecopetrol goes beyond oil prices as it made a strong restructuring shock plan ben lofthouse head of janus hendersons global income team dividends from emerging markets are quite volatile so we cant draw any conclusions from a quarter in terms of global performance total dividends for the second quarter reached us   billion with a growth of  compared to the same period last year of that total europe was the one that contributed the largest amount excluding the united kingdom with us   billion it was followed by north america with us   billion asia pacific with us   billion excluding japan which obtained us   billion last were the united kingdom with us   billion and emerging markets with us   billion the one that grew the most compared to  was asia pacific with the six shares of the stock market that have been at maximum prices this year so far this year a representative percentage of colcaps shares have seen different realities while six of the top  stocks on the colombian stock exchange have touched their best historical appreciations seven of them are close to or have already touched the minimum value since their start of operations this means that  of colcap shares could be going through their worst moment while  of them reach values that represent historical milestones in the stock market for their companies among those that have seen the best results ecopetrol stands out which although it is not at historical maximums this week it reached a price that was not touched four years ago the oil companys share did not exceed   since september  when the discovery of hydrocarbons in the leon well in the gulf of mexico was announced with ecopetrols  stake at that time the species reached a price of   compared to   that it achieves today a figure that is still important since the species represents  of the colcap basket carlos rodriguez director of variable income at ultraserfinco analyzed the current situation of ecopetrol commenting that the effort made in previous quarters is being seen because as a result of the collapse in international oil prices he entered into a process of efficiencies which today accompanied by crude oil prices it generates these good results for the company the leading companies in the financial sector have had an idyllic year if bancolombia shares are reviewed their ordinary species reached   on july  their historical maximum price while his preferred species did the same in the month until reaching   which is also its alltime high daviviendas preferential has also had a good year reaching its historical maximum at the end of may of   in anticipation of the markets expectations for its results in the first quarter rodriguez highlighted against the achievements of the finance companies that  for the banks was very complex in terms of portfolio deterioration and an increase in provisions while the catalyst for the current behavior has been the recovery of the economy the good news has also reached isa and geb according to the stock market analyst andres moreno the isa is due to an excellent balance sheet with a very good dividend and an increase in equity value so the company reached its alltime high in april the contrasts andres moreno stock market analyst the restructuring of ecopetrol in the crisis the management of austerity and savings issues added to the rise in oil prices make it perform well carlos rodriguez director of equities at ultraserfinco the most negative behavior so far in  has to do with assets related to the construction sector we have seen a decline in the sectors gdp  now among the stocks that are approaching their minimum limits those in the construction and cement sectors stand out see graph the construction sector has been affected by investigations and fines that have affected various companies said rodriguez on the part of the shares of el condor enka and fabricato their decline is due to lack of liquidity because they are so small explained moreno the one that most recently hit the lowest was the conconcreto share which fell  on monday driven by a report from the comptrollers office on problems in the construction of the hidroituango dam in which the firm participates in the construction

the local currency did not feel the same impact as the other emerging markets in the region since the colombian peso has differentiating elements such as the rise in oil which makes its fall not so pronounced juan david ballen director of research at casa de bolsa pointed out that as long as oil prices continue to be high the local currency will continue to resist the impacts that the rest of emerging markets in the region do not receive so well diego camacho director of research at ultraserfinco referred to this same regard noting that being an emerging nation it is undeniable that with the falls we are going to be affected so that issues such as the resignation of the director of the central bank of turkey or the new economic crisis in argentina with whom we do not have a close commercial relationship hits colombia just for sharing the title of emerging  now the analyst added that colombia has some peculiarities that put it in a better outlook such as oil prices plus some good economic data so that although we are emerging we have a different position from the rest and from colombia itself from previous years  according to analysts consulted by lr for september the normalization of the monetary policy of the us and europe will be decisive to define the behavior by the end of the year meanwhile a forecast by casa de bolsa pointed out that the turkish crisis generated by the lack of independence of the central bank will impact the local price increasing volatility in september in light of the above analysts consulted by lr expect the dollar to be between   and   on average during the month with an average volatility of   wilson tovar head of research at stocks and securities said that what is becoming evident is a somewhat complex situation for emerging markets with countries in which the situation is worsening as in the case of argentina which had to raise its rates interest at  showing the seriousness of the situation now that the exchange rate has doubled in one year  tovar pointed out that despite this the volatility of the colombian peso against global events is very small because we will have a range of almost   of volatility for the year which is very little compared to the events that have occurred with emerging companies  shielded by high oil prices  the contrasts juan david ballen director of research at the brokerage firm high oil keeps the colombian market with the armor it has seen in the year being impacted by the fall of emerging markets but not at the same level diego camacho director of research at ultraserfinco although we are emerging we have a very different position from the rest and from that of colombia itself in previous years we get infected by being from the same group  and precisely the crude prices

attended the workshop that the company continue to generate support for its workers and shareholders we want to strengthen the company that ecopetrol continues to generate that mystique in its workers and that it continues to generate in all its shareholders obviously the state as its majority shareholder and in those hundreds of thousands of colombians who have shares that continue to be

ecopetrols share reached a maximum of   during this mornings operations achieving intraday growth of  and a rise of  in the last  months what we see is that it is linked to the behavior of oil that is rising more than  in the case of brent that is trading above us   and the wti earns more than a dollar reaching above us   said roberto paniagua equity analyst at casa de bolsa the expert commented that this is a fairly relevant positive behavior as this can give colcap stability since the other shares are a bit quiet the last time the stock of the oil company closed at this amount was on april

we see is that it is linked to the behavior of oil which rose more than  in the case of brent trading above us   while wti gained more than a dollar and reached about us   said roberto paniagua  equity analyst at casa de bolsa the expert added that this is a fairly relevant positive behavior as this can give colcap stability since the other shares are a bit quiet from ultraserfinco carlos rodriguez director of variable income commented that these numbers are not only the result of the rise in oil since this is a mixture of the rise in prices with the profitability that the company has managed to maintain the analyst pointed out that since the  crisis ecopetrol has become a company that generates higher returns until it is strong even with oil below us   the contrasts roberto paniagua brokerage house equity analyst the rise of ecopetrol is a fairly relevant positive behavior as this can give colcap stability since the other shares are a bit quiet carlos rodriguez director of variable income at ultraserfinco what has supported colcap in the last  months has been the results of ecopetrol what has been neutral and positive about the index is thanks to the oil company marcela ramirez equity analyst at actions  valores pointed out that if oil prices do not have a significant devaluation the share does not have to return in the short term in addition to good corporate results which were above of the expectations in the previous two deliveries  what the market will be pending now ramirez points out is the extension of the life of the companys reserves because while the sector has an average of  years ecopetrol has  years and it is expected that with higher oil the company improves its reserve replacement rate which for last year was  that is not only did they replace reserves but also increase them an effect that is expected to be similar this year  the brent closed the day with a price of us   per barreletb cemargos and cemex are the shares that are at historical minimum prices investors in companies such as etb cementos argos and cemex see the dream of returning their shares to record highs when prices were at     and   respectively this year the titles of the companies have fallen to historical lows generating almost a loss of up to  from its highest price achieved for example in  when a cemargos share cost   and today it is trading at   according to the market close yesterday and it is that a low performance in certain sectors fines and indebtedness for investments are some of the causes of the decline in the shares of these entities as carlos rodriguez ultraserfincos director of equities explained these shares that have had the worst performance so far in  are related to the construction sector thus some reasons that have influenced this behavior are the weak fundamentals of the sector during the first half of the year and a sector that has been immersed in investigations and scandals  now for the analyst despite the fall currently prices are at very attractive values based on a recovery in the construction sector in  looking at the specific causes for each of the shares cemex as reported by natalia granados senior analyst at global securities was one of the hardest hit since so far this year it broke the level for the first time in history   down and is at a minimum among the reasons for this drop is the fine imposed at the beginning of the year by the superintendency of industry and commerce on the cement cartel which generated noise about the conduct of the cement company  etb for its part had a particular behavior for shareholders since although it presented green profits during the second quarter of this year the market continued with a downward price events such as the indebtedness for fiber optic projects from which they have not managed to generate profitability has caused the stock to fall to levels of   with a drop of  compared to its maximum price that was   on april   but in this case what could shareholders do marcela ramirez equity analyst at actions  valores stated that the recommendation for these shares remains limited to the extent that we consider that future announcements regarding any of the aforementioned issues could continue to generate significant depreciations therefore the initial advice of the analysts is to wait for the situation of each of the entities to stabilize or to be defined in the case of fines to be able to make a decision on the future of the prices of the securities related article spending control and more products boost etb jorge castellanos raul moreno stock analyst at casa de bolsa added in this regard that the entity maintains caution against cemex and conconcreto because they are companies that have problems with government entities however with cemargos we maintain a better perspective because participation in the united states has been increasing and although there is poor performance in colombia this is compensated by the activities in the northern country  of etb on the other hand if there is not a good perspective among the specialists since until the decision to sell or not is defined everything is uncertain the contrasts carlos rodriguez director of equities at ultraserfinco the shares that have had the worst performance so far in  are those related to the construction sector marcela ramirez equity analyst at actions  valores the recommendation for these shares remains limited as we consider that future announcements could generate devaluations finally not all the figures are red as the preferred shares of davivienda and bancolombia are showing their faces in the market since this year they have been at historical highs with prices of   and   respectively the titles that could reach maximums some of the entities that are also about to follow the path of a good performance in the stock market such as davivienda and bancolombia and that are close to their historical maximums are promigas which has a historical maximum of   and the latest price is   grupo energia bogota with a current price of   and a historical maximum of   likewise it is followed by entities such as isa with maximums of   and a current value of  key weekend for oil this weekend many doubts will be cleared about what will happen in the medium term with oil prices the cartelized countries in the organization of petroleum producing countries opec which still retain almost  of the world market meet in algeria to verify the level of compliance with the production cut agreed by the  members in force since january   the main objective of the meeting is to monitor the commitments and advance in an alliance with producing countries that are outside of opec to maintain market shares that revitalize the income hit since  the year in which they fell dragging finances from countries highly dependent on oil revenues such as arabia and venezuela and from others not as productive as the colombian case that experienced a financial crisis due to this unexpected fall which had much to do with the selfsufficiency of the united states the second largest consumer of fossil fuels the meeting this sunday will be by videoconference and it is the preparatory for the great facetoface summit that always takes place in vienna during december it is key to bear in mind that at the end of  the opec countries and  other large producers  led by russia  decided to reduce production by  million barrels per day starting from the level of october of that year with the objective to make the low supply bring prices around us   in such a way that the finances of highly dependent countries improve given the growth of other energy sources such as renewables and the widespread use of fracking in consumer countries such as china and the united states a controversial practice but very effective in fields considered low production the algiers meeting is held within the us   mark on average and with an upward trend both brent and wti have tried unsuccessfully to consolidate above this figure considered by various experts as the ceiling of no return that is  above the price at which  ended and which is considered the floor so as not to go down again in the next five years these figures have been studied by producers before the imminent growth of other energy sources that put at risk the great demand for oil that has not only changed geopolitics but also developed industries of the second industrial revolution the international energy agency office of the organization for economic cooperation and development sees other determining factors so that the price of crude does not fall they have to do with the high hurricane season in the gulf of mexico area trade war between the united states and china and pressures on the growth of the economies of emerging countries many dependent on oil another aspect to take into account and make speculations about the price of crude oil is that on november  the trade sanctions announced by donald trump against iran come into force a situation that will reduce iranian crude exports which encourages expectations of a rebound in the additional price so far things are happening so that ecopetrols accounts improve and the country accounts with good oil pricesuso and ecopetrol reached agreements within the

 oil could go as high as us   commodities trading firms trafigura and mercuria commented at an industry symposium on monday that oil prices could rise to us   per barrel by the end of the year or

after the company remained in the last weeks of september reaching highs for the year on this occasion a new rise in brent which is currently trading at us   with a  growth in the year leads ecopetrols share to reach levels above   representing an annual growth of  the companys stock on the new york stock exchange also shows growth at this time reaching us   after gaining  the fact is that brent prices are hitting their highest values since  as us sanctions against iran take effect and a north american trade agreement fosters growth after the us and canada forged a agreement on sunday to rescue the north american free trade agreement nafta as a trilateral pact with mexico rescuing a us   trillion free trade zone that was about to closebrent reaches  highs and ecopetrol shares rise  the upcoming entry into force of sanctions by the united states against iran the drop in production in venezuela for a few months and the companys good performance are the main circumstances that have generated good news for ecopetrol shareholders although since the last weeks of september the colombian oil company had been hitting highs of the year now a new increase in the behavior of the heaviest reference for oil brent benefited the value of the oil companys title to present an annual growth of   placing it at a price above   as it was announced at the close of the market brent reached a price above us   per barrel with a growth in the year of  levels that had not been reached since  while the light reference wti was quoted at us   per barrel as explained by the agrarian bank these prices are associated with the gradual reduction in the drilling of new wells in the united states a factor that further accentuates the expectation of a limitation in crude production in the fourth quarter of  analyzing the stock behavior of ecopetrols papers it has not only performed well on the local stock market but also on the new york stock exchange where it shows positive growth which reached us   after gaining   at the close of the day in this market the rise has been more important due to the liquidity of the north american market related article ecopetrol won the auction and will now be able to exploit crude oil in the brazilian basin omar suarez manager of equity at casa de bolsa explained that this appreciation of ecopetrols share has been due to the rise in the price of oil and this break in the barrier of us   per barrel has had a positive effect on it but this is also accompanied by the good results of the company the operational dynamics and the expectations about the possible purchase of reserves abroad from a technical point of view ecopetrols share at   is the next level to reach  it should be noted that brent prices are touching their highest values since  as us sanctions against iran come into effect and a north american trade deal fosters growth after the us and canada forged an agreement on sunday to rescue the north american free trade agreement nafta as a trilateral pact with mexico rescuing a free trade zone that was about to be closed but then is this the right time to buy a colombian company title for analysts this is a decision that can only be made if the behavior of oil continues with the same trend since to the extent that the price of oil continues with its upward behavior ecopetrols action will continue that trend trend the contrasts omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa the rebound is also accompanied by the good results of the company such as operational dynamics and expectations regarding possible purchases of reserves abroad expectations for crude at us   since last week trafigura and mercuria commodity trading companies stated that oil prices could reach us   per barrel by the end of the year or early  the main reason for this possible increase it is the impact that could be generated by the united states sanctions against iran this because almost two million barrels per day bpd of crude could leave the market as a result by the end of the fourth quarter of this yearadditional recovery factor point would add  million barrels since the end of last week the price of a barrel of brent has hovered around us   which is good news for the oil sector because it not only receives higher revenues but also has the resources to invest in exploration projects and exploitation with this additional income the industry will be able to improve the recovery rate which has historically remained at  which would allow increasing production and reserves in fact according to estimates by the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol for each additional percentage point that the recovery factor increases nearly  million barrels of oil are added to reserves according to julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet with the current price level the country has a high potential in improved recovery since these projects are intensive in capital technology and demand for goods and services  so at lower prices they would not be viable in addition the rate has to grow if you take into account that  and  are the minimum recovery that is handled in the international market colombia can bet on more than  million barrels of oil if we set ourselves the countrys objective to increase five percentage points of the factor he said according to studies carried out by ecopetrols improved recovery laboratory the country has investigated for more than  years in the area of improved recovery but the use of these technologies in the field has not yet become a common practice although yes there is in the country the contrasts julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers improved recovery is to extract more from the current fields using specialized technology that allows increasing the volume of hydrocarbons to be recovered german espinosa president of the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services the improved recovery is one of the important options that the country has for the incorporation of new reserves and therefore to increase its production levels the oil company has bet on this technology in which since  it has invested us   million only in  investments in recovery reached us   million and the amount for  was similar the fruit of these investments has been seen in recent years because in the case of last year of the  million barrels of oil equivalent that ecopetrol added to its reserves  million were from improved recovery this is equivalent to  of the added reserves in the first half of this year the recovery contributed  barrels a day to production which reached  barrels a day although the prices of recovery technologies vary as their degree of specialization increases those that facilitate the extraction of crude oil through the injection of water or the alternate injection of water and gas would be profitable with a price of crude oil in the us   german espinosa president of campetrol highlights that more options have arrived in the country such as the injection of carbon dioxide steam and polymers of which there are already fields of course this technology has its environmental impacts but the risks are quite low he mentioned oil industry contributed   billion to the country in  the oil sector contributed   billion to the colombian economy which came from taxes royalties and contractual rights among others according to the colombian petroleum association acp   billion of these resources correspond to income tax which increased  times compared to  the royalties correspond to   billion which in  was    trillion since  the hydrocarbons sector has contributed more than   billion in income tax to the countryoil is trading at fouryear highs due to sanctions on iran in full countdown to the entry into force of the sanctions imposed by the united states on iran which would begin to be applied on november  a barrel of brent oil surpassed the barrier of us   yesterday close to a maximum of four years  specifically the benchmark barrel in europe was trading over us   on wednesday which represented an increase of  compared to the previous day before the close of the session and it is that the fear of the effect of the sanctions of the us giant has already begun to reduce crude exports from iran which is considered the third largest producer of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec added to the sharp drop in oil production in venezuela was the fear that the sanctions imposed on iran would lower its production this generates an impact on the supply of crude in the world and generates an upward pressure on international prices once it broke us   the brent benchmark opened the door to reach a level of us   said omar suarez manager of equity at casa de bolsa additionally the rise in the international price of crude oil occurred despite the fact that countries such as saudi arabia and other oil producers announced their willingness to pump more to generate a greater world supply for its part the us benchmark wti also advanced yesterday to us   which represented an increase of  compared to the previous session the level of intermediate oil in texas also represented the highest value reached in the last four years since last year opec and other allies such as russia have been limiting crude production to get rid of the existing oversupply however despite this rise in the price of crude oil according to the bloomberg news agency opec would have ruled out carrying out an additional increase in production in addition to the increase that is already agreed to next june regarding crude inventories in the us the american petroleum institute api published that they rose by  barrels in the week to september  to  million for its part the energy information administration eia said that us crude stocks increased last week by  million barrels due to higher production in refineriesthere are five colombian companies among the best forbes employers related article there are only  women among forbes  richest entrepreneurs in the united states forbes magazine today published the list of the best employers in the world based on its global  index of the largest companies in the world in this ranking the presence of colombia was summarized in five companies where the suramericana investment group was the most prominent ranking  in the general ranking the four national companies that were also present on the forbes list were grupo bolivar ecopetrol grupo aval and bancolombia which occupied positions    and  respectively of the sectors to which each company belongs investment services stood out encompassed by suramericana and grupo aval the banking sector was also present with bancolombia the business and personal services sector with aval and the oil and gas operations sector with ecopetrol as for the leaders of the forbes list four companies in the top  belong to sectors linked to technology as alphabet microsoft apple and amazon belong to the computing software and internet industries in addition they occupy positions    and  respectively the only company out of the top five that is not part of this ecosystem is the walt disney company which ranks fourth among the best employers in the world and operates in the broadcast and cable industry alphabet the parent company of google led the way for the second year in a row with a perfect score according to forbes analysts the company has more than  employees and its most notable financial records include   billion in sales   billion in profits   billion in assets and a market value of   billion in the last yearthe current price of oil will double the transfers from ecopetrol to the nation the president of anif sergio clavijo highlighted the good moment that oil prices are passing for public finances a fact that would have an impact on the strength of the tax reform that the government will present during the  assembly the president of the financial studies center acknowledged that the current levels of crude oil will have a direct effect on the transfers that ecopetrol makes to the central government according to clavijio oil prices are being taken advantage of at us   per barrel ecopetrol will go from transferring  of the gross domestic product gdp and will bring it to about  of gdp  which is the way the higher spending is going to be financed according to the president of anif this increase is almost equivalent to a tax reform that is why the government is lowering the tone of the tax system and is doing the same what happened in  when the santos administration arrived it encountered a bonanza which postponed a reform however for clavijo this is not the correct way in which the governments fiscal emergencies should be addressed they force us to think about a financing law which will be presented in  days the ideal is to use the additional ecopetrol to establish spending on infrastructure to have a spare  in case the momentum of the sanction has passed to iran and crude oil drops to us   per barrel because if that happens around d e one year we are going to be in trouble clavijo said similarly he recalled the growth projections revised last september much of which will depend on sustained oil prices in accordance with these expectations a growth of  is expected for  and for next year  in the gross domestic productcano limon no date to resume operation after  days of paralysis ecopetrol does not have a set date to resume pumping crude through the colombian cano limoncovenas pipeline suspended for  days due to attacks by the guerrillas of the national liberation army eln and a collapse that broke the pipeline it said on wednesday a company source so far this year the  pipeline has been the target of at least  attacks attributed to the eln in addition to the discovery of dozens of illegal valves for the theft of crude oil the most recent suspension of the pipelines operation began on august  but it has not affected production from the cano limon fields because oil is being evacuated through another pipeline nor has it altered exports according to sources from the oil sector and ecopetrol we still do not have a date to restore pumping work has been delayed due to insecurity problems in the area and heavy rains said the ecopetrol source one of the events that keeps the pipeline paralyzed with the capacity to transport more than  barrels per day from the production fields in the department of arauca operated by occidental to a port in the caribbean sea from where the crude is exported was a collapse caused due to the rains that broke the pipe on september  this year the cano limoncovenas was out of operation for six months the longest paralysis since it began to function in  in almost  years the pipeline has been the target of more than  attacks attributed to the leftist guerrillas who have maintained it out of operation for the equivalent of  years causing the spill of some  million barrels of crude president ivan duque who took office in august has conditioned the continuity of a peace negotiation with the eln on the rebels unilaterally suspending the kidnappings attacks and locating themselves in a geographic area with international supervision demands that the rebel group rejected in last analysts fear that an eventual decision by the government to permanently suspend negotiations with the eln will lead to an increase in attacks against the countrys economic infrastructure including oil pipelinesecopetrol transfers would reach  of the gross domestic product the rebound in oil prices will have a direct impact on the resources that the state receives as highlighted by the president of anif sergio clavijo who highlighted the benefits of the oil minibailout in public finances clavijo acknowledged that the levels reached by brent will have a direct effect on the transfers that ecopetrol makes to the government according to the expert oil prices are being used at us   per barrel with which ecopetrol is going to transfer  of the gross domestic product gdp and is going to take it to close to    of gdp the way in which the higher government spending will be financed  for the president of anif this increase is almost equivalent to a tax reform that is why the government is lowering the tone of the tax system and is doing what happened in  when the santos administration arrived it found a bonanza which postponed a reform  however for clavijo this is not the correct way in which the governments fiscal emergencies should be addressed which force us to think about a financing law which would be presented on monday october  the ideal is to use the ecopetrol additional to anchor spending on infrastructure to have a spare in case the momentum of the sanction on iran has passed and crude falls to us   per barrel because if that happens after a year we are going to be in trouble he said similarly he recalled the growth projections revised in september which will depend on sustained oil prices in accordance with these expectations growth of  is expected for  and for next year  in gdp company prepayment for his part the financial superintendent jorge castano highlighted the behavior of the commercial portfolio which has had negative growth rates according to the official this can be explained by two components the first is that there are no demands for commercial loans the companies are not demanding credit working with their own resources  additionally he indicated that there is a phenomenon of companies which begin to fulfill obligations in advance we are seeing many prepayments such as from companies in the real sector with an amount close to   trillion explained particularly by a prepayment that ecopetrol made to banks in the country this phenomenon causes that when comparing the dates the balances fall according to indicated castano the official also said that systemic debtors have been identified who can generate their provisions such as electricaribe ips and the mass transportation systemnational budget due to strikes only  days have passed since the administration of ivan duque began and he has already had to experience two complex situations that in one way or another compromise the economic discussions the first had to do with the confinement that a few leftwing congressmen made to the minister of finance alberto carrasquilla for his role in the socalled water bonds an episode of more than a decade ago that did not go well for the municipalities that they adopted this financing alternative it should be noted that the national government came out well and that the minister was not subjected to the constitutional figure of the motion of censure that was not covered in congress a situation from which carrasquilla was saved but weakened him as the other parties that are not in national unity came to his rescue an action that will not be free for future political negotiations both in the chamber and in the senate  the second important episode during these first  days of duque in the house of narino occurred yesterday when thousands of students took to the streets to demand more budget for public university education the marches that demanded a fair number of points put the finger on the sore point of the limited resources for any sector it is not only education that does not have money or the only sector in which public spending must be redirected since it is no secret to anyone that investment in education has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years and it is not only the sector that takes the most money but the one that has grown the most from   trillion it is already close to   trillion an unprecedented fact in economic history never before has a sector received such an amount that if we observe that the budget is only equivalent to   billion to meet the needs of the entire country why are the failed motion of censure against the minister of finance and the march of the students closely linked for the simple reason that both have to do with public money minister carrasquilla must draw up the financing law of the current administration and for this he must make use of new taxes that guarantee to cover a historical deficit gap of about   billion and for this purpose he has to bring to congress an article that avoids the maximum political negotiations such as the institutional redesign of the dian and the adoption of digital tools to gain efficiency in the collection of taxes in addition to attacking tax evasion fortunately it has a margin of maneuver that the previous administration did not have oil prices are going through a bonanza and ecopetrols revenues are increasing dramatically budgets were planned with a barrel of oil at us   the current price has been sustained above us   a significant difference that can help the financing law not be so harsh against entrepreneurs and that a better economic performance does that families also improve their income the half trillion pesos that the students obtained from the government is also manageable if macroeconomic conditions continue to improve at the rate of oil but the national budget cannot continue to fatten up through strikes it is unfortunate that they are already planning new marches to demand public moneysuramericana best employer in the country according to forbes global  as usual forbes released the list of

colombia a report that evaluates the corporate reputation of companies and entrepreneurs in which sura ecopetrol nestle and the national university climbed positions compared to  bancolombia grupo nutresa and alpina remained in the first three places as in the previous year sura rose eight positions from eighth to fourth and cementos argos was fifth after falling one position the sixth place

dropped three places went from fifth to eighth nestle which rose two went from  to nine and the national university which went from position  to  and managed to be in the list reputation is sustained by two pillars corporate identity and recognition the first has to do with organizational history strategy and culture the second with the recognition that its main stakeholders make of these behaviors said menuel sevillano mercos ceo regarding business leaders arturo calle from comercializadora arturo calle david bojanini from grupo sura and carlos ignacio gallego from grupo nutresa they occupied the first three places in the rankingincrease in reputation of sura ecopetrol and nestle in ranking prepared by merco building reputation is a longterm job that requires perseverance structuring and internalization and although bancolombia grupo nutresa and alpina continue to be the organizations that have done the best the task sura ecopetrol and nestle stood out this year for having the greatest advances in the top  on the list an effort that was reflected with a rise in positions in the  version of the merco empresas colombia ranking in the first  places were located in order bancolombia grupo nutresa alpina sura cementos argos ecopetrol bavaria grupo epm nestle and the national university while grupo exito entered the top of the   organization corona  colombina  postobon  avianca  davivienda  universidad javeriana  universidad del rosario  comercializadora arturo calle  and google   the contrasts jorge mario velasquez chairman of grupo argos we are pleased that the subsidiaries and their leaders are recognized by reputation it is the result of a judicious and committed work  felipe bayon president of ecopetrol it is a satisfaction to rise three positions in the list in  a year in which we are reaping the fruits of the transformation carried out at ecopetrol juan carlos mora president of grupo bancolombia we believe that the ethics and integrity of organizations are their greatest reputational capital that is why we always seek to generate trust and credibility david bojanini chairman of grupo sura reputation is based on coherence between what we declare and our actions as well as consistent management ricardo sierra president of celsia these results confirm that the stakeholders have a positive concept of the company because we have been consolidating ourselves as an innovative company cristina de la vega executive director of alpina to occupy this position once again is a source of pride and a great challenge because we must continue working in accordance with our principles and with our values juan esteban calle president of cemargos to be considered as a one of the companies with the best reputation in the country is the result of the work of more than  employees who have made this company a benchmark for service credibility trust quality and innovation  antonio nunez lemos president nestle of colombia we received this result with great satisfaction because for us the perception that colombians have about our management is definitive sura headed by its president david bojanini was the company that climbed the most positions among the top  in  the holding company ranked eighth while this year it rose to fourth after gaining four positions and obtaining a score of  out of  advances in these reputation measurements are the result of doing things well and fulfilling our promise of value that is our audiences recognize a performance that applies good practices based on ethical principles and developing longterm relationships bojanini said the second that increased the most was ecopetrol a company led by felipe bayon last year the oil company was located in box number nine and this year it went to six which represented a rise of three positions it is a satisfaction to rise three positions in the list in  a year in which we are reaping the fruits of the transformation carried out to make ecopetrol a more efficient and profitable company now we have the mission of showing colombians that we are energy that transforms colombia that is a new higher purpose  stated bayon nestle and colombina also made the list after climbing two positions each the swiss multinational today led by antonio nunez lemos closed  at number  but this year it entered the list of the first  after obtaining  points while colombina whose president is cesar caicedo went from position  to  related article nutresa epm and sura rose in the merco talent ranking for manuel sevillano mercos ceo the secret of reputation lies in its construction structural the reputation of a company is multifaceted it means that it incorporates all its perspectives the market its ability to acquire and retain talent the quality of the return to its shareholders and even how it takes responsibility for its communities in that sense the manager explained that this ranking combines two views on the one hand everything that is related to the companys corporate identity is taken into account that is what companies do what they think and how they do it factors that are embedded in their organizational culture on the other hand merco takes into account the recognition that the companys actions generate in its stakeholders a manager asked me how reputation is measured and i invited him to do an experiment i told him to stick with his routine for a week to keep selling and offering his services but without using his corporate brand i explained to him that with the results he was going to understand what impact his reputation had on the results said the spokesperson leading brands by sectors merco also detailed which are the leading companies in reputation for each economic sector in food the leader is grupo nutresa in insurance companies sura in hygiene beauty and personal care it is natura cosmeticos in compensation funds it is compensar in cement plants it is cemargos in agribusiness it is grupo manuelita and in electronic commerce it is rappi regarding clothing the first place was occupied by arturo calle in business conglomerates leadership in reputation is held by the ardila lulle organization in household appliances haceb in electronics computers and software apple in pharmaceutical johnson  johnson in finance bancolombia in pension funds protection in industry corona organization in mining cerrejon in tourism aviatur in passenger transport avianca and in telecommunications movistar in addition to the first three places there are other brands that maintained their position from last year such as postobon which retained its  position and natura cosmeticos which is still in  place it must be said that the image of a company is temporary but the reputation is strategic structural and longterm so to build it companies must be constant concluded sevillano epms result did not fall due to ituango although the crisis that epm is going through in hidroituango is the deepest in its history the company only fell three places in the reputation ranking it went from fifth to eighth position manuel sevillano director of merco explained that although the particular metrics of the company have not been reviewed it is easy to find correlations in the rises and falls of companies what epms position means is that it has handled the situation adequately and its stakeholders have recognized this he said how is the reputation of the firms evaluated to make the list merco made four types of evaluation with managers with experts with other monitors consumption digital talent and with benchmarking respectively each one had a weight of    and  on the final grade in the first which is the responsibility of managers  members of the management committees of companies operating in colombia answered the questionnaire with a turnover of more than us   million  experts participated in the second process  financial analysts  economic information journalists  government members  ngo representatives  union members  members of consumer associations  professors  influencers and  leaders of opinion in the third procedure the firm took into account the results found in its digital rankings which was a novelty for  consumption which had the participation of  people and talent whose sample was  participants finally in benchmarking mercos technicians assessed reputational merits with a sample of  indicatorsvolatility will set the pace at the end of the year this october only has six business days left to recover from the volatile economic days that have marked recent weeks full of uncertainty in all secondary markets which remain nervous due to the political and energy tensions that have in saudi arabia their epicenter political for the murder of the journalist jamal khashoggi an event that has strained relations with turkey and energy because the arab kingdom itself confirmed that it is willing to redesign the global energy market that means not playing more to continue raising oil prices and the consequences have already started to show this week the brent benchmark fell to   or  a percentage far from the   that had been bet just three days ago saudi arabia said it would counteract the drop in global supply that us sanctions will imply on iranian exports the volatile oil situation has led the dollar to strengthen in most emerging markets in colombia the us currency closed above the   barrier registering averages close to   the maximum price reached   both the decline in oil and the rise in the dollar caused several stocks that had registered significant increases in recent days to fall unavoidably ecopetrols share fell to    less than in the last day while daviviendas paper also fell to    with oil prices falling the dollar rebounding and share gains amid uncertainty the end of this  points to be frantic as the imminent establishment of the new governments tax reform that has promised to lower can be added corporate taxes expanding the tax base and generalizing the  vat for all products once the general budget law for  is approved it is expected that congress can discuss the new taxes before the first half of december about six weeks to debate in joint commissions on the new taxes all this in the midst of the resurrection of the buried motion of censure against the minister of finance alberto carrasquilla not everything is uncertain in the closing panorama dian announced that the income statement for individuals exceeded all collection goals the income reached   billion money contributed to the national treasury by  taxpayers which increased at  it is a healthy fact for the national coffers that three million colombians already declare income an unthinkable figure until a few years ago there is other good news and that is that  of taxpayers fulfilled their obligation to present the return virtually through dians computer systems and only  did so through lithographic returns or chemical paper it is on this reality that the new tax reform must be drawn up since it is a fact that three million taxpayers have appropriated new technologies to pay their debt to the state it is necessary to carry the payment of taxes to this type of facilities so that it is not an annual torment to declare incomelearn about the history behind the birth of ecopetrol more than  years ago although the current situation shows an uncertain future the oil sector in colombia is one of the most promising in the region taking into account that there is an institution that for more than  years has worked in favor of this industry it is ecopetrol the flagship of the sector and the country in general its origins date back to the first half of the  century when standard oil of new jersey entered the national territory exactly in  its entry was achieved thanks to a merger between the international petroleum company ipc a subsidiary of the imperial oil company and the tropical oil company a company with the right to produce oil in the mares concession located in the barrancabermeja region santander where the refinery currently operates the fact was recorded by different national and international media such as the new york times a us newspaper in which it was reported that the merger generated expectations of a high production in barrancabermeja comparable to that of the large mexican wells and the increase in investment in exploration in colombia and peru in this sense jersey through its subsidiaries became the dominant player in the exploration production refining transportation domestic distribution and export of oil in colombia during this time however in  with the reversal of the mares concession contract its dominance over the oil sector ended and ecopetrol was born although its foundation occurred in the second half of the  century it all began around  when the government of general rafael reyes granted a concession for the exploitation of oil to roberto de mares which would mark the first part of the century until the start of start of the company exactly on august   initially the company was established as the exclusive property of the national government and in  it became a public limited company which allowed the capitalization of  of this by private investors which meant the largest share placement operation carried out in colombia although ecopetrols businesses have constantly moved there are four that reflect the companys historical perspective the first deals with the transit of oil businesses that were in the hands of the mares concession to the recently inaugurated ecopetrol in the second instance one can speak of the period between the start of operations of the company until the  time in which ecopetrol as a business organization takes charge of business some after a certain time and decides on the paths to follow the third moment covers the boom period of association contracts between the  and the late  the commitment to refining and petrochemicals inherited from the  was transformed into a new emphasis on exploration and production and a greater effort to integrate the businesses finally the fourth moment ventures into the businesses of the now ecopetrol sa during the last decade the contrasts sergio clavijo president of anif ecopetrol is going to go from transferring  of the gross domestic product gdp to  of gdp felipe bayon president of ecopetrol completing a capital expenditure plan of between us   and us   million this year will be a challenge this was confirmed by the company in the book with which it commemorated its  years of existence there the oil company recalls that between  and  a strategy was designed to produce  barrels of oil equivalent in  this result was achieved two years earlier and the goal was doubled for  in addition via taxes royalties and dividends ecopetrol went from representing   billion in  to   billion in  these figures demonstrated with facts that for the colombian state it was better to have  of a strengthened and growing company than  of the company that existed at the beginning of the past decade the barrancabermeja refinery has different techniques for the extraction of crude oil by  the refinery produced polyethylene and by  it also entered its facilities with aromatics this is an image of what ecopetrols refinery looked like in the  when until now a flagship project in the country was beginning to take holdin colombia companies spend  hours a year paying taxes year after year colombian businessmen place the tax burden as one of their greatest concerns when doing business generating productivity and creating more employment in the country added to the high taxes are unbalanced charges high levels of payments and the need to create a more simplified system that generates greater competitiveness precisely the proposal to create more competitive rates together with the elimination of more than  exemptions the digitization of tax platforms and the simplification of the system has been one of the flags of president ivan duque since his electoral campaign specifically the promise that the president would include in the next financing law would be to reduce the tax rate assumed by companies at the levels of the countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd that is around of  related article taxing the  richest would give the government an additional   billion to do this duque has always maintained the argument that it will not touch the middle class and that a possible way to compensate for this loss of income could be through applying a higher tax on the income of higher natural persons from there he plans to generate a higher tribute to the approximately  people who pocket about   million each month something that could generate additional income of up to   billion for the state we consider it to be a good tax incentive to attract new international businesses and encourage the creation of new national companies at the same time this strategy aims to increase business development and their sustainability by redirecting these tax resources to increased productivity even generating new jobs and creating greater economic dynamics in the country  said rosmery quintero executive president of the national association of micro small and medium enterprises acopi exactly among the proposals that the ministry of finance presented to congressmen in september regarding what the next law could lead to was a chapter that analyzed the possibility of reducing the rental rate of legal entities so that it reaches  as of  if this initiative is carried out the government would begin to lose income as of  with a fall of   trillion that could be offset by the   trillion that would generate a  tax on income highest those who earn   million per month appear in the proposal how much taxes do they bear given this situation it is convenient to analyze what is the true effective rate at which colombian companies pay how many taxes they assume and how the system is compared to the rest of the countries of the region related article colombian entrepreneurs are the third most taxed in the region according to the report paying taxes  prepared by the world bank and pricewaterhousecoopers pwc colombian entrepreneurs are the third most taxed in the region with a rate of  these are only surpassed by those that support in argentina  and in bolivia  the fourth highest tax and corporate contribution rate in the region is held by brazil  and the top five is closed by venezuela  however other studies such as the report how much is actually taxed in colombia of the banco de la republica indicate that the really effective rate that is the one that remains once all the tax benefits have been applied is of the order of  also in the report on this problem by the authors jairo orlando villabona and carlos jose quimbay herrera it was established that the average real rate during the period  to  with figures from the aggregates of the dian income statements was   in total the doing business  report estimated that companies operating in the local area bear  large payments each year among which are income tax social security contributions wealth tax vat or the tax on financial movements gmf or  among others additionally they must also respond to local governments with taxes such as property or industry and commerce ica likewise according to the same report in which colombia fell from position  to  due to this problem it was evidenced how colombian companies must spend  hours paying taxes which is equivalent to almost  days in the oecd countries it usually takes an average of  hours to comply with this obligation the contrasts rosmery quintero president of acopi reducing the burden will increase the productivity of the companies and give positive responses in terms of reducing evasion bruce mac master president of andi the companies have very high tax rates but at the same time we collect very little taxes it is a paradox  unbalanced charges among all the charges the one that weighs the most on legal entities is that of income tax since it represents around  of the total tax rate according to pwc labor taxes are around  and with the remaining  they pay the rest of taxes related article only  of workers must file their income tax return the problem of corporate taxation is further aggravated if one takes into account that income tax charges are totally unbalanced since they are in the lead of the firms thus while in the oecd countries  of the collection of this tax comes from natural persons in colombia this percentage only reaches  which is why  is assumed by societies but the obstacles do not end there because in reality the income of the companies is concentrated in a few taxpayers who are the ones who really assume the majority of the pie according to calculations from four years ago the  largest companies in the country assume more than  of this tax while the rest only pay  in this way the companies that would be contributing the most would be some such as grupo exito ecopetrol terpel epm argos or avianca we have a paradox very high tax rates but we collect very little taxes the reason is that very few pay them only  companies pay income tax in the country in other words only  of companies pay  taxes in colombia andi president bruce mac master said in inside lr another issue debated is whether or not the tax benefits that companies have are justified since the charges are higher for those that do not have specific privileges such as those enjoyed by companies benefiting from free zones exemptions or important special liquid income  or legal stability contracts the collection is not enough despite the progress that has been made in the previous tax reforms and the greater burden that companies assume today it has not been possible to expand the total collection of the government which is stagnant at levels of  of the gdp for years below the  and  rates found in most of the countries in the region as a percentage of gdp according to anif calculations the total government tax collection was divided as follows last year direct corporate taxation collected  indirect consumption taxes such as vat and impoconsumo they represented  household income only reached  and another  was due to other types of taxes to raise national collection once and for all and close the structural fiscal gap the proposal that anif has been defending in recent months has mainly three components withering the legal stability contracts and eliminating the privileges related to free zones   of gdp higher taxation of natural persons  of gdp and the expansion of the vat base  of gdp this reform should raise additional resources for at least  of gdp by  with this the total tax collection would rise from the current  to about  of gdp says the proposal of the center for economic studies more companies will be formalized the benefits of alleviating the tax burden that companies currently assume would be many according to oscar valencia director of macroeconomic policy of the ministry of finance not only would productivity improve but formal employment would grow and the economy would reactivate up to  of gdp that same opinion is shared by the professor of economics at the universidad del rosario alejandro useche who stressed that companies will gain in competitiveness and formalization they could manufacture products or provide services at a lower cost that could be more desirable in international markets in addition this reduction could help formalization today there are many that do not register due to high taxes he declared read tomorrow the tax benefits of free zones companies that set up in a free zone have multiple benefits that allow them to boost their national and international activity these companies pay less in income tax they are exempt from vat for raw materials or inputs or they are free to repatriate their profits among others due to their privileged situation these geographical areas were highly debated by the different candidates in the presidential campaign specifically duque at that time proposed that the food storage and supply centers have a similar regime to improve the conditions of small and medium producers now that he is president the presidents goal is for these spaces to generate employment for  people in  currently colombia has  free zones in which more than  companies from multiple sectors operateecopetrol activated a contingency plan after the attack on the cano limon pipeline the colombian petroleum company activated its contingency plan in the rural area of curaba boyaca due to the new attack that the cano limon covenas pipeline suffered yesterday afternoon the attack caused the oil spill through a natural channel by generating a crater and affecting the tube according to the company at the time of the event the pipeline was out of operation and the valves were closed ecopetrol began extracting the crude last night and installed two portable storage tanks and containment barriers upstream from the natural channel of the spill today the company will continue with cleaning and recovery activities and will also fly over the area the municipal councils for risk and disaster management of curaba boyaca and arauca arauquita and saravena of the department of arauca were notified of what happened the environmental authority corporinoquia was also informed ecopetrol rejected what happened describing the events as violent that not only threaten the oil infrastructure but also negatively impact the environment and generate losses for the region and the countryecopetrol will present its third quarter results report on october  ecopetrol sa reported that next wednesday october  after the market closes it will announce its financial and operating results for the third quarter of  on thursday november   the administration will offer two conference calls in english and in spanish to comment on the results obtained people

lead quarterly revenues that will be reported to the bvc a new period for the delivery of financial results of companies listed on the stock exchange begins against which some have released their calendar while others have revealed approximate dates related article ten bvc issuers are part of the dowjones mila sustainability index the closest to disclosing their returns for the third quarter of the year would be the pan de azucar group gpa and the nutresa food group which will announce the results today october  the season is continued by ecopetrol at the end of the month while in the first  days of november most of the remaining companies will announce their numbers according to omar suarez manager of equity at casa de bolsa ecopetrol will have positive results while the cement sector will be weak due to internal fundamentals since the construction sector in colombia has shown less movement during the season the analyst also shares that the financial sector continues to deteriorate in portfolio quality so it will be looking a bit weak while avianca is affected by the price of crude oil  of the companies that will announce their financial results in november fabricato is the one who starts the list on november  followed by celsia and tecnoglass who will report on the  of that same month on november  isa and bancolombia will deliver their respective results november  for its part will be the date on the bvc calendar for companies such as etb cementos argos canacol and terpel to reveal their respective financial reportshydraulic fracturing pilot would cost between us   and us   million the company ecopetrol has everything ready to start a hydraulic fracturing pilot in unconventional reservoirs in three months if the authorities allow it hector manosalva vice president of development and production of the oil company said that they estimate that the cost of this could be between us   million and   million and that the idea would be to drill four or six wells developing a project of unconventional deposits in the middle magdalena valley there is the possibility of increasing between  and  barrels per day he said in addition it is estimated that this type of project can create  additional jobs in the sector since for one job in conventional fields there are three in unconventional ones it would also increase royalties by about   billion each year on various occasions the president of the company felipe bayon has said that colombia has legislation and tools to explore the possibility of fracking in the country in a responsible manner he has also said that it is a methodology that must be explained to the communities to end certain myths such as that it will inevitably pollute aquifers and generate earthquakesecopetrol will invest between us   and us   million in santander just as the country has proposed guidelines for  ecopetrol has also developed an investment strategy for that date in santander in refining the oil company plans to invest us   billion and could invest an additional us   billion in other projects that are currently under evaluation for exploration and production us   billion will also be invested and an additional us   billion could be added an amount that would also depend on the feasibility studies that are being carried out in other projects if the government and the colombian population allow it ecopetrol would invest up to us   billion in unconventional fields which would increase santanders production to  barrels hector manosalva vice president of development and production of ecopetrol highlighted that in the united states the gdp of the sector grew  and employment  since hydraulic fracturing is used in unconventionals we have estimated that if the country exploits these deposits us   billion of added value would be generated per year he said adding that  additional jobs would be created in a year since for every job in conventional deposits three are generated in unconventional if it has the respective approvals ecopetrol could start a fracking pilot in three months which would cost between us   million and us   million and in which four or six wells would be drilledin the first decade bitcoin grew  times more than dow jones a medium of exchange was the original idea with which bitcoin was born thanks to the still anonymous satoshi nakamoto  years ago and although today the exact initial value with which its first transaction took place is unknown to date this cryptoactive reaches a price of us   which generates an appreciation of more than  in its first decade one of the first transactions in  and that approximates the starting value of transactions was the one that was made with  bitcoins to buy two pizzas of us   this would give less than a penny of a dollar per unit today  years later with this value which has suffered the same volatility as ecopetrol shares and indices such as the dow jones this cryptoactive has grown  times in its first decade than for example the stock market index new york in its first decade of operation when it grew  according to carlos mesa director of the bitcoin foundation this has generated benefits for several investors who bought at us   in  and today they already reach us   for this reason alejandro beltran manager of budacom explained that bitcoin was the real protagonist of  when it reached us   per unit for the manager bitcoin is here to stay however it must be taken into account that it is an asset that is maturing and if it is prohibited it is like disconnecting the internet return risk exists in all markets but it must be taken into account that this is trying to include the population that is not banked  the contrasts alejandro beltran country manager of budacom bitcoin is here to stay however it must be taken into account that it is an asset that is in maturity so if it is prohibited it is like disconnecting the internet as with any equity asset volatility has hit bitcoin and that is why in colombia the superfinanciera has issued circulars to close accounts on platforms such as budacom for not having a legal framework however for beltran technology cannot be demonized and there are actions that end up being more speculative because only a few decide what price to put or not mesa added that although the risk remains high investors are now winning in addition the general behavior could already be monitored last year with the performance it hadecopetrols earnings so far in  total   billion the state oil company ecopetrol released its financial results for the third quarter of the year in which it recorded a net profit attributable to its shareholders of   billion for the entire period to september this figure represents a growth of  compared to the same period last year when reviewing the behavior of the quarter alone the company achieved profits of   trillion that is  higher than those achieved in the third quarter of  these results were achieved thanks to the higher levels of hydrocarbon production which reached to  barrels of crude oil equivalent per day kboed in the third quarter of  which represented the highest of the last  quarters additionally the solid operational performance in refining where the highest average load level has been reached at  barrels per day was taken into account added to the efficiency in the reversal operation of the bicentenario pipeline counteracting the impacts associated with the attacks on the cano limon covenas oil pipeline thanks to this last fact it was possible to capture the benefit of better crude prices in the period partially offset by the recognition of the expense associated with noncommercial exploratory investment in blocks  and  in the gulf of mexico leon wells  and    the company indicated in its financial balance for the period for felipe bayon president of the company ecopetrol reported the best financial result of the last four years for the accumulated period of the first nine months of the year a fact that is achieved thanks to the good operational performance of all segments which it has made it possible to increase oil and gas production reduce crude imports for our refining segment and products for the local market  in addition the president of the company highlighted the capture of the benefit associated with better international crude prices which led to the consolidation of the figures in the period another notable fact had to do with the flexibility of ecopetrols commercial strategy which made it possible to take advantage of the greater demand for crude oil from refiners in asia and thus generate greater value on this point bayon explained that in the third quarter of  sales to this destination reached a  share of total crude exports versus  for the same quarter of the previous year financial statements the company reported that during the third quarter the ecopetrol business group achieved solid financial results registering an ebitda of about   trillion   trillion higher than that registered in the same period of  with an ebitda margin of    in relation to its total sales the amount reached   trillion that is a  increase in sales revenue for the third quarter thanks to a higher price of the weighted average basket of crude oil gas and products which was us   higher for each barrel sold among the most important factors in addition to the higher sales in asia the second destination was the us gulf coast despite greater availability of crude in this area and greater discounts on heavy crude the company saidecopetrol broke its record in earnings of the last four years with   billion ecopetrol presented its financial results for the third quarter of this year the net profit for the first nine months of the year was   billion the highest in the last four years in addition compared to the same period in  the growth was  regarding the revenues obtained between january and september these were   billion  more than in the same period of  when   billion were registered it is worth mentioning that the price of a barrel has been higher this year the company reported   billion in operating profit between january and september a figure higher than the   billion recorded in  during these months ecopetrol produced  barrels of oil equivalent per day boped compared to the  boed that were extracted in the same period of  felipe bayon president of the oil company and who with this report has been directing it for a year highlighted that the good results are due to international crude prices the exchange rate and the efficiency plan that the company launched when prices fell in  this excellent financial result was obtained thanks to the good operating performance of all segments which has allowed increasing the production of crude and gas reducing crude imports for our segment of refining and products for the local market and in addition allow the capture of the benefit associated with better international crude prices  he said the same is the opinion of orlando santiago manager of fenix valor who stressed that a large part of the results are due to a combination between the price of oil and the dollar in the third quarter the average price for the wti benchmark was   the highest price in the last four years also the average of the trm between july and september was    he mentioned the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol it is important to highlight that although the price rose the entire process of transformation and efficiencies allowed us to somehow capture the value of that price increase ebitda for the nine months was   trillion ebitda margin of  while in  it was recorded at   trillion ebitda margin  between january and september ecopetrol shipped  boe corresponding to local sales while  boe were sold abroad the total volume of sales was  boed lower than the total sold in the same months of   boped regarding the results of the third quarter the oil company presented sales of   billion  more than in the same period of  the operating profit of the company was   billion  above the presented a year ago while the profit attributable to ecopetrol shareholders reached   billion in production the company registered  barrels per day  more than in  carlos rodriguez director of equities at ultraserfinco pointed out that these are results that have not been seen since before the price drop and that can also be attribute to the investments the company has made to reduce its costs and expenses results of the first year of bayon the published results coincide with the first year of felipe bayon as president of ecopetrol who highlighted that the financial result of these nine months is the best since the last four years the president also mentioned that it has been able to take advantage of the increased demand from refiners in asia in fact sales to this destination reached a  share in the third quarterin  ecopetrol would invest between us   and us   million a range similar to that of  the amount of investments that the colombian oil company ecopetrol would make during  would be similar to that planned for this year between us   million and us   million it has concentrated on exploration and production the president of the company felipe bayon said on thursday the executive emphasized that ecopetrol will meet this years investment goal which was revised in august from an original range of between us   billion and us   billion after the displacement of some activities for next year and the impact of the protests that led to the temporary closure of some fields the idea is that in that sense we do see that that range of us   to us   million per year is the range with which we may possibly enter next year and that somehow denotes stability in the operation and that is quite good from the operational point of view bayon said during a conference call with investors the  investment budget of the oil company is in the process of approval by the board of directors after the slowdown at the beginning of the year ecopetrol made its projects more dynamic in the third quarter bringing investments between january and september to reach us   million that was reflected in a  percent rebound in the companys net profit in the third quarter to   trillion us   million amid better crude prices this increase in activity has allowed us to increase the level of investments the third quarter was a good quarter added bayon the investment has been mainly concentrated in the development of key projects in the exploration and production segment where only in the third quarter an execution was achieved  higher than in the same period of  we have implemented initiatives to speed up the execution of projects and mitigate the impact of social and environmental contingencies materialized in the first half of the year without compromising capital discipline said jaime caballero corporate vice president of financeecopetrol shares fell to  on thursday with devaluation of oil prices a drop in oil prices on thursday led to ecopetrols share falling  in a single day crude oil in its two main references saw losses after the production of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec touched its highest level since  according to information from reuters the group increased its supply by  barrels per day to  million barrels per day this after saudi arabia achieved a new record of  million barrels per day while libya reached its highest point since  the highest supply data comes at a time when there are two days left before the regulations go into effect us sanctions that seek to block the exit of oil from iran the third largest producer in the world this novelty caused crude oil prices to fall by  in the case of brent to us   per barrel and  for the wti benchmark which reached us   the variable income manager of casa de bolsa omar suarez commented that ecopetrols fall is given more weight by the drop in oil prices but added that the company had financial results that although positive were lower than those of projections from bloomberg and brokerage firms  which intensified the fallare  brokers enough twenty years ago at the end of the twentieth century the stock market in colombia had  brokerage firms that catered to those who wanted to invest in the stock market through the three stock exchanges that existed the bogota stock exchange the medellin stock exchange and the occidente stock exchange in cali later after the merger of the three entities in  to create the colombian stock exchange bvc the market had  brokerage firms for the issuance of ecopetrol shares in  the largest and most successful in the market in terms of amount and number of investors  of the  stock brokers in force at the time participated during subsequent years the number of intermediaries in the stock market was reduced due to mergers and liquidations the most important being interbolsa in  at present despite the evolution of the stock market in this century where new share issues managed to reach  investors in the equity market the number of active stock brokerage firms is only  less than half of what there was  years ago is this number of firms sufficient to meet the investment needs of the population in colombia the only entities in the country authorized to provide the service of buying and selling securities in the stock market are stock brokers in fact if a local pension fund with the portfolio of its members a foreign fund or even a state company wants to buy or sell shares on the market they must necessarily contact a stock broker the  investors that the stock market had as of june  would have to do the same when comparing the number of securities intermediaries with other countries in the region that are part of the latin american integrated market mila it can be seen that the stock market in colombia has the lowest number of firms mexico has  chile has  and peru  not to mention the stock market in the united states which has more than  entities in addition when observing the accumulated financial statements of the stock brokers as of september  it is seen that only  firms of the  present highly positive results while the other eight firms strive to stop losses where two entities accumulate higher losses to   million there are six brokerage firms with independent capital the rest are banked or belong to a holding company and in the corridors of the stock market there is talk of the merger of at least two entities that will further reduce the number of intermediaries in the stock market currently only  entities have control of  of the stock market in terms of number of operations and amount traded in all variable income products which include cash operations repos and temporary transfer of securities one of the challenges of the mission of the stock market is to encourage the creation of more intermediaries in said market although it is difficult to determine an adequate number of these entities the truth is that a small number of firms hinders the possibility that millions of colombians with investment capacity can access the stock market and the collective investment funds offered by said intermediariesecopetrol is the best among the four colombian stocks on wall street there are already two colombian companies that have rung the bell to start operations on wall street this year the first was ecopetrol in august celebrating its first decade since its enlistment and the second avianca recently celebrating its first five years on the stock exchange however despite the celebrations the four companies in the country that are listed on the new york stock exchange bancolombia ecopetrol avianca and grupo aval are not going through their best moment the four firms mentioned are currently losing value relative to their listing price the most dramatic cases are those of avianca which in these five years has lost  in its price going from us   to us   and that of grupo aval which has lost  since its inception coincidentally both are the newest firms see chart the oldest ones are not saved either because although at a lower level they are also far from their opening price the oil company has fallen by  and the bank barely  but this is not the same panorama that is reflected when doing the review year to year in this sense ecopetrol is the one that shows its face for the colombians when it sees a  gain so far this year in the value of its share a situation that shows the benefit it has had with the high prices of crude oil avianca for its part has lost  with high fuel prices and the noise caused by the pilots strike grupo aval which arrived in new york in  has fallen  and the bancolombia species is approaching its lowest for the year falling  there is an outflow of foreign funds in emerging stocks that has taken its toll said andres moreno a stock market analyst who also mentioned that one of the most affected has been bancolombia who saw the sounded departure of harbor the contrasts mario acosta strategy manager at ultraserfinco bancolombia and ecopetrol are the most desirable colombians for their liquidity in this exchange the volume traded by the stock matters more than the name of the firm gregorio gandini financial analyst at rogue economist entering new york represents access to a deeper and more liquid market in addition being in such a demanding market very strict emission requirements are met  dollar pending colombian firms that are listed in the united states must do so through a mechanism known as american depositary receipts this system allows each adr purchased by an investor in the us to represent a number of shares on the colombian stock exchange but paid in dollars as an example an ecopetrol adr represents  shares on the colombian stock market the price then depends not only on how the action is doing in colombia but also on the exchange rate if that exchange rate goes up it causes the cost of the share to increase the impact is magnified if the exchange rate is depreciating in colombia the return is lower explained mario acosta strategy manager at ultrarserfinco who clarified that despite the companies being aware of the dollar throughout the year it has not changed so much so the bad moment reflects the action in a higher percentage  among the four colombians that are listed bancolombia is the one that has been on the new york stock exchange the longest with  years since its issuance ecopetrol follows with  avianca with five and the most recent to enlist was grupo aval the other firms that ring in the us stock exchanges some companies participate in the us stock exchanges without being listed this is due to the possibility of negotiating level i adrs which means that transactions can be made between large companies through a mechanism known as over the counter with this they should not make a periodic financial report or pay high issuance and maintenance costs among those that use this type of negotiation are cementos argos isa grupo sura isagen corficolombiana exito and nutresa for its part tecnoglass is listed on the nasdaqavianca developed the i forum of presidents in the mro of jose maria cordova in the i forum of presidents of avianca and marble head hunter that

as main companies in colombia ana maria rubio aviancas vice president of human resources indicated that some of the strategies include being more competitive expanding its market merging and integrating is key for the future at avianca  of its collaborators and employees are millennials human talent must accompany the manager in the strategies you have to start with adaptability and know if you have a clear strategy built with people he said in turn he stressed that if the organizational dna is not in the service implementing it will be more complicated among aviancas main competencies rubio highlighted that they are leadership achievement orientation and purpose to serve something that has helped them reach more than  countries the airline highlighted that one minute invested in a recognition generates  minutes of return on the employees initiative rubio said other figures presented were that  of leaders believe that if they are not digitized by  they will no longer be competitive  of people expect to solve daily tasks with new technologies so human talent always expects better performance from employees and they have a better experience in their workadapting to new trends is key to retaining millennial talent related article what millennials and centennials look for when choosing a job challenges for the main companies in colombia such as sustainability the incorporation of new technologies the willingness to change the fight against corruption as well as the retention of millennial talent are some of the challenges to build true business cultures in which adaptability becomes one of the greatest organizational attributes of today this was one of the conclusions at the  presidents forum that avianca and marble headhunter organized at the airlines mro at the jose maria cordova airport in rionegro renowned executives such as sylvia escovar president of terpel felipe bayon president of ecopetrol bernardo vargas president of isa camilo marulanda president of isagen jorge hernandez vice president of human resources at bbva and ana maria rubio aviancas vice president of human resources who spoke about the development of business cultures and the challenges in this area for the future for each company in the panel marulanda addressed that the issue of millennial incorporation is key to encouraging work with other generations and giving more value to experiences planning is key to becoming better international and thinking things through as entrepreneurs we must work on it to be more competitive he said within isagen the manager highlighted that they are working on important challenges such as cultural transformation diversification of the matrix and advice with quality consultants in the market rubio highlighted that at avianca  of its collaborators and employees are millennials human talent must accompany the manager in the strategies you have to start with adaptability and know if you have a clear idea built with new people he said similarly he emphasized that one minute invested in an acknowledgment generates  minutes of return on initiative by the employee for his part vargas indicated that it is also important to break mentality issues to be more competitive we firmly believe in a coherent vision the challenge in  or  years is to continue inspiring and become sustainable with the communities he emphasized at the same time he highlighted that at isa the internal climate has improved which has evolved from  to  and in terms of results the action has gone from   to a ceiling of   in  which shows that working with people it works you can have high profitability and profits but an event of corruption can destroy the honest work of companies escovar explained that terpel in the fuel sector is the most innovative company we decided for a long time  years to generate memorable experiences this is achieved with innovation disruptive ideas with things that surprise and that in issues such as corruption and technology are absolutely important to apply he added that innovation has to be fully incorporated because whoever does not do it is destined to die we are not leaders if the one who comes behind does it faster in a few years terpel will not have competition because we are going to do things that none of the competitors do our vision is to have no competition in any of the countries where we are because we understand culture and service to people we work to consolidate the operation in the countries where we enter bayon pointed out that it is good to have initiative but it is better to have terminative the transformation of the company has been almost a necessity given the prices of commodities in the global market in  ecopetrol lost almost   billion and was able to recover with determination the contrasts sara castillejos expert in erp and human resources university of antioquia finally hernandez indicated that banks have the challenge of facing all the technologies and the challenge what it means for the sector go from being just financial to being a digital company we are the fourth in market share but we want to modernize colombian banking so we have to respond to the needs of customers and have different access channels to facilitate their transactions and better understand their information he concluded an example of the high impact that new companies can generate compared to traditional ones was explained by the bbva executive since netflix is  years old and has  million customers while bbva is  years old and  million he expressed at the  forum of presidentsecopetrols rex ne field formally begins its productive stage through a statement ecopetrol announced the declaration of commerciality of its rex ne field which means that it formally begins its production stage the oil company highlighted that the discovery well rex   reached its target at the end of november  with an approximate depth of  meters and verified the presence of hydrocarbons in an estimated thickness of  meters since initial testing the well has produced around  barrels per day of very high quality light oil  degrees api this years development plan includes the drilling of two additional wells with which an initial incorporation of reserves is estimated the field is located in the jurisdiction of the municipalities of arauquita and arauca in the department of arauca and is located about  kilometers from the cano limon complex this would allow to take advantage of synergies with this operational area and is part of the harvest association agreement in which ecopetrol and occidental de colombia llc oxy are partners this type of discoveries leverage all the exploratory opportunities that have been identified in arauca and highlights the important potential of hydrocarbon resources in this area of the country can be read at the end of the statementnew attack against the cano limon covenas oil pipeline in boyaca this thursday a new attack was registered against the cano limon covenas pipeline this time in the canaguata village in the municipality of cubara boyaca ecopetrol rejected this new fact which caused the fire of a natural forest and the contamination of about one kilometer of a runoff channel in the village the oil company reported that contingency plans have already been activated and the municipal risk management councils of cubara saravena and arauquita and the departmental councils of boyaca and arauca were alerted ecopetrol personnel closed the valve of the pipeline closest to the area of the attack and is waiting for the public force to secure the area to enter to carry out mitigation and repair activities the company reportedoleoociecopetrol stopped receiving   million in a month with a drop in oil crude prices have fallen dramatically in the last month so much so that today the price of brent has lost  of its value while the wti fell  in the same period and reached a streak of  losses that it had not seen since  these falls are due to first place to higher production data and after knowing that russia the united states and saudi arabia produced more than  million barrels per day bpd in october for the first time this reflects that the three can supply close to a third of global consumption which is close to  million bpd under this environment one of the most affected locally is ecopetrol which is losing the opportunity to sell its barrel of crude at a higher price taking into account that the firm produces  barrels of crude per day with the current exchange rate it would be losing   million a day compared to the data at the beginning of october this calculation is given by multiplying the barrels produced by the oil company by the price of a month ago us   and with the trm at that time which was   thus for a barrel ecopetrol entered   on the contrary with the trm that closes this week   and a barrel at us   it is entering   with which in the month   million would have stopped entering only with the drop in prices the fall in oil in the month is quite important not only for the countrys finances which are affected by the income of dividends by ecopetrol but also in other factors since while brent was above us   the currency and the local market had a cushion that supported them as the best performers among latin americans  said diego velasquez an economic analyst at casa de bolsa how long will the crude fall the tension on supply and demand could be pushing oil prices down for next year commented mario acosta strategy manager at ultraserfinco precisely to the supply data it is added that according to the projections of the energy information administration iea the production of us crude oil will average  million barrels per day in  surpassing the  million bpd mark before than budgeted the contrasts diego velasquez stockbrokers economic analyst the high brent gave us a value of about   in local currency per barrel with current prices the nations income would be greatly impacted  on the demand side there are also added risks on friday chinese economic data showed that producer inflation fell for the fourth consecutive month in october a sign of low economic growth adding to the markets expectation of a difficult  and slow global growth what happened to iran the middle eastern country had been the star player in rising oil prices in the past two months as us sanctions loomed this week iran was in the news again but this time because the government of donald trump decided to make exemptions to some countries so they can buy iranian oil for  more days this year the volatility in oil has been high and everyone expected irans production to cut to zero said wilson tovar head of research for equities and securities but trumps exemptions have managed to remove the pressure on crude oil and its price is reduced as the president wanted is opec splitting up the member nations of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec have sent multiple messages of division in their positions visavis crude oil prices international media have leaked the intention of russia close to the group and saudi arabia to meet to determine their own actions on production in order to balance crude prices while iran has accused its comrades of favoring the wishes of the united states the death of the saudi journalist jamal khashogg generated a change of position of arabia russia requests oil payments in euros to clients the tense global panorama of commercial relations and blockades that has been generated since the arrival of donald trump to the presidency of the united states has caused that several russian oil companies are asking their clients to make the oil payments in euros according to information from reuters which consulted seven industry sources western oil majors and traders clashed with russian producers over the use of euros and other currencies to replace the dollar in contracts this in order to be prepared for possible new us blockades as happened with iranecopetrol activates a contingency plan for a new attack on the oil pipeline through its twitter account ecopetrol announced that it activated a contingency plan after a new attack occurred on the cano limon  covenas pipeline in the cedeno district in the municipality of toledo norte de santander through the tweets the entity affirmed in ecopetrol we reiterate in a forceful way our rejection of any type of activity that endangers the lives of people in any of the surrounding communities and threatens the environment and natural resources  it should be remembered that just two days ago the cano limon covenas pipeline this time in the canaguata village in the municipality of cubara boyaca also suffered an attack so this would be the third in a month on that occasion the oil company rejected this fact which caused the fire of a natural forest and the contamination of about one kilometer of a runoff channel in the villagethe colcap fell again from  points on tuesday with falls in the price of oil the main index of the colombian stock exchange lost  in its session on tuesday and fell again below  points according to omar suarez casa de bolsas equity manager global markets have fallen quite hard in the last two days which has an impact locally in addition to the fact that we come from a holiday bridge so there was a lag from yesterdays falls a new drop in oil prices put pressure on the stock market for the same reason the index lost  points reaching a price of  at the close during the day the most affected action was that of ecopetrol which with the drops in crude prices fell  this action is accompanied by celsia with a loss of  of its value and isa with  suarez pointed out that for the other two stocks there is no particular issue that makes them have such losses beyond the global fall of the markets in addition to the fact that regardless of whether or not they trade in oil the entire index is affected because we are a oil country  on monday the adrs of bancolombia ecopetrol and avianca had already felt the losses due to the external factors that keep the markets in tension the same ones that in october led to the colcap showing the worst performance of this month in  with a decline of ecopetrol america acquired four blocks in the us gulf of mexico related

specified that the announcement of the award of these blocks of the emerald prospect was made after the process of the round gom lease sale   ecopetrol added that the results were made official by the bureau of ocean energy management boem the united states government entity in charge of carrying out the process related article ecopetrol stopped receiving   million in a month with a drop in oil the

exploration blocks in the gulf of mexico the stateowned ecopetrol announced in a statement that its subsidiary ecopetrol america won the green canyon     blocks of the emerald prospect which are located in the gulf of mexico in the united states this result is satisfactory considering that it allows the ecopetrol group to expand its investment portfolio in the gulf of mexico a priority area in our business plan to continue increasing our oil and gas reserves stated felipe bayon president of ecopetrol  this award which was made official by the bureau of ocean energy management boem was made after completing the gomlease sale  round process in which offers were received for  blocks these four exploration blocks are added to the  that the oil company has in the gulf of mexico of these  are in the exploratory phase and  are in development and production so far this year to september the production of the ecopetrol subsidiary is close to  barrels of oil equivalent per day crude and gasit would be irresponsible to abandon the discussion of fracking in colombia the recent ruling of the council of state that suspended the administrative acts with which the government established the criteria for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons extended the uncertainty about the roadmap that the nation will follow regarding this technique faced with the decision the minister of mines and energy maria fernanda suarez said that her portfolio will present an appeal in the coming days and that she will go to all instances at this juncture ecopetrol asked him to assist the portfolio with the resource that they are going to present as they are preparing a pilot plan to implement the extraction technique in early  the president of the oil company felipe bayon spoke about fracking and steps to follow how much does the decision of the council of state affect the plans you had to start the pilot plan at the beginning of  we respect the ruling of the council of state however we will participate in an assistant role to the ministry of mines in which we can be part of the process it is important that some of the things listed in the court document can be explained from a technical point of view its not about us implementing fast fracking its about getting it right and we think were ready to roll out the pilot what is ecopetrol looking for with the pilot plan they are developing for fracking the pilot allows us to have a clear baseline of social and environmental aspects for when we do the activity to know what happened to those factors where people are concerned there is a commission of experts called by the minister of mines to look at the regulation which was not created a fortnight ago but rather collects the best practices worldwide in addition a direct dialogue with the relevant communities will be implemented it should be clarified that this technique has been in development for more than  years what is the importance of developing this technique we have a responsibility to the next generations who do not want to continue seeing the countrys economy growing at  or  but at   or  with this technique people are being given many more opportunities so we must make an orderly transition it would be irresponsible to abandon the discussion of fracking in colombia because it generates profits does ecopetrol have a plan b in place to increase oil production in the event that fracking is inappropriate in the country unconventional deposits are a very important option for the country and that is the debate that must be given in the last  years ecopetrol has given the country more than   billion and that money has helped health education and infrastructure and the company is not going to abandon that goal we are also looking at how to increase production in the conventional fields that we already have let us remember that since we received the field in rubiales we have improved its production and increased it the same in chichimene and in castilla so its not about having a plan a or b its about looking at all of our options what investment figure did ecopetrol establish for next year we are looking at the budget however we believe that that figure is between us   billion or us   billion we are not going to see a decrease in investment because the company has a wellstrengthened financial back your balance sheet and cash generating capacity is very good however the price of oil must be monitored what have ecopetrols investments abroad been used for we have defined our strategy to be a company that operates in the americas therefore we will have four new blocks in the gulf of mexico and we are looking at more opportunities in the united states in mexico we are very pleased with the blocks we have with our allies so much so that pemex executives recently announced their interest in arriving in colombia in brazil we recently entered the presalt field which is playing in the big leagues will you meet the goal set at the beginning of the year to explore  wells to date we have completed nine with a  success rate we hope to close the year with more than a dozen the country needs more exploration and we must produce more in the fields that we already have increasing the recovery factor we must also delve into unconventional fields because if we had to import crude oil to refine it we would have to draw resources from other areas of the economy to implement in the refineries it is better to be selfreliant the good news is that as a result of the crisis of the last two years we came out stronger and today we need a barrel to be just us   to generate profits what has the company done regarding the complaints of venezuelas noncompliance with the gas supply we have asked pdvsa gas to comply with some conditions such as reducing the  content if the gas has a high content of this component it generates corrosion in the transport systems pdvsa recently asked for a price review and we are prepared to have that discussion and reach a beneficial agreementthe unconventionals would help ensure energy security on the last day of the  oil and gas summit the countrys energy security and the need for colombia to guarantee its own supply was analyzed from a business perspective likewise there was a debate on the investment environment and on the adjustments that the hydrocarbon sector should make to improve its perception among the communities regarding the countrys energy security the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon highlighted that the company has been working on different fronts such as exploration improved recovery unconventional deposits and inorganic growth which refers to   billion that the company has in cash and that they serve to fund the projects of the other three fronts in exploration we announced a couple of days ago four new blocks in the gulf of mexico we have a presence that is starting in mexico with two contracts and a presence that is increasing in brazil which would be transformational for the company he said to these strategies to ensure energy in the country is added offshore exploration and exploitation with which production would also increase it is worth mentioning that if the hydrocarbon industry reduces its supply this does not necessarily imply that the demand for energy from colombians will also fall but that it will most likely increase over time and with increasing population this would put pressure on energy rates and the country would be forced to import the commodities it currently produces to feed the energy matrix the contrasts maria fernanda suarez minister of mines and energy the industry must work much more on pedagogy which is a fundamental element and also the sustainable development of the territories felipe bayon president of ecopetrol if today we had to import  barrels for a year every day to refine we would need between us   and us   million depending on the price the unconventionals will ensure energy selfsufficiency it will be the difference between colombians having to live on imported gas or we can produce our own gas and that has a very important impact on our pockets said the minister of mines and energy maria fernanda suarez however the panorama of unconventionals is less clear after the decision of the council of state to suspend its regulatory framework for now minminas presented the appeal whose main argument is that the regulations be fully studied more pedagogy in the sector one of the conclusions reached in several of the panels that were part of the summit is that the sector must do more pedagogy in the communities explain what their processes are like and be detailed in the consequences and benefits  the poor perception they have in the communities has not only slowed down the implementation of new techniques but has also affected investment and the arrival of new companies something that should also be reconsidered is the way in which royalties are distributed as well as delivering works directlycanacol ecopetrol and terpel led revenue growth through september the fact that oil prices remained on average at us   a barrel in the third quarter of the year was one of the main reasons why mining and energy companies reported positive balances in fact between january and september of this year canacol energy ecopetrol and organizacion terpel were the companies that led the increase in income canacol was the one that grew the most in this area the companys turnover presented a positive variation of  going from   million to   million despite the fact that its profits fell  recording losses of   million the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol this increase in activity was reflected in a higher execution of investments during the quarter which amounted to us   million maria fernanda suarez minister of mines and energy the sector has grown in these  years undoubtedly thanks to the drive of ecopetrol but also to the participation of multinational companies in colombia sylvia escovar president of terpel next year will be to consolidate the acquisition of exxonmobil and deliver greater value in service coverage and quality we seek to continue our leadership  related article ecopetrol broke its record in profits of the last four years with   billion ecopetrol meanwhile broke a record the state oil company led by felipe bayon reported an increase in sales of  so its revenues stood at   billion between january and september at a higher rate its net profit grew  and reached   trillion three times higher than that reported in the same period in  when the figure was   trillion in addition its production amounted to  barrels of oil equivalent per day ecopetrol reported the best financial result of the last four years for the accumulated period of the first nine months the increase in production for the quarter is in line with the goal set for  and was achieved thanks to the good results of the drilling campaign and the higher demand for gas from the thermal and industrial sector said bayon related article terpel completed the business with which it will now operate exxonmobil assets terpels quarter meanwhile was marked by one of the most important transactions of the year the purchase of exxonmobils operations in colombia which was completed during the first week of july and represented a move of   million in accordance with the conditions established by the superintendency of industry and commerce with the closing of this business terpel also reported a  growth in revenues and achieved   billion in sales being the third company with the highest increase in this area while its profit was   million with a decrease of  tecnoglass and frontera energy completed the ranking of those with the greatest increase in income the first grew  in billing as of september and reached   million while its profits totaled   after presenting a reduction of  christian daes operating director of tecnoglass highlighted that the growth in sales was a reflection of the good results of the company in the american market regarding frontera revenue growth was    billion the company managed to reduce its loss going from    to    million of  companies  grew sales of the  companies that have published their results in the superfinanciera totaled   trillion that is  more than what this indicator added in the accumulated of  by then the figure it was located at   billion however the biggest rise was in company profits which amounted to   billion an increase of  compared to the   billion obtained in september of last year the compilation of results also showed that of the  companies that reported  managed to grow in income and  in profits which augurs a better end of the year for the business community this december ranking of sales increases by economic sector in mines and energy after canacol ecopetrol and terpel y frontera celsia were located with a growth of    billion epm with    billion geb with    trillion in the case of isa sales fell  they were at   billion in construction the rise was led by tecnoglass and then by el condor with    million other firms such as conconcreto  grupo argos  and cemargos  did not grow by food colombina had an increase of    billion grupo nutresa    billion and alpina    trillion in telecommunications telefonica and etb grew  and  respectively enkas sales increased  and aviancas ecopetrol was milas second most traded share in september according to the latest report from the latin american integrated market during september  the market capitalization of the four markets mexico chile colombia and peru together reached close to us   million mexico was the country with the highest incidence as it contributed us   million to this figure for its part colombia is in third place with a capitalization of us   million the total volume traded in the mila markets was positive for the country the monthly variation was  because transactions in september totaled us   million compared to us   million in august however the country with the best performance was peru with a variation of  however in total there was a fall of  in the total of the four markets due to the decrease of  in mexico the main player in the section of most traded instruments ecopetrol appears in second place with a volume of us   million in september likewise the oil company had the highest price increase with  according to andres moreno a stock market analyst colombias market capitalization moves at the rate of ecopetrol because it weighs  of the stock market due to the rebound in the companys share where in one year it went from   to almost   the positive variation in market capitalization is explained and it is that in the last five reports of the mila ecopetrol has been the most traded instrument and in august it also had the highest increase according to moreno this is due to the increases in wti and brent oil prices in the year as reported by lr in september ecopetrols share rose to   thus recovering the levels of the issue that took place in  however the price of oil begins to show strong volatility and the final price which these days is moving at around us   per barrel it has moved within distant margins of about us   per barrel up to high levels somewhat above us   a barrel in other words the market capitalization will be guided by the behavior of the oil that will control ecopetrols action on the other hand that mexico and chile are ahead of us is because we have very few issuers of which ecopetrol represents the majority we have the fewest number of financial intermediaries and operations within mila have been very few no broker offers you shares from the chilean peruvian or mexican stock market it has not worked because of the exchange and tax issues and the different laws in each country explained moreno finally the instrument with the greatest drops during september was grupo argos  for moreno this was due to two reasons the first was that one of its majority partners which was an international investment fund harbor warned about its possible exit which in recent weeks happened the second reason was the drop in the price of cement and corruption issues in various infrastructure works in the report the countries of the pacific alliance also agreed to study common cybersecurity principles to consider for their financial systems and capital marketssuperfinanciera attends to request of ecopetrol shareholders and seeks to reduce costs last friday the financial superintendency launched external circular  which is part of the sectors intention to reduce the costs of managing securities in order to reduce costs for investors and attract more investment the norm allows a reduction in the costs that the commission agents involve in operations for investors of smaller amounts for this the category of investments with low transactionality was created for portfolios of natural persons who have not operated in the last year with which only the affiliation form has to be updated reducing costs by reducing the updating processes basically the circular facilitates customer engagement processes since the operator does not have to constantly update the information of its customer but only when it is going to operate said financial superintendent jorge castano the official also added that transactions of less than  uvr are not necessary to be put on the stock market so their operation may be facilitated with the creation of the category of lowamount brokerage operations we made a commitment this year with the ecopetrol shareholders meeting that in this years regulations we would lower rates and we have already defined it they are already in force and we hope that for this issuer and many others it will be beneficial they can already apply it with its investors  superfinanciera will develop a survey on green finance the superfinanciera will launch a survey at the end of the year to review how entities in the sector are doing in terms of green finance this was announced by the superintendent jorge castano during the ii international congress of financial markets organized by the faculty of administration of the university of los andes this is called a climate change risk survey and report generation and aims to support green finance and the development of the green bond market once the superfinanciera has joined the ifc sustainable banking network the results of this are expected in march and depending on what it shows the possibility of carrying it out on a regular basis could be reviewed in order to generate an update diagnosis of the entities in this matter the global market is taking advantage of the alternative financing opportunities presented by an economy based on green growth castano said when commenting on the novelty agility the challenge of the financial system the superintendent commented that  of financial consumers prefer to acquire an informal loan noting that they choose it due to the speed of disbursement the formal system must address these needs if the consumer today is not finding the agility he needs in the system for this technology is key castano added that in order to improve service times the entity works on omnichannel because the offices are being used less and less today the offices are used by  while the users that are linked via internet are  by mobile telephony  and correspondents  said the officialaes chivor will build ecopetrols selfgeneration power plant the company aes chivor confirmed that it will be responsible for the construction of an ecopetrol selfgenerating solar plant which would become the largest in the country with these characteristics the project seeks to supply energy to campo castilla land owned by the oil company in total the solar park was thought with a capacity of  mw which according to aes chivor is equivalent to the consumption corresponding to  homes we hope that this is not only the first but one of many great projects that we have in mind for colombia said federico echavarria general manager of aes chivor the area available for its construction is  hectares in which the installation of approximately  solar panels is planned we hope that this relationship will deepen and extend over time with a view to fulfilling the shared objective of having a diversified and sustainable energy matrix concluded echavarria regarding its operation in colombia this company highlighted the

limoncovenas oil pipeline one of the main infrastructures of ecopetrols energy sector located in the municipality of saravena in arauca the attack would have been carried out with explosive charges that once again deteriorated the pipeline after being recently repaired the commander of the quiron task force brigadier general alvaro vicente perez duran indicated that the events occurred at

the fall in the price of oil related article  drop in a barrel took the dollar to highs that were not recorded  months ago on friday international prices per barrel of brent and wti registered falls of more than  reaching respectively us   and us   even in the morning they were close to us   for the second reference values that had not been seen for  months in this way the accumulated for the week reaches a drop of  as is normal when prices begin to show bearish signals questions are raised about the impact on revenues and profits of the sector in companies such as ecopetrol terpel and canacol however although the market expects the trend to continue next week these values would not strongly affect the results of the fourth quarter nor the budgets of the companies in the sector which are being conservative when making projections with prices close to us   and that at the end of september were the ones that led the rise in revenues canacol rose  ecopetrol  and terpel  for the strategy director of adcap securities otman gordillo this year there has been less dependence on crude oil due to plans to face strong falls the companies made adjustments to seek increased efficiency and that was transmitted to better levels of income although oil suffers lower losses the hit in profits at the end of the year would not be as aggressive as before he said as reported by bloomberg during the week the price falls were the result of the increase in production in the united states and the unexpected decision of donald trump to allow the buyers of iranian oil to continue their purchases adding an unexpected supply at the same time the saudis have indicated that they are producing at a record rate  now despite the fact that the market does not see the balance sheets of colombian companies in danger for the end of the year the shares had a slight decline with an intraday decline of  in ecopetrol and  in canacol with these losses for the month the oil companys share returned to august levels here analysts highlight that more than  minority partners achieved profits when selling when it reached   for its part in the american union there was a storm as the s   fell  despite being a short day for black friday the effect was because devon energy corp and marathon oil felt the effect and stocks fell almost  the next opec meeting will be on december  in vienna and on that day it will be determined whether arabia and the allies will reduce the  production as a journalist from the wall street journal anticipated that they would be thinking of doing it there could also be a series of atypical meetings after the date which would impact the securities but due to time issues not yet with high severity said camilo thomas analyst at alianza valoresecopetrol will invest between us   billion and us   billion in  ecopetrol reported this tuesday that in  it plans to invest between us   billion and us   billion which represents an increase of between  and  compared to the estimated figure for  this was confirmed by the entity through a statement in which it ensures that the plan approved by the board of directors is aimed at ensuring the growth and consolidation strategy of the company with an efficient profitable and safe operation investments have been prioritized with a lens of capital discipline and are focused on ensuring the future sustainability of the company by increasing hydrocarbon reserves and production he stated in the text in addition he explained that the plan was built with an expectation of brent price in a range of us   to us   per barrel the equilibrium price at which the company would generate positive net profit in  remains around us   per barrel which shows the resilience of the company to fluctuations in the oil price cycle the plan maintains the objective of ensuring an average return on capital employed roace of more than  which will keep ecopetrol as one of the companies with the highest value generation among its peers he added on the other hand in line with strategic priorities of the gee the plan is focused on the disciplined growth of the exploration and production segment to which  of total investments will be allocated which will allow production to reach a level of between  and  barrels of oil equivalents per day oil and gas and the incorporation of proven reserves equivalent to  of oil and gas production as for the barrancabermeja and cartagena refineries the projection is that they process between  and  barrels equivalent per day the growing integration between the two refineries and the evaluation of profitable opportunities that enable a greater supply of clean fuels to the country will continue the company explained on the other hand ecopetrol assured that  will be a year of greater activity in the different areas of operation the drilling of more than  development wells of at least  exploratory wells in the continental territory of colombia the acquisition of more than  thousand kilometers of seismic and the development of  improved recovery pilots stand outecopetrols investment will increase between  and  next year between us   million and us   million the ecopetrol group will allocate for the growth and consolidation strategy of the company next year between  and  more than the estimated investment for  according to felipe bayon president of ecopetrol this investment plan confirms the companys commitment to colombia and will continue to prioritize efficiency and discipline there has been a good part of ecopetrols transformation in recent years which today allows us to successfully face the volatility of international oil prices and generate profits with a brent starting at us   per barrel he mentioned growth is focused on exploration and production to which  of total investments will be allocated with these resources production is expected to reach a level of between  and  barrels of oil equivalent per day and the incorporation of proven reserves equivalent to  of oil and gas production between january and september of this year on average  barrels of oil equivalent were produced per day regarding the operation the oil company plans to drill more than  development wells and at least  onshore exploratory wells in colombia in addition more than  kilometers of seismic will be acquired and  improved recovery pilots will be developed of the resources  will be invested in colombia where capital is included to mature the initiatives related to a pilot project for unconventional hydrocarbons in magdalena medio part of these resources would also be used for the evaluation and development of gas discoveries on the caribbean coast the rest of the investment will be used in projects in the united states brazil and mexico the colombian economy will continue to benefit from a solid ecopetrol in  which will display great activity in the national territory to increase its production and reserves while continuing the integration of its two refineries increasing its participation in renewable energies and continuing to improve the fuels that it delivers to all colombians said bayon regarding refineries next year the average load level in barrancabermeja is expected to be  barrels per day while in cartagena it will be  barrels per day the company anticipates improvements in refining margins with load maximization crude optimization and higher expected yields from valuable products the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol we will not lower our guard on efficiencies and discipline a good part of ecopetrols transformation has been there in recent years  investments in oil infrastructure will increase  compared to this year as the quantity transported would be proportional to production expectations and a higher demand for refined products this investment plan was built with an expectation of a brent price between us   and us   per barrel diego franco president of franco group believes that it is feasible that in  the price of a barrel is in this range and even considers that the prices estimated by the oil company are quite conservative the correction we are seeing in prices is temporary and corrects the excess that had occurred until october he saidcompanies that are committed to improving their processes in favor of the environment making its processes more sustainable reducing its impact on the environment has been the commitment of companies such as ecopetrol grupo agroindustrial riopaila castilla pintuco and promigas these entities are currently leading programs aimed at reducing water consumption ecoefficiency and the protection of flora and fauna among the initiatives of ecopetrol for example the incursion into its first solar operation project in the department of meta stands out a work that will begin construction in the first half of  in the municipality of castilla la nueva the incursion into largescale solar energy projects marks a milestone in the history of ecopetrol which is added to other developments to have a more diversified and clean energy matrix which contributes to protecting the environment and ensuring energy security of colombia  stated felipe bayon president of ecopetrol it is worth noting that the entity is committed to comprehensive environmental management and that is why it works from three main axes comprehensive management of water resources since august  it has been publicly committed to sustainable water management through its adherence to the mandate for water initiative promoted by the united nations global compact ceo water mandate the other axis of the environmental strategy is ecoefficiency ecopetrols energy strategy is aimed at achieving energy selfsufficiency and considers different possibilities for diversification regarding climate change thanks to the projects launched in  a reduction in greenhouse gases ghg of  tons of  equivalent was achieved exceeding the established goal of  tons according to the company on water issues in   million cubic meters of water were reused equivalent to  of the total water required to operate for its part the riopaila

and expectations of opec cuts oil prices fell more than  this thursday with the tensions generated by the meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec in which further cuts in its crude supply for  will be decided the fall was due to that after the meeting of countries in vienna austria it was known that the cuts would be below what the market expected because while it waits for decreases of up to  million barrels of oil per day bdp these would be of maximum one million bpd according to saudi arabias energy minister khalid alfalih these drops which left wti oil at a price of us   per barrel and brent at us   directly affected ecopetrols shares which fell  in their local price and  in the new york stock exchange today it is expected that after a new opec meeting in which russia and allies will participate a reduction agreement will be reached for  why the cuts the need to make cuts is something new that appeared since the revision of opecs projections in october explained cristian cruz a currency and commodities analyst at corficolombiana and it is precisely in its report for that month the organization projected lower growth in the global economy so the current excess production would lead to a clash between supply and demand here it is key to note that opecs pumping has grown  since the middle of  and in september they achieved a production of  million led by arabia see graph in addition limiting production may lessen effects such as the one seen in  when the production of saudi arabia russia and opec was equivalent to  of global consumption it is estimated that between opec and its allies about  million bpd may be being produced so there are expectations that this offer will decrease between  million bpd and  million which will depend on russia the contrasts juan david ballen head of economic research brokerage firm the idea would be that the fiscal issue would not depend so much on crude oil to this is added that the dollar can be affected and the debt rises  julio cesar vera president of acipet what is decided today is important not only for the income of the countrys treasury but also for the profits that are distributed with royalties cristian cruz commodities analyst at corficolombiana what has been seen from september to today may be a picture of the volatility expected for  crude oil may see recoveries by sections waiting for the soviets determination of the cuts rests largely with what russian energy minister alexander novak discussed with his president before traveling to the meeting opec has explained that they could reduce production by one million bpd if russia contributes  bpd whereas if it contributes close to  bpd the general cut could exceed  million bpd and meet the market local impact and volatility the only thing guaranteed by the outlook so far is that a year of high volatility for crude is coming this was pointed out by juan david ballen head of economic investigations at casa de bolsa the analyst develops that a low cut would be somewhat problematic because it would lower the price of crude oil which is already below that stipulated by the countrys financial plan us   per barrel of brent and does not have a high room for maneuver this would generate a new fiscal gap and rating agencies including moodys see reasons to reduce colombias credit profile cruz shares this vision and added that next year there will be extremely high volatility in the market so it is not unusual for crude oil to fetch us   one day and   another month in a game of expectations julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers pointed out that what is decided today will be important for the country and the income that oil generates as well as the distribution of royalties for the departments the official pointed out that in the event that the expected cuts are not achieved or are not made effective a brent could be expected below us   and a wti below us   for his part edgar jimenez professor of finance at the jorge tadeo lozano university commented that the narrow difference between supply and demand would cause the equilibrium price to be below us   for the wtinational hydrocarbons agency confirmed that colombia is ready for fracking pilots after ten years of working on robust regulation to start exploratory projects in unconventional fields colombia is ready to start with the pilots this was announced by luis miguel morelli navia president of the national hydrocarbons agency anh we are awaiting the conclusions of the expert commission created by the ministry of mines and energy together with the ministry of environment and social development and the decision of the national environmental licensing agency anla to start with the pilots reported according to morelli navia there are already nine contracts signed with national and foreign companies such as ecopetrol conocophilips exxonmovil and drummond among others which are focusing their investment in the middle magdalena valley basin and the cesar rancheria basin in other words santander cesar and la guajira would be the three pilot departments the debate should be given according to morelli navia the nonconventional fields ync represent a great opportunity for the country to guarantee its oil selfsufficiency for many years currently colombia has less than  million barrels of reserve crude that lasts for  years with an average consumption of  million barrels per year with ync the reserves would increase to  million barrels it is important to give the debate from the scientific point of view so that the community is calm that this activity can take place with due respect for the environment and does not represent a risk for the contamination of the aquifers nor will it negatively impact the community neighbor of the deposits  said the director who said that the refusal is due more to the lack of knowledge and the stigmatization that the exploration activity has suffered what happened to the outcrop of crude oil in the lisama  well regarding the outcrop of crude in the lisama  well last march the president of the anh affirmed that ecopetrol has given a piece of reassurance in relation to overcoming the emergency as well as the safety of other wells information that the authorities environmental and control are verifying from the anh we are monitoring the activities and inactive wells that have not been closed definitively so that the operating companies close and abandon from the technical point of view

foz de amazonas potiguar and ceara basins strengthening its exploration portfoliogo back and play the price of oil the relationship of the colombian economy with oil prices is like an eternal deja vu only as of august  we realized the high dependence that the national coffers have on the export of crude oil just when the economy came to a halt and saw how the countrys finances were stripped down by the bad situation which swept by the way ecopetrols numbers in an unprecedented situation but which in the end was well sorted leaving a deep mark on the growth figures this year things seemed to improve a bit and it was loudly celebrated that a barrel of crude could reach us   something that never happened in  and that seems to drift away until well into next year yesterday crude oil fell  due to new signs of excess supply in the united states production and the markets concern about lower world economic growth that would lead to a decrease in the demand for fuels the outlook for colombia is starting to be scary again as a barrel of brent fell  to a price of us   and the us benchmark crude wti saw its lowest level since september  trading at us    after falling  our country sells oil under the two references but it is brent that is used to make the budgets prepared for ecopetrol at around us   and for state revenues at us   in a few moments in the recent history of crude oil has depended so much on what happens with us inventories in particular with the storage in cushing oklahoma that it has become a great reference and yesterday increased by more than a million barrels  both references have begun to fall to reach  a situation that occurs from the beginning of october to the end of november due to the global excess supply the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec recently announced supply cuts of  million barrels per day from january to move prices up a situation seconded by other nonopec producers such as russia but despite the constant pressures for the market to react the price of fuel has not been able to stabilize at the ceiling of us   the problem is structural for colombia and nothing different from that it depends on oil exports not only to improve its finances but the national government has a source of income in ecopetrol similar to income from taxes characteristics that have not been possible change in recent decades despite the diagnoses and criticism of the high dependence on crude oil the  oil price crisis led the national economy to be aware of living in a kind of undeclared dutch disease since all growth and the generality of economic sectors were affected by the fall in value of the oil barrel no plans were made to support nontraditional exports or to take advantage of more than a dozen free trade agreements signed by the country in the last decade plus a good exchange rate thus colombia is once again in the same situation of dependence on oil prices because it has failed to transform the economythe reduction in the production of liquefied petroleum gas would increase the price by  in the first half of next year the national supply of liquefied petroleum gas lpg from ecopetrols barrancabermeja refinery will be reduced by  so the company will have  tons per month for sale according to estimates by the colombian lpg association gasnova this change in availability would imply an  increase in the price to the end user faced with this decrease in the supply produced locally and considering that the domestic market demand is close to  tons the ministry of mines and energy issued the draft resolution by which programmed rationing of liquefied petroleum gas lpg and other provisions are dictated  although from the name it seems that the ministry is promoting rationing to avoid the shortage of lpg in reality the purpose of the document is to allow ecopetrol to make additional imports of between  and  tons per month in the first semester to compensate for the deficit in the domestic market it is worth mentioning that the private sector currently has the capacity to import  tons per month alejandro martinez villegas president of gasnova estimates that imports of this fuel will go from representing  of demand to  of it imported lpg is more expensive because it must be transported from the gulf of mexico to the colombian coast and then by tank car to the center of the country he mentioned the union estimates that bringing fuel from the international market will affect the producers income of   per kilogram and that taking the product from reficar to the interior of the country will cost   per kilogram therefore the price for the end user in the interior of the country would increase by   per kilogram the contrasts alejandro martinez villegas president of the colombian lpg association gasnova the price of lpg is very elastic for  million people who use it for cooking if the price increases they will switch to cooking with firewood which affects health  an ecopetrol spokesperson stressed that the country does not have a risk of shortages since not only are there imports but it is expected that in the fourth quarter of another year the cupiagua field will also come into operation which would produce more than  barrels per day  the state company reduced its lpg production because it increased the production of gasoline and diesel with low sulfur contents in order to comply with the conpes for fuel qualityecopetrol announced the retirement of carlos vargas from the vice presidency of transformation the state company ecopetrol announced today through a statement that carlos alberto vargas medina has made the decision to retire from the company and from his position as vice president of transformation effective january  of

when the first public offering of ecopetrol shares was made the stock market in colombia celebrated with euphoria the arrival of  new partners to the oil company which helped multiply by  times the number of investors of shares in just  years going from  in  to about  in  a figure that was also boosted with other new share issues during that time range such as those of grupo aval  and  isa   and   etb  and isagen  later in  the second issue of ecopetrol shares was made where the company reached the number of  partners which made the stock market helped by about  new issues and registrations of different companies achieve a little more than  participants equivalent to  of the population in colombia since  the number of investors in the stock market had increased their number by  times a very appreciable growth in  years few would imagine that this growing trend in investors would change dramatically over the next few years from  to september  the equity market has lost about  investors of which  have left ecopetrol losing  of its partners which is equivalent to  of the total number of people who have massively gone out of the bag to top it off as of september  there were  investors in the stock market of which  with  shareholders are from ecopetrol and of them  that is  partners of the oil company have less than  shares that are equivalent to an investment portfolio of less than   million share price of   at the end of  there will be  years of massive departure of investors which has affected the interest of new participants in the stock market the liquidity of the market and the formation of prices of most shares the worst thing is that for the year  there are no changes in this trend and if ecopetrols participation is excluded the variable income market will fall in number of participants to the levels of  the stock brokers themselves have focused their commercial strength and a sales strategy towards other products such as collective investment funds fics abandoning the promotion of the stock market in individuals with low amounts the minority shareholders of ecopetrol and the rest of the companies sell their shares en masse and leave the market fleeing from high administration fees and no level of advice due to having lowervalue portfolios although the financial superintendency issued external circular no  with the purpose of promoting and addressing problems inherent to the stock market and fostering the access of small investors to stock market products more measures are lacking to promote the equity market  the capital market mission has the great challenge of analyzing the causes of this massive exile of investors from the stock market in colombia such as the high costs of managing portfolios and transactions for minority shareholders intermittent advisory services technological deficiencies and lack of education financial and stock market culture in the population likewise they will have the task of suggesting the pertinent measures to attract new investors to the stock market in addition the improvement and application of corporate governance of companies listed on the stock exchange should be scrutinized the corruption and bribery scandals in issuers linked to the infrastructure sector and the public sector adding the scarce incidence that minority partners have in shareholders meetings and in company decisions make people prefer to leave the capital market by not feeling supported or represented it is worth asking the stock market and stock market directives in colombia are you interested in deepening the stock market in terms of issuers intermediaries and investors this matter is no longer waitingecopetrol increased its stake in brazil after sealing an alliance with shell and chevron the

new energy to the indebted oil company pemex with a bigger budget but paradoxically he has proposed that the state giant pay even more taxes next year if the proposal of the leftist government of

rate hikes from the us federal reserve increased the appetite for less volatile assets and led to outflows of foreign investors in stocks at the local level this phenomenon was reflected in the difference between the average amount negotiated for each operation in the main securities when comparing the  figures of the superfinanciera with those of  as a result of the influence of foreigners it is not by chance that the shares of the colombian stock exchange the preferencial grupo aval the preferencial grupo argos and the ordinary of grupo sura are among those that grew the most when comparing their average amount traded between the two years see graph omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa commented that colcap has been having a selling flow of the shares of natural persons and a greater participation of pension administrators and foreigners actors that with mechanisms such as fics they move the highest amount on the local stock market when analyzing the  marketability index the bvc title appears as the one that saw the greatest variation in its traded amounts  his entrance to the colcap explains part of the story however it was also key that amber its fifth largest shareholder sold its share another different case is that of the preferential share of grupo aval according to analysts there are two factors that led to the trading amounts being  higher than the immediately previous year these effects are the media issue that the ruta del sol ii scandal has meant for grupo aval to which it is added that the action saw the effects of the departure of the international investor harbor explained carlos rodriguez director of variable income of ultraserfinco the titles of grupo argos grupo sura and cemargos were the ones that saw a greater shock after the departure of harbor de colombia species in which the fund was located as one of the main investors and holders the weight of harbor became such that it represented  of the total foreign investment in shares in the country this figure is more relevant when reviewing that for march   of the colcap index was held by foreigners which represented  of the total float ecopetrols share also saw an increase in the average amount traded  the stock market analyst andres moreno commented that the exit of a large number of natural investors who are much stronger in this title was key here these sales occurred for the most part when the stock had a variation in its price in a range close to   so funds came to buy as seen in november etb was also among the most traded after the sale of ambers securities for the equivalent of   million the contrasts carlos rodriguez director of equities at ultraserfinco in  foreign investors such as harbor international left which generated a greater flow in some stocks omar suarez manager of brokerage house equities there are agents with a greater participation that generate larger operations this does not mean that the number of transactions will increase on the other hand among the shares that decreased their trading volume the most during the past year are some of the same companies that are outlined at the beginning of the index that is the case of grupo avals ordinary  and the preferential securities of cementos argos  and grupo sura  this is generated because foreign funds had no participation in these species or it was very low their decline occurred in part because they are species that are at historic lows such as conconcreto or at lows of several years such as grupo aval and banco de bogota it should be noted that in the course of  three grupo aval shares were among the six that reached minimumsbancolombia the one that would lose the most participation in the february colcap rebalancing on january

the company estimates that the highest sales will come from bancolombia with a total of   million in its preferred share and   million in its ordinary kind this being the case the former would decrease its participation in the index by  percentage points pps while that of the latter would fall by  pps being the only ones expected to decrease we emphasize that this decrease is due to the fact that we are adjusting the total weight of the issuer to  given the limit per issuer according to the methodology ultraserfinco said according to the analysis ecopetrol would lead the index with a percentage of  followed by preferencial de bancolombia with  and grupo sura with a  sharecolombia registered  drills in operation in december  a campetrol report revealed that  drills were in

although the general consolidated on oil production by department is not yet available as of august  the five main departments meta casanare santander arauca and putumayo contributed  of the total

explained campetrol in its report ministry of finance contemplates sale of  of ecopetrol finance minister alberto carrasquilla announced that the government is contemplating the sale of  of ecopetrols shares the official recalled that congress had already approved this action although the idea has yet to be discussed with president ivan duque law  of  ensures that the government cannot have less than  of the share ownership of ecopetrol therefore in private hands there cannot be more than  in  and  emissions were made for  in other words there is a legal option to offer another  at this time the oil company has a valuation close to   billion in the colombian stock exchange this means that if  of the company is sold it would represent an income for the government close to   trillion that is about  of colombias gdp currently the majority of ecopetrols shares are owned by the government with  of shareholders from state entities which is equivalent to  papers followed by  of minority shareholders another participant is jpmorgan which has a  stake and porvenir which has  of the total shares ecopetrol is the share that has the largest participation in the basket of the bvcs main stock index colcap with a participation of  at the time of the announcement the stock started the day with a value of   and in the few hours of trading the title fell  to   despite todays announcement by the government in december president duque announced that he was not looking to sell it but rather to strengthen it two days ago i was in a forum where we were talking about the importance of ecopetrol for colombia this company is carried by all colombians in our hearts and there are some people who have launched proposals to sell the entire company and i want to say that it will continue to be owned by all colombians because we are not thinking about its total sale said duque one month ago related article fasecolda presented a proposal for the sale of ecopetrol del estado shares the idea of selling part of ecopetrol was born in the middle of last year after jorge humberto botero president of the federation of colombian insurance companies fasecolda presented the proposal at that time the manager clarified that this measure was taken with the objective of releasing resources from oil revenues and substituting assets from the public patrimony for others to impact national economic growth over a long cycle and therefore employment with the money that is expected to be obtained from this sale of shares botero also explained that it could continue to finance road infrastructure projects that allow the countrys competitiveness to be boosted the document presented by the president of fasecolda spoke of the possibility of create a fund because after the sale the resources from the dividends of the oil company would be lost juan pablo cordoba president of the colombian stock exchange had also spoken about this possibility in the framework of the xi fiap congress and asofondos of the year past there is a space to sell part of the company the approach is that for this new fiscal path it is possible to talk about a management of assets and liabilities that would incorporate the sale of some of the nations shares it could be ecopetrol or other investments made by the nation  he explained cordoba added at that time that the operation would help reduce debt give additional resources to the government and have more manageable margins from the fiscal point of view the history of the disposal at the end of  the first public offering of ecopetrol shares was made which allowed the arrival of  new partners to the oil company which helped multiply by  times the number of investors of shares in the stock exchange de valores de colombia in just eight years going from  in  to about  in  later in  the second issue of ecopetrol shares was made where the company reached the number of  partners which made the stock market helped by about  new issues and registrations from different companies will have a little more than  participants despite this the market has seen a flight of minority investors from  to september  the equity market has lost about  investors of which  have left ecopetrol losing  of its partners which are equivalent to  of the total of people who have come out of the bag en masse as of september  there were  investors in the stock market of which  with  shareholders are from ecopetrol and of them  that is  partners of the oil company have less than  sharesthe possible sale of  of ecopetrols shares would be good for the market the possible sale of  of ecopetrols shares is one of the cards that the national government will put on the table to guarantee the fiscal stability of the country this decision although it has yet to go to ministerial consideration and presidential approval could not only sit well with the nation but also with the market selling this share percentage would add to another of the oil companys milestones in the possible scenario that this is achieved ecopetrol would continue with an  shareholding since among other things the nation today has a participation of  after two share disposal processes were carried out  and  where it offered  of its titles despite the voices for and against this decision is within the regulatory framework this is indicated by law  of  which authorized the oil company to issue shares to be placed on the market under a single condition the nation must keep at least  of the titles that are in circulation one way to mitigate this impact is by generating additional resources through the recomposition of the governments business or investment portfolio in this context the operation that the ministry announces with a percentage of ecopetrol shares for which there is already authorization from congress is a very good idea  explained jorge humberto botero president of fasecolda and who put on the table this discussion last year the sale of this  would equate to the process that was carried out  years ago  at this time the company opened the first sale round and offered  million shares a figure that represented the sale of  of the companys stake andres moreno stock exchange expert assured that in that year the nation collected   billion this money eased public finances and boosted investment in the country in  by contrast only  of the shares were offered and about   trillion was collected the stock at that time was trading at    the sales of years ago meant that today a group of shares of the oil company is in charge of private parties and retailers in fact although ecopetrol retains the majority share  is in charge of private companies jp morgan chase porvenir proteccion among others and retailers for the president of the association of stock brokers jaime humberto lopez this movement would go down very well in the market not only because of the increase in liquidity but also because of the number of new investors that would enter the sale of ecopetrol shares can automatically increase market liquidity by  or  so it is positive from the stock market point of view without any doubt lopez explained the manager also recalled that for now the procedures that will be carried out are key what we should not do is democratize ourselves excessively we could fall into what we have today and that is that when many people entered they did not understand the sector which generated a bad reputation on the capital market julio cesar vera president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet is also optimistic about the sale but assured that it is necessary to guarantee that the resources will be invested for now it is expected to decide whether or not there will be a sale of shares when analyzing how much income the sale of that  of the shares to the government would represent we would be talking about almost   trillion this taking into account that yesterday the company closed with a market capitalization of   billion one of the arguments that support this sale was the sale of isagen which left the state   billion of which   billion went to the national development finance and the rest to infrastructure projects in the departments from antioquia tolima caldas and santander what would be the steps to offer the shares according to the project presented by fasecolda the law establishes that the government must design a disposal program according to the regulations this will have to have the corresponding technical studies at the end of this process the project will be submitted to the council of ministers for consideration which after a favorable opinion will forward it to the president for approval subsequently this concept must be passed for the knowledge of the congress of the republicthere is the legal power to carry out the sale minister of mines and energy the possible sale of ecopetrols shares would not affect investments income or royalties that is what maria fernanda suarez minister of mines and energy believes clarifies that the ministry of finance must evaluate the economic benefit of the salethe minister highlights the corporate governance that the oil company has achieved and that was reinforced after colombias entry into the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd also remember that the government has the legal power to carry out the sale process after the authorization that congress gave in  will the sale of  of the shares that the government owns in ecopetrol be based on a conpes document or is it a discretionary decision of the ministry of finance the ministry of finance has stated that there are fiscal needs to continue guaranteeing essential social investments for the equity of the country investment in education health and infrastructure among others the owner of the nations shareholding in state or mixed economy companies is the ministry of finance and public credit when looking for sources of financing different alternatives are evaluated the ministry of finance has a diverse portfolio of investments in the mining and energy sector in the financial sector and in the telecommunications sector minister carrasquilla mentioned that ecopetrol is one of those alternatives however it will have to be discussed with president duque with due evaluation of fiscal and energy policy has minminas calculated how much it will stop receiving via dividends from the sale of that share percentage by reducing the participation of the nation to  the ministry of finance will evaluate the economic benefit of the sale against future dividends could the block of shares to be sold be bought by a single multinational oil company ecopetrol is today a competitive company with private capital and solid corporate governance with the entry into the oecd the ministers no longer participate in the organizations board of directors this corporate governance has been fundamental in the transformation of ecopetrol will this government decision affect the course of the miningenergy policy in  the energy mining sector was restructured and the different roles were separated from that moment on public policy is in charge of the ministry of mines and energy the administration of the hydrocarbon resource and allocation of areas in charge of the anh and the exploration and production in charge of ecopetrol later in  the congress of the republic authorized the national government to dilute its stake to  owned by ecopetrol therefore there is that legal power will this decision affect ecopetrols investment policy ecopetrol is a very important company for colombians the efficiency levels it has reached are world class and thanks to this it produces income dividends taxes and royalties that generate development for the country and the regionsecopetrol and preferencial bancolombia shares the most traded on the bvc on the last day of the week in which negotiations were carried out on the colombian stock exchange the colcap index closed with an intraday variation of  and  points during the market day the shares of ecopetrol and preferencial de bancolombia were the

value of   and also a negative behavior of  for its part the grupo bolivar species also presented a negative behavior on friday fell  closed at  ecopetrol reported an attack against the trasandino pipeline in narino the state oil company ecopetrol reported an attack on the trasandino pipeline in the village of pususquer  kilometers from the urban area of the municipality of mallama at the foot of the coastal hill of narino according to the company given that there was no crude pumping at the time the events occurred no major damage is reported at this time ecopetrol announced that once the area is secured the corresponding inspection work will be carried out during the day likewise it was learned that so far those responsible for the attack have not been identified by the authorities of ecopetrol must be sold the third week of the year was marked by two events of enormous relevance to the economy the first was the announcement by the minister of labor alicia arango to postpone until  the presentation to the congress of the republic of a pension reform which incidentally is a pending task that the three have had on their political agenda past presidents the second event which went unnoticed by the tragic suicide attack in bogota was the decision taken by the minister of finance alberto carrasquilla to dispose of the  that the national government has approved to sell of ecopetrol two fundamental announcements that clarify many things and reveal that the economic ministers of this government have a life of their own that they launch ideas and that it is up to the president ivan duque to accompany them or not with the respective collection account for their popularity regarding pensions there is no problem since it is an always unpopular issue since any reform must include an increase in the pension age and the reduction of subsidies to colpensiones beneficiaries what is a reality and excellent news for the economy  hopefully it will come true  is that the state puts  of the shares that ecopetrol has on the stock market which have already been approved for sale for years it is simply executing a pending alienation which will trigger a series of attacks from the opposition and again threats of stoppages sitins and the usual marches which almost never lead to anything good the panorama is as follows law  of  says that the government cannot have less than  of the share ownership of ecopetrol that is in private hands there cannot be more than  as it is considered a strategic national security company since then two issues have been made in  and  for  which means that there is a legal option to issue another  there are two ways to do it first make a capitalization as it happened in  and  a financial operation that has been ruled out by the new finance minister since the resources obtained would capitalize the joint venture the other way to do it is to sell the government shares so the money would go to the state coffers directly the problem is that it must be done under the mandate of law  which obliges the solidarity sector to make the offer first and nobody knows what could happen in that operation in a financial situation in which many companies from that sector are arriving it is an operation with different paths that will all lead to an improvement for the market the other question is how much is that  worth until last friday ecopetrols capitalization was approximately   billion a value that varies each day according to the movement of its shares on the colombian and new york stock exchanges where its adr is listed in addition to the traditional fluctuations in the price of oil which has been volatile in the last  weeks that means that  can cost about   trillion and even go up to   trillion depending on the conditions the amount is huge and can exceed  of gdp that money that can help with the deficit and would help postpone a new tax reform before the end of the governmentit takes  years for  of ecopetrol to leave   billion to the nation the   billion that the government would collect with the possible sale of  of ecopetrols shares was a debate that was put on the table last week by the minister of finance alberto carrasquilla in the possible scenario that the sale of securities is not achieved the nation would have two ways to obtain the money with other sources of financing or to wait more than  years for the dividends of only that share percentage to leave that amount to the country the reason why raising this money would take so long is because for example for  the colombian oil company distributed a total of   billion in dividends   billion for the nation for  of participation  and more than   million by  that private and retail companies have taking this figure as a reference it means that that  stake left   million in  therefore this stake would take  years to reach the   billion that would be obtained if the sale is made now although the variable in years is not exact since it varies depending on the volatility of the oil price and the companys investment plan this equation fits with the dividend projections that ecopetrol would leave in the coming years this was confirmed by andres moreno a stock exchange expert who clarified that for the government it is better to offer the shares now because it would receive good money to weigh the deficit of the state and not have to carry out a second tax reform in the coming years mario valencia spokesman for tax justice explained that that  means on average about   million a year that is an estimate that we have made in the last five years so when looking at it in financial terms it would take about  years to raise   billion  now the expert considered that the state loses more by selling than by leaving these shares because the main source of the states resources today is ecopetrol this sale would be for political gain and does not represent a significant amount for the government to make that decision explained valencia the contrasts mario valencia spokesperson for tax justice that  means on average about   million a year that is an estimate that we have made in the last five years the sale of this percentage for now is one of the most attractive options that the government has to finance infrastructure works and social programs if this sale were to take place this movement would join those carried out in  and  under the protection of law  of  which in general terms established that the nation must have at least an  participation in ecopetrol the idea must now be analyzed by the ministry of finance and must be approved by the president ivan duqueunion sindical obrera requests a meeting with duque to discuss the sale of  of ecopetrol the leader of the union sindical obrera edwin palma told dataifx at the end of the first meeting of the union with the directors of ecopetro that they will request a meeting with president ivan duque to present their arguments as to why to sell  of the company is inconvenient tomorrow we will be filing a letter in the narino palace in which we will request a meeting with president duque to express our arguments as to why this sale or this announcement is inconvenient since this taking into account that the minister of finance has stated that this requires the approval of the president of the republic the notice comes days after finance minister alberto carrasquilla announced that the government is contemplating the sale of  of ecopetrols shares at the time carrasquilla stated that law  of  ensures that the government cannot have less than  of the share ownership of ecopetrol therefore in private hands there cannot be more than  made emissions for  that is there is a legal option to offer another  the idea still has to be discussed with president ivan duque it should be remembered that the president said last year that i was in a forum where we were talking about the importance of ecopetrol for colombia we colombians carry this company in our hearts and there are some people who have launched proposals to sell the entire company and i want to say that it will continue to be owned by all

quarter rebalancing tomorrow the stock exchange will announce the previous basket of the first rebalancing of colcap in the year before announcing the official basket on january  which will determine the weight of each issuer in the index for the first quarter with effect between february  and april  given this some brokerage firms have made their bets and the common denominator in their calculations is the range of participation with which the bancolombia species will remain in order to comply with the composition rules analysts agree that the only shares that will have sales flows are those of the bank since at this time the sum of both  in the preferential and  in the ordinary exceeds the maximum of  of permitted participation in the index by issuer in the index there can only be  issuers and each one must have a maximum  of the participation whether it has one or two species explained carlos rodriguez ultraserfincos equity manager therefore bancolombia would have to leave  of the current share that it has left over so according to rodriguez there would have to be sales of   million for the preferential share and for   million for the ordinary one there are two factors to take into account in these rebalancing the first an increase in the share price that makes the issuer have a greater stake and the second a growth in its float which means greater liquidity and movement in the stock market for german cristancho economic research manager at davivienda corredores in this rebalancing there were no important corporate events that affect the float of any company so the variations in the share of the shares will correspond to the price change indeed bancolombias preferential share has seen a  increase in its price going from   to   since november  date of the previous rebalancing while the common share rose  going from   to   thus then the banks preferential share would go from having a participation of  to  according to the average according to analysts projections while the ordinary one would fall  percentage points down to  omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa commented that this is positive for the issuer since the shares that should see sales change hands which may mean a greater number of shareholders what happens if ecopetrol is sold the possible sale of  of ecopetrol contemplated by the ministry of finance would have a positive impact on rebalancing experts said the president of ultraserfinco paula paucar stressed that in general terms it is good for the market since it would increase ecopetrols liquidity and therefore that of the colombian market added to an inflow of international flows from both passive and active funds the executive highlighted that in the local colcap index ecopetrol would have a  stake which would continue to be one of the most important actions with bancolombia when it comes to investing in the country the contrasts paula paucar president of ultraserfinco if ecopetrol is sold it would have a  stake and would continue to be one of the most important when investing in colombia german cristancho manager of inv economic davivienda brokers for this rebalancing there were no events that affect the float the variations will correspond to the change in share price the same firm calculates that if the sale occurs the participation of the oil company in the index could weigh up to  because its float would increase by a large amount which today is  of colcap the distribution of  that would remain from their participation would largely increase to the other members of the index while it could be an opportunity for individuals to return to the colombian stock market according to paucar cristancho added that the sale could also bring a benefit to ecopetrols participation in the international msci and ftse indices which could improve the strength of colombian stocks for his part suarez warned that these benefits would be lost if the sale is made to a single agent since the movement of the shares would decrease banco de bogota would have key purchase flows as for the actions that should have purchase flows the analyzes of the firms are not so compatible however in them banco de bogota stands out as one of those that could see key acquisitions according to alianza valores the stock could see a purchase flow equivalent to  trading days based on its average volume

registered mentions of  companies in the  editions of the year the indicator is calculated by adding the number of times the name of the company appears in the lr index that is published every day on the back cover of the printed newspaper and in  bancolombia was the protagonist with  references the number of mentions of the bank was due to a large extent to the launches that the entity made directly as well as those it made through nequi or sufi and the movement that its shares had in march for example an article was published in which it was reported that the titles that had grown the most up to that moment in the colombian stock exchange corresponded to the bank which during that period presented a positive variation of   since it was quoted at   almost   above the value at the

andes in bogota has a postgraduate degree from inalde and a postgraduate degree on government business and the international economy from harvard university he has a masters degree in economics from lancaster university before being codirector of the issuer he was minister of agriculture and rural development of colombiacompanies that protect threatened fauna and flora species in the country one of the most important riches of the national geography is its variety of species both flora and fauna so much so that the country is the first in birds with  registered species it also occupies the first places in amphibians thanks to its  species and currently has the fourth most varied population of mammals in the world with  species among other figures in which colombia remains among the first world occupations however this reality has led to several species being threatened in the country according to figures from the ministry of the environment among flora and fauna there are already  threatened species in colombia of which  are currently counted as critically endangered that is they are facing an extremely high risk of extinction in wildlife  endangered understood as those whose risk of extinction in wildlife is very high and  in a state of vulnerability which suffer from a high risk of disappearing faced with this the ministry commands a series of projects to protect flagship species of national ecosystems such as the andean condor sea turtles the plains alligator or felines independent associations are also working for the preservation of these species and additionally private associations contribute their grain of sand so that the country maintains its biodiversity and generalized natural wealth one of the companies involved in animal protection is ecopetrol the oil company with the iguana logo has a program under which  endangered species are protected among which is the companys emblematic reptile the oil company chaired by felipe bayon was part of the wildlife project which in a first stage between  and  focused on improving the living conditions for  species in magdalena medio and in the orinoquia since last year the program was resumed with the incorporation of five additional species native to putumayos own ecosystems currently the project is being carried out to ensure the protection in the magdalena medio area of the striped catfish the brown spider monkey the caribbean manatee the bluebilled paujil and the red cart tree regarding the work that is carried out in the eastern plains in the orinoco sector there are the tapir the moriche palm and the conger tree the species that entered the second stage of the project in the putumayo area were the pink cedar tree the black tinamu the tigrillo the churuco monkey and the whitelipped peccary species are chosen considering the concept of threat and complementarity and logically that they are specific to the territories first it is determined which are the threatened species present in the area to be intervened then they are selected considering that they use different habitats which have importance in the ecosystem that they are recognized by the communities and face threats in the territory the objective is that the mixture of species contributes to the integral conservation of the entire landscape and the functioning of the ecosystems  clarified santiago martinez manager of ecopetrols environmental performance as explained by the ministry of the environment the different species that inhabit the colombian territory such as those previously highlighted suffer from various threats to their conservation among which are illegal trafficking introduction of exotic species expansion of the agricultural frontier transformation and habitat fragmentation and climate change another evil that afflicts wildlife animals in the country is mixing with peoples lives since more and more buildings are approaching areas where animals were developed this was explained by maria camila villegas director of conservation of the fundacion grupo argos one of the large companies that has initiatives with animals to prevent this reality from costing the lives of species such as the andean bear we have reached more than  conservation agreements with the farmers of the area where what we have achieved is that they can achieve more sustainable productive projects and leave parts of their plots for forest villegas explained the intention of this initiative is that when an andean bear activity is close to that of society they are not killed by shots from the inhabitants of the area but wider corridors are generated for the species without interfering with issues like cattle thanks to this effort in alliance with smurfit kappa and environmental protection entities in these populations there is a robust diagnosis to know if the presence of these animals has increased or decreased and the answer is that it has remained at similar figures in addition to this the foundation is working on another similar project with species of jaguars and pumas present in antioquia however the situation is more complex with felines since unlike bears they do go in search of prey so they can affect the cows of the inhabitants of the area in terms of training its employees the drummond company conducts constant training in the country on why the presence of certain animals in the environments in which they work is important so that together with its employees they are preserved organizations such as national natural parks maintain constant monitoring to detail species found in protected areas to generate prevention and control scenarios penalties for those who damage habitats currently a person who is proven to violate the habitat of one of these species or directly to an animal can receive punishments represented in sentences of between  and  months in prison another of the most common ways of attacking ecosystems is by conserving wildlife in homes which has led to the illegal trafficking of species affecting more than  types of birds  of mammals  of reptiles and nine of amphibiansisa and ecopetrol were the

generating revenues of us   billion at the end of the year according to forbes the sharp reduction in net income is mainly caused by the negative impact on income from exchange differences and derivatives associated with debt in dollars said the research team sura is one of the most recognized companies abroad which could offset the drop in its profits according to experts its activity in mexico was able to stop the decline in earnings sura had a more than remarkable performance during  in mexico thanks to its consolidation as one of the main afores in the market for the quotation of

ecopetrols shareholders meeting will be held on march  today the financial results corresponding to the  fiscal year of ecopetrol were presented in which it was revealed that the net profit reached by the company was   billion the highest in the last five years likewise the company registered its highest ebitda in history which was established at   billion regarding the ebitda margin this was positioned at  let us remember that for fiscal year  these figures had been   trillion and  respectively the capital discipline and the efficiency plan fundamental pillars of our strategy and entrenched in our business culture are generating new and solid dynamics in all the companys processes this is evidenced by the results of the operational and commercial strategies that we undertook throughout the year said felipe bayon president of ecopetrol the company was satisfied to reach an annual production for last year  barrels of oil equivalent per day despite the public order issues that took place at the beginning of the year during the fiscal year of last year the company integrated  million barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves reaching  million barrels of oil equivalent in terms of net proved reserves regarding the average life of the total reserves  years were reached while taking into account only the crude reserves this statistic was established in the range between  and  years during the past year ecopetrol invested us   trillion which represented  more compared to the year immediately before of this money  was executed in the country while the other  went to operations in the gulf of mexico brazil mexico and peru  of the total invested was concentrated in matters related to exploration and production in terms of exports asia was one of the most prevalent destinations representing  of crude exports thanks to this initiative the discount of the price of the crude oil basket with respect to brent decreased to   a significant improvement compared to the  registered in  explained bayon news in development leadership of the stock market from bavaria to ecopetrol the first half of the  century was a time when the stock market which began to operate on april   promoted several industrial companies such as bavaria and acerias paz del rio which at the beginning of the century had managed to grow by accumulating small capitals this took place despite the ups and downs that the great depression generated in the bogota stock exchange and the fall in international coffee prices which in the  affected the economy in the same way that oil does today only in the first year of operation   million were managed to move and despite the fact that with the decline in coffee negotiations fell  going from   million in  to   million in  in  thanks to the quota system for exporting countries and the import limitation program there was an increase in the means of payment which improved stock market activity it was a tool that at the time managed to promote  commercial companies banks financial services companies and manufacturing commercial and service companies among the names there are still financial entities such as banco de bogota banco de colombia and banco aleman antioqueno today itau according to experts much of the boost came from the fact that banks could not lend for more than  days so to seek capital for expansion companies looked for less risky financing mechanisms that did not imply giving up control of operations in case of not fulfilling the loans of such short term in addition within the limits of government policies the economists francy barrios and carlos beltran highlight the double taxation law of  which delayed the dynamism of the market already in this second part of the  century according to roberto junguito the market has been a mechanism far below its potential that is why it has been decided to carry out capital market missions so that the market plays a more active role in boosting companies which have seen credit as a more active financing mechanism  the latter was improved in the  when the change in banking rules stood out which allowed longerterm loans according to records of the bogota stock exchange a share participation in the negotiations went from  in  to  in  when la republica was founded the bogota stock exchange functioned as a merger with the colombia stock exchange inaugurated in  with a capital of   and a year moved about   million according to figures from the bvc but it did not take long for other securities trading centers to be created taking into account the great reception it had had among the industrialists in the prime of antioquia companies in  the medellin stock exchange was created and later in  the western stock exchange was founded in cali this according to the book evolution analysis and perspective of the stock market as an investment option  decentralized the market and consolidated the antioquia industry as the axis for the capitalization and financing of the countrys industry however at the same time the policy of tax incentives to support firms through investment banks was strengthened which led to a decrease in capital injection by issuances and pushed credit as a financing mechanism from    to   while the emission fell from  to  in the  the rise in coffee generated a wave of inflation that affected the market as transactions in shares went from  in  to  in  while fixed income and exchange certificates grew it also mattered that there were very few issuers there were laws for public companies to enter and there were no large firms since the industry was just expanding said andres moreno a stock market analyst the contrasts roberto junguito former minister of finance in the second half of the  century it has been a mechanism that has been below its potential that is why the market missions were requested this behavior was maintained for years despite the improvements in the  with the operation of the three stock exchanges at the end of  there were  people investing where  were in bavaria and the rest in banbogota bancolombia and bbva mainly and it was at this point  where the boom of state companies arrived with ecopetrol and isa which gave a strong boost according to moreno ecopetrols was the largest expansion the number of participants multiplied by eight which brought a rise in share prices depth and with this greater interest in the market regarding the commission agents they have been impacted by the low levels of negotiation when the  century began there were  firms  on the bogota stock exchange and  between medellin and cali during the last  years dozens have been created merged and mostly liquidated which has led to only  active companies making it difficult for more than  million colombians to enterthe transformation that has been and will be to speak of the transformation that colombia has undergone in the last  years is to speak of the miningenergy sector the development of road infrastructure the arrival of television and the implementation of massive transportation systems  to name just a few milestones  have occurred thanks to mining electricity and hydrocarbons none of us would be able to charge our cell phone use the computer preserve food travel in private or public vehicles or travel by plane if there were no production of hydrocarbons and minerals and the generation of electricity the miningenergy sector has promoted other fundamental sectors for social and economic development it has transformed our daily lives and has generated employment investment tax revenues and opportunities for the country and the regions in these  years the pages of the newspaper la republica have recorded with depth analysis and journalistic rigor the evolution of the miningenergy sector both mining and the hydrocarbon sector and the electricity sector have had technological advances and institutional strengthening that added to the skills and commitment of human talent have been decisive in recent decades the contribution of this sector begins with the scientific knowledge of the subsoil and colombian geology thanks to the work of the colombian geological service which has been essential to know the potential of hydrocarbons and mineral resources this knowledge has been the basis for the structuring of coal gold nickel emerald projects among other sources of wealth for all colombians additionally on the issues of mass movement and volcanic activity significant progress has been made in the monitoring and study of these events in the energy transformation the sgc will study the geothermal potential that our country has as a new source of unconventional renewable energy in mining it is appropriate to recall the technical precariousness and the absence of security conditions that were identified in  by the first consolidated census of this industry in colombia the country went from almost nonexistent surveillance and accompaniment to having formalization programs and robust technical and environmental regulation the creation of the national mining agency put the experience and institutional capacity at the service of an adequate mining execution and inspection of titles the digital transformation process led by the anm which includes the digitization of  of mining files and the incorporation of satellite images to strengthen the inspection processes is just a sample of the advances that will put us at the forefront in the continent  on the other hand in the hydrocarbon sector significant changes were established to achieve greater efficiency of the institutions in  the sector was restructured and the different roles were separated from that moment on public policy is in charge of the ministry of mines and energy the administration of the hydrocarbon resource and the allocation of areas in charge of the national hydrocarbons agency and the exploration and production in charge of ecopetrol in competition with other national and foreign companies from a business point of view the milestones reached by ecopetrol since it was listed on the colombian stock exchange and the new york stock exchange are significant during the first stage it managed to transition from a state company to a mixed company implementing important changes in its corporate governance and in its association and investment policies thus its production grew from  to one million barrels per day in the last five years ecopetrol managed to be the direct operator of more than  barrels and emerged strengthened from the price crisis observed in the  period where several analysts classified it among the companies that made the greatest progress in efficiency passing its earnings equilibrium price of   to   per barrel today ecopetrol is one of the  most important companies in latin america and it will be your preponderance to continue making progress in its corporate governance and in preparing its strategy for the challenges of the energy transition in its first  years the colombian oil industry has been characterized by continuous evolution this industry continuously generates technological disruptions that have made it possible among others to go from drilling  meters deep in the initial wells of la cirainfantas the oldest field in the country to the gorgon well offshore with a depth of more than  meters and with a water surface of  meters as well as permanent advances in environmental and labor safety for its part in the electricity sector the energy rationing that occurred between  and  the largest in the recent history of the country prompted changes that have contributed to the formation of an increasingly solid sector law  of public services and electric law  in  represented a change in electricity policy that included the restructuring and modernization of the sector a free competition model was established and an alignment that has allowed a dynamic participation of the private sector for the provision of the service throughout the chain for its part the state must concentrate mainly on its role as director of public policy regulator and surveillance and control currently there is a strong institutional framework which includes entities such as the energy and gas regulation commission creg and the mining and energy planning unit upme this scenario has attracted greater investment and has consolidated a competitive sector as a result of the public and private leadership of the sector companies such as ecopetrol grupo de energia de bogota isa and celsia among others are among the companies with the highest market capitalization on the colombian stock exchange additionally among the  most profitable companies in the country there are at least seven in the electricity sector many have not only managed to be successful in colombia but have also expanded their operations to other american geographies as we have seen institutional strengthening and the use of new technologies among other factors have boosted the miningenergy sector and with it development opportunities for colombia currently the sector generates more than  direct jobs and  million indirect jobs it represents  of the national gdp around   trillion which is equivalent to the countrys education budget per year and a half exports correspond to  of the national total and it is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment with a share that exceeds  in addition royalty contributions made by oil and mining companies have contributed  of the reduction of poverty in colombia according to the national planning department in the last six years alone  projects have been financed mainly oriented to education and transportation the  biennial budget includes resources for   billion the highest amount since the creation of the general system of royalties in  the regions will have a total of   billion if the   billion of previous validities that have not yet been executed the challenge is for these vast resources to be translated in a transparent and timely manner into tangible works and benefits for the regions the reactivation of the sector that moves colombia without miningenergy revenues colombia would probably be a lowermiddleincome country and would no longer be an uppermiddleincome country where it is currently located along with brazil mexico and costa rica among others according to data from the world bank in order to conserve this source of resources it is necessary to continue energizing and promoting a sector that has proven capable of overcoming technological economic political and social challenges in the area of hydrocarbons our main commitment is to boost the industry in order to maintain our energy selfsufficiency which today is threatened with oil and gas reserves of only  years and  years respectively projections show that if we do not find new sources in  we may need imported gas to meet the demand for domestic gas in some areas of the country in order to find new sources of reserves we are working on four fronts reactivating exploration activity in continental areas encouraging an increase in the recovery factor of existing fields promoting the contractual conditions to start the next phase of exploration in offshore projects and continue alternatives in unconventional reservoirs meanwhile in mining it is essential that the country take advantage of diversification opportunities in light of global trends colombia has a high concentration of coal production which for a long time was one of the energy sources par excellence new technologies and global warming are challenging that condition as part of these discussions the electrification of mobility and new sources of power generation will require important minerals such as copper nickel and lithium colombia has important resources in some of these minerals copper for example is the conductor of energy par excellence an installed  megawatt wind turbine requires approximately  tons of copper this is just a sample of the opportunities to develop responsible mining while diversifying our mining matrix to continue generating employment investment and income for colombia the world changes at such a speed that what has made us successful so far does not ensure that we will be successful in the future we must ensure an energy transition that takes into account the global landscape and the objective of maximizing our resources liquid fuels will continue to be necessary to meet the global mobility demand for a considerable time since electric vehicles still have efficiency challenges and significant technological advances are needed for aircraft to have substitute energy sources gas will be one of the fuels most important during this transition and diversification of mining will also be key simultaneously the energy market must prepare with new alternative sources and the digitization and innovation of the market therefore the vision of the national government is to prepare colombia for the transition in the fourth industrial revolution modernizing the electricity sector with cuttingedge technologies that contribute to energy efficiency and environmental protection tools such as blockchain big data and automation smart meters batteries active demand participation electric mobility among others will be essential in addition we will advance towards the universalization of coverage in the electric power service bringing energy to  families who still do not have access to this service in the current fouryear period we have the firm intention of diversifying complementing and promoting the competitiveness of our energy matrix currently about  of the energy produced in the country comes from water sources this makes our matrix considered the sixth cleanest in the world according to the world economic council however it also makes us one of the most vulnerable countries to climate variability in terms of generation our goal is to go from  megawatts of installed capacity to at least  megawatts in nonconventional sources of renewable energy which represents investments estimated at between us   and us   million and a reduction of approximately three million tons of  equivalent to the planting of  million trees we will promote the full potential of alternative renewable sources in the caribbean region we have a unique opportunity the wind speed in la guajira is twice the world average and we also have one of the highest luminosities the potential for wind and solar resources in this region of the country may be greater than the water potential at the national level to speak of the transformation that colombia has undergone in the last  years is to speak of the miningenergy sector and talking about the transformation that the country will have in the coming years is talking about the energy transition it is to ensure that we can have an efficient reliable and sustainable sector that will continue to provide development and opportunities for colombiaecopetrol reported a profit of   billion the highest in five years the state oil company ecopetrol yesterday presented its financial results for the  fiscal year where it reported a net profit of   billion thus exceeding its  earnings by   billion which were   billion the company also revealed that last year its production reached  barrels of oil equivalent per day pbed compared to the  barrels per day it extracted in  related article ecopetrol reached  million barrels in reserves by adding  million in  it was an outstanding year in operational and financial terms today we are a more efficient and disciplined company with better technical capacity which strives for the integrity and safety of the operation net profit for the year amounted to   trillion the highest in the last five years and almost double that registered in   stated felipe bayon president of ecopetrol who highlighted that the average life of total reserves amounted to  years within the financial results it was also known that total sales were located at   billion which represented a growth of  compared to  when sales of   billion were registered the company also highlighted that the refining segment had an outstanding operating performance reaching a stable load of  barrels per day for the two refineries alexandra cely equity analyst for stocks and securities highlighted that during the accumulated of the year colombias oil production increased in general and therefore also that of ecopetrol and oil prices in the accumulated of the year also increased  a situation that favored the oil company the contrasts carlos leal president of the board of directors of acipet crude prices showed a significant improvement compared to the behavior of the last years after the crisis that helped the box to be very positive felipe bayon president of ecopetrol we met the annual production goal by reaching  barrels of oil per day despite operational events and difficulties in the first quarter of the year in october of last year brent reached over us   a barrel a maximum price that did not touch the reference since october  this scenario allowed the oil companys ebitda to stand at   billion with a  ebitda margin the highest in history what ecopetrol shows as ebitda far exceeds what was done in the last four years added said carlos leal president of the board of directors of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet for leal the factors that most affected the  indicators not only have to do with crude prices which showed a fairly significant improvement compared to the behavior of the basket in recent years after the crisis but also with the optimization process that the company has advanced throughout the value chain and the increase in production rates a trend that has been reflected in the last year in a positive wayecopetrol disclosed the  dividend payment amount to its shareholders the oil firm disclosed through relevant information to the financial superintendence the amount of dividend payment to its shareholders for the fiscal year ended in  according to the companys statement it is proposed before the shareholders meeting to distribute   per share in line with  of the dividend policy and   per share corresponding to the extraordinary dividend and overcompliance in the companys financial performance which explained does not compromise the business plan from  to  announced on february    the dates on which the transaction will be effective are april  june  and september  of the current year on the first occasion  of the ordinary and extraordinary dividend   will be paid to minority investors and  of the ordinary dividend for majority shareholders   in june the other  of the ordinary dividend   will be paid to the majority shareholder while in september the transaction of  of the extraordinary dividend will be made to the majority shareholder  ecopetrols new stage generates optimism related article ecopetrol disclosed the  dividend payment amount to its shareholders at the end of  the world oil industry experienced one of the worst drops in oil prices the economic failure for countries such as colombia highly dependent on the variation of crude oil caused large investments to be postponed and the state coffers to be emptied the situation was dramatic going from prices of around us   to a barrel of less than us   that was very serious not only for the colombian state but for its largest company ecopetrol the situation was so adverse that the transfers of the mixed company became nil which put in check the development programs promised by the then government of juan manuel santos with good judgment the national administration ecopetrols board of directors and its senior management advised by boston consulting undertook an ambitious business reconversion plan they reduced expenses merged vice presidencies eliminated management reduced sumptuous expenses and brought investments to almost zero unprofitable all of this was done with the consent of the then government and the commitment of ecopetrol employees things have now changed and those adjustments that were applied in times of lean cows are beginning to bear important fruit and in less than five years not only oil prices recovered but also the product of the great cut and commitment of officials it is beginning to be noticed and therefore the national government begins to reap the fruits of some good adjustments in  the highest profit of the last five years was recorded reaching   billion and doubling the profit of  when it only reached   billion these results are reached in the midst of political discussions on the role of ecopetrol for the economy which is still inappropriate and lacking in depth since few companies have achieved an ebitda of   billion and a margin of  average oil production last year was  barrels a day even reaching peaks close to  these production figures have allowed the joint venture to make investments of us   million  more than last year but the most eloquent data is that  additional wells were drilled a number that exceeded the dozen that had been planned for the previous year that means a geological success of  which few oil countries achieve the news that yesterday impacted the world of investors has to do with the announcement of a dividend an ordinary one for   and an additional one for   in total the oil company proposes to pay   for each share what should be celebrated the most from the point of view of the central state is that the government will receive   billion while minority partners are going to distribute just over   billion while its peers such as pdvsa and pemex have not yet come out of the lean cows our ecopetrol is making steady progress towards the true reconversion not only from the point of view of new resources but has also lightened its luggage to face the challenges of the future that they are intended for small flexible and competitive companies now it only remains to walk firmly that fracking has a free hand with the responsibility of sustainability with which a world like today requiresecopetrol has given the nation   billion in the last  years felipe bayon in lrs protagonistas en  forum the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon highlighted the growth of the company its commitment to the future and the importance of the state company for the country so much so

ecopetrol is working on three focuses growth of reserves and production structure of capital discipline and protection of cash and efficiency regarding reserves and production bayon assured that they are working to make this item grow we want to believe the reserves and production more exploratory wells and more crude and there is an important issue and it is the nonconventional reservoirs ync he said and he added today the country has close to  million barrels in reserves we believe that in the magdalena medio area we can be talking between  and  billion barrels of hydrocarbons that means we would have many more years of reserves the manager explained that they are convinced that it can be done well as they have proposed that they become pilots he clarified that for now the report of the committee of experts has come out and three things were requested dialogue with the communities regulation and sustainability when analyzing other issues the executive also spoke about the new refinery in cartagena reficar which today is one of the refineries that is the pride of the country of the region not only because of the impact it has on the economy  but because we are delivering the highest quality fuels to the country  to get to all these reflections the executive explained that ecopetrol is a company facing a very important crisis we had to hit the brakes and tighten our belts he said what are we doing promote this phantom of shortages we are working on expanding oil reserves and that is why we have worked on more exploratory wells he said from the exploration point of view the manager clarified that  wells were reached in  in the last quarter  exploratory wells one issue we are very proud of is that we are in mexico and brazil we have excellent partners in the

ecopetrol among the leading companies in innovation centers there is something that products such as nequi green gasoline the cement that the country exports and the platform for which they approve a loan in six minutes have in common all are developments generated from the innovation centers of each of the companies that baptize them and it is that although it seems logical not all companies are those that develop all of their innovative products however the establishment of these centers has helped the development of great ideas and products that today are success stories among the companies that have led this revolution in technology and entrepreneurship argos ecopetrol bancolombia banco popular claro accenture sap and merck stand out but companies are not the only ones that have taken

out that credilab has been in operation since the second half of ecopetrol and grupo argos are the ones that registered the most increases in profits during the past year related article ecopetrol reported a profit of   billion the highest in five years the improvement in several economic data after the presidential elections took place served to leverage the profits of the most important companies in the country in addition the recovery in the price of the reference barrel brent which was above us   after four years below us   and notable results in the cement energy and concessions businesses were some of the factors that helped companies such as cemargos ecopetrol and grupo argos to have the most outstanding growth in earnings reported in  by the final amount of the companies that have reported their consolidated financial statements to date ecopetrol also stands out for reaching the figure highest in profits with   billion and in revenues surpassing grupo exito which for several years remained with that first place in sales the boost from the oil company was due to the increase in the price of a barrel according to ecopetrol estimates which contributed   billion the lower purchase of imported crude oil    million thanks to the improvement in production of reficar and a higher rate of change which would have contributed an additional   million to the operation this generated revenues of   billion with an increase of  and profits of   billion the highest in the last five years for the president of the company felipe bayon one of the highlights regarding earnings is precisely the capital discipline and the efficiency plan fundamental pillars of our strategy and anchored in our business culture that are generating new and solid dynamics in all processes  as for grupo argos the main focus was on profitable growth which allowed it to achieve an ebitda of   billion the highest in the history of the business group and an ebitda margin of  according to its president jorge mario velasquez these results place us in a privileged position and with the optimism to continue promoting the development of infrastructure in our country the most notable growth in earnings was precisely from one of the groups subsidiaries cementos argos profit increased significantly exceeding   million with an increase of  this result is supported by geographic diversification increased financial flexibility and efforts to advance in efficiency and competitiveness among which the  drop in administration and sales expenses stands out these points were those that helped deliver benefits to its shareholders despite the  drop in sales due to an environment that they considered challenging due to excessive rainfall and drops in the housing sector on the revenue side grupo exito and grupo sura also obtained remarkable results reaching   billion and   billion respectively now in exito the experts pointed out the importance of the strategy of operational and financial efficiencies which achieved that despite a slight decrease of  in income an improvement of  in profits was obtained  in the group they also highlight that  will be a much better year since in  they had to handle a challenging macroeconomic context which decreased consumption in several countries the contrasts lucio rubio ceo of enel in colombia we obtained excellent results thanks to the good operating performance of our generation park and a dynamic commercial strategy felipe bayon president of ecopetrol these results were achieved among other things by the substitution of imported crude for local ones in the refineries and the lower importation of products the company that registered the highest growth in revenue to date was el condor which saw a  increase compared to  at the close of the year with a total of   million the highest billing levels in its history as reported by the company this significant improvement was due to compliance with investment programs along with construcciones el condor the five companies that grew the most in revenue last year were ecopetrol with  enelcodensa with  celsia with  and enelemgesa with  for energy companies the rise in demand especially in the nonregulated market as well as higher energy prices as a result of an optimal commercial sales strategy through longterm contracts enel explained despite the fact that the majority of companies showed a positive profit margin there were four companies that failed to improve compared to  and where despite obtaining revenues of about   billion as in the case of avianca there was a fall of   in profits whats next for local companies this year within the business plans for  bayon highlighted that ecopetrol expects to reach production levels between  and  barrels of oil per day between  and  as well as to grow the total reserves of the ecopetrol group  keeping the organic reserve replacement index above  without taking into account the price

important meetings at the end of the month this is ecopetrols shareholders meeting that will be held next friday march  at  am at the international business and exhibition center corferias in bogota the event is not important only because of the reputation of the state majority company but also because of the number of natural persons who are minority shareholders in the oil company related article find out what are the fees charged by brokerage firms in the country it is estimated that of about  holders of the species  have less than  uvrs in their portfolio a category for which the financial superintendency has launched special regulations with the in order to favor the income that remains from profit with the payment of dividends precisely the amount proposed by the firm to shareholders to be approved at the meeting is the highest since  this results from an ordinary dividend of   and an extraordinary dividend of   for a total of   per share the current proposal represents an increase of  compared to the one delivered for the period ended in  in addition it has a yield relation between the dividend prices per share distributed and the price of the security of  the second highest in the market below mineros and the first among the shares that belong to colcap in the past ecopetrol has dealt with this issue of extraordinary dividends so it is within the companys actions said camilo thomas equity analyst at alianza valores who highlighted that the possibility of delivering a higher dividend is it occurs for two main reasons the first the rise in oil and the dollar the second an increase in the firms production of  the expert stressed that despite the fact that the figure sounds low it is not so easy to achieve that increase in production in a year as it is a process that takes time and resources to achieve thus shareholders are going to receive   billion in dividends of which more than  is delivered to the nation so if the assembly approves ecopetrols proposal the country will receive   billion and minority shareholders   billion omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa highlighted that the benefits received by the firm in the year are good news for its shareholders and for the country as they are a consequence not only of high oil but of greater efficiencies of the company the numbers support these opinions since the average life of ecopetrols total reserves reached  years while when looking at only crude reserves this statistic was established in the range of between  and  years in addition the net profit reached was   billion in  the highest in the last five years on the other hand the company registered its highest ebitda in history which was established at   billion while the ebitda margin was  in  these figures had been   trillion and  respectively to this is added that the stock has seen a gain of   in its value so far this year a value equivalent to a rise of  the recovery of the oil company was such that this time it will distribute  of its profits just as it had been doing before  the equity analyst for equities and securities alexandra cely commented that with these results it was to be expected that ecopetrol would be the one that would deliver the best dividends to the nation the contrasts camilo thomas equity analyst alianza valores ecopetrol can deliver high dividends due to a mix of factors where the main one is the price of oil while the dollar remained on the rise alexandra cely equities and securities equity analyst it was to be expected that ecopetrol would be the one that would deliver the best dividends since the nation is the holder of the majority of the companys shares now the distribution of the dividend is not the only crucial issue to be decided at

pilots the most important thing is that we do not want to do them quickly we want to do them well we are going to take the necessary time currently the country has  billion barrels in reserves the unconventionals according to bayon would allow the reserves to increase by four or seven billion barrels instead of talking about having six years of oil we could talk about  or  years exactly the same thing happens in gas a napkin bill as i say if we had to import the  barrels that we refine every day for a year the country would need between us    us   million to import oil for refining said

operating performance of the portfolio companies  although terpel had one of the highest amounts in terms of income and a growth of  in this category its profits fell  being one of the most pronounced of the year in the top  as detailed the company in its earnings report this anomaly could arise from the acquisition of exxonmobils businesses in colombia peru and ecuador in midmarch now the president of the company sylvia escovar stressed that having achieved this operation will allow to bring the mobil brand to the regions with terpel coverage and to increase participation by bringing it closer to that of fuels in the country this implies doubling the participation that the terpel lubricants brand had  on the other hand one of the most prominent cases in terms of profits was that of empresas publicas de medellin epm which closed  with   trillion in this area a figure that registered a growth of  and according to records analyzed at the close of this edition it is the second highest amount after ecopetrol which reached a net profit of   billion faced with this issue the general manager of epm jorge londono de la cuesta said that the gas water transmission and distribution businesses performed better than in  in turn he stressed that they applied an austerity plan that allowed them to save a little more than   million a figure that helped us to support the higher expenses generated by the hidroituango contingency  what these results demonstrate is the solidity of the company that despite a crisis of great magnitude  the company can bear  londono also highlighted that ituangos solution is mediumterm and stressed that we hope to recover the project by  on the other hand the greatest growth in the profits of a company occurred in the case of cementos argos one of the subsidiaries of grupo argos after registering   million in net profit the company reflected a growth of  the contrasts sylvia escovar president of terpel having integrated exxon mobils lubricants operation into our company we expect growth and greater customer loyalty jorge londono de la cuesta general manager of epm hidroituango is a project in the development phase we were affected by a liquidity problem but not an operational or profitability issue for the company  this result is supported by geographic diversification increased financial flexibility and efforts to

sands which was verified by initial tests that show productions of between  and  million cubic feet per day this discovery leverages the exploration strategy of hocol and the ecopetrol group which continues to strengthen its position as a gas producer in northern colombia said rafael guzman president of hocolthe anh awarded blocks for fracking without an environmental framework says the comptrollers office not all the appropriate conditions are in place to meet the technical and environmental requirements needed to carry out fracking in the country that was one of the conclusions of a study by the office of the comptroller general of the republic cgr in which it was found that in addition to the deficiencies in environmental and water regulations to start the exploitation of nonconventional reservoirs ync they were awarded blocks in  without having a clear regulatory framework the  study gathered a series of conclusions similar to those delivered in february by the committee of experts a group of  specialists who at the time recommended to the national government to start with the implementation of this technique but under certain social conditions environmental and fiscal this report reveals rigorous technical work and ratifies the solid and coherent position of the comptrollers office which since  has been evidencing the risks and impacts of fracking for the communities and the country and requesting the application of the precautionary principle said carlos andres santiago coordinator of the alianza colombia libre de fracking although the possible risks and environmental impacts are addressed when using fracking one of the points that the comptrollers office highlighted the most was the regulatory standards and the limited institutional capacity which is reflected according to them in the award of blocks that were given in the  round which was done without an environmental regulatory framework the anh national hydrocarbons agency awarded blocks for the exploration and production of ync in the  round without having an environmental regulatory framework or the basic knowledge that would allow defining environmental restrictions on the implementation of fracking leading to environmental risks or to the establishment of future claim scenarios  explained the control body to which it warned the foregoing shows the lack of coordination between institutions related to the implementation of public policies like this fracking the contracts referred to in the comptrollers report have to do with the assignment of obligations that were given to parex resources colombia in that year however before and after this award more contracts were delivered that are still on the waiting list one to ecopetrol in  five to drummond in  and  and two to conocophillips in  and  to the anh all these projects are silent until the council of state and the national government give them a free hand at the beginning of the first fracking pilots given these findings the control body assured that the anh the ministry of mines and energy the ministry of environment and sustainable development and anla should strive for their articulation and strengthening in order to build an appropriate regulatory framework for the country  which allows you to monitor this technique and proper control another of the conclusions that the comptrollers office delivered was that the country still has to establish the appropriate conditions to meet the technical environmental and water requirements in fact he highlighted that since fracking is a technique that requires the consumption of considerable volumes of water on average   per well eventual conflicts over the use of water should be analyzed from a localregional perspective to this is added that the spatial distribution of aquifers paramos national natural parks and regional national parks compared to the delimitation of the ync blocks do not present intersections on their surfaces however according to the watchdog there are proximity in the wells that could affect these water sources what the government says the debate on fracking has voices for and against however the national government has said that starting the exploration of unconventional reservoirs would bring great benefits to the country as it would give it greater energy selfsufficiency increasing the recovery factor the possibilities of offshore exploration off shore and the ync will determine the oil selfsufficiency of colombia said maria fernanda suarez minister of mines and energy the tax benefits that implementing this technology would bring to the country trade unions companies and even the government have indicated that the implementation of fracking in the country would bring economic benefits according to the acp yncs pilot projects would contribute   billion to colombia in its development stage over the next  years developing unconventional deposits through fracking would allow colombia to guarantee its energy selfsufficiency that is that we produce what we consume for example gas said francisco lloreda president of the unionafter the mission more public assets could reach the capital market for almost a month the national government at the head of the ministry of finance appointed the members that would be part of the capital market experts commission who among other things have the task of looking for alternatives to boost the current stock market and deliver recommendations that improve the system with more investors and listed companies although the wise men are making a diagnosis of the current market and the totality of their proposals are not yet known the possibility is being considered that more assets of the state will reach the local stock market at the xii asofondos congress julio torres one of the missions commissioners assured that at this moment the work is being carried out in a first stage in which the vision and interpretation of the participants of this segment is being collected torres recalled that the commission is independent and pointed out that it is not being limited by implementation considerations or political aspects but that the idea is that from the diagnosis that is made and the presentation of the problems a solution is delivered a roadmap to achieve an architecture that is optimal and has a high probability that it will be implemented among the analyzes that have been carried out is that of feeding the supply and demand side of public assets so that they flow to the capital market and achieve a substantial push in supply similar to what happened at the time with ecopetrol how to encourage schemes for small businesses has also been discussed we are focusing on the entire financing cycle not only on public markets but also financing for entrepreneurship torres explained the intention of this capital injection mechanism for businesses would be structured to be done at the early stage said the expert who recalled that the document would be ready in the third quarter of the yearthe trouble to find the minority shareholders of ecopetrol related article dividends from ecopetrol to minority shareholders will be delivered on april  one of the key moments that was presented during the ecopetrol shareholders meeting held on march  was in the call of some minorities to the commission agents that manage their securities claiming for the high commission costs and the difficulty of communication between both parties as some investors are still not clear who is the current administrator of their securities directors and representatives of management firms such as global securities and davivienda corredores were present at the meeting which account for  of the shareholders of the oil company one of the factors to understand the problem is that since ecopetrols first issuance in  when the company was democratized for  investors market conditions have changed as have the firms that manage the portfolios for that first issue about  commission agents participated while today the market has only  of these thus the majority of the oil companys investors have been transferred to valores bancolombia  global securities  and davivienda corredores  while the remaining  is distributed in different firms according to the data from ecopetrols investor relations office these changes have been generated because some commission agents cease to exist and their managed assets are bought or assigned to another company but the plot has more to tell because it must be borne in mind that colombians interested in investing could also do so through a dozen banks and some businesses such as cafam exito and carulla in addition the shareholders in the firm have been reduced to  at the end of  which has hindered their access and even the payment of dividends the intention of democratization had been to make colombians participate in the flagship company said andre schober president of global securities who explained that as a result there are some investors who are in a risky profile invested in a single species in variable income when that is not its profile  but the risk of exposure of the investments of these people is not the main focus the difficulty in finding those who have lost track is being one of the biggest challenges for the firms according to a modeling of the ecopetrol investor carried out by global  of them are over  years old and  are in rural areas factors that pose a greater obstacle to finding them since access is difficult in the population with these characteristics technological in addition this profile is due to the fact that the purchase of shares spread throughout the country and by most social classes the drama to find them is such that only this commission agent still has  investors that it has not been able to contact although it has even searched for them on facebook we have used links to the social network to be closer to people with the rise of digital life and making use of registered emails we seek that advertising information can reach you as a way to fish and attract attention so that ecopetrol shareholders can click  explained schober davivienda corredores resource manager for  ecopetrol shareholders has also undertaken the search over the years with which according to its president maria teresa uribe it has been found that  of the owners of these shares have died we have searched these investors with the databases of brokers in the event that they do not match or are not their current data we look for them in public databases commented the directive who highlighted that in the assembly they directly interviewed about  clients and gave information to another  thus there are   of the total of ecopetrol investors who are classified as natural persons whose shares are traded in low amounts that is those with an investment of less than  uvr   million or its similar of  shares    millions this is a type of investor that according to the stock market analyst andres moreno has been leaving its shares due in part to the administration costs and the neglect they have received after democratization andres felipe sanchez head of investor relations at ecopetrol highlighted that in response to the shareholders claim the firm created the corporate strategy for minority shareholders an open membership agreement that has been in operation for less than a month and to which they have already signed global and davivienda the contrasts andre kurt schober president of global securities we are working with financial education we have found clients who have doubts about whether it is a cdt and we guide them with our team  maria teresa uribe president davivienda corredores for us it is very important to serve ecopetrol investors regardless of their amount in the assembly we interviewed  and informed  clients  with this in exchange for a reduction in rates to this population in particular the commission agents are offered participation in the assembly presence in their facilities and advertising this strategy is focused on the shareholders of low amounts and the objective is to get closer to the commission agents said sanchez who commented that although it was signed only by global and davivienda corredores there were also approaches with bancolombia but the company did not signed since it has special mechanisms for ecopetrol minorities with which many are exempt from commission payments and most have discounts as a result of this global initiative the collection of retailers decreased by  those with less than   million invested will pay   annually instead of   and so on with the other amounts brokers denied that it has already chosen whether the discount will be made on the dividend or on commissions uribe explained that they have kept rates low because last year clients of less than   million were charged   for annual administration and the average for all was   where could your actions be the experts in the sector pointed out that when in doubt it is better to approach the centralized securities depository of colombia deceval a stock exchange company where with your id they can tell you if you are a shareholder of ecopetrol how many shares you have and which commissioner manages them among the main firms it must be borne in mind that if their titles were with bbva valores proyectar valores colombian shares professionals of the stock exchange or itau among others it is most likely that global securities will manage them while the shareholders from interbolsa are divided into several firms see graphthis is the vision that ecopetrol has to boost its gas business in the country achieving close to   trillion in profits in  consolidating the highest ebitda in history and reaching a profitability with a price per barrel of us   are the reasons why ecopetrol already adjusts its strategy in its different businesses no only in crude oil but in gas and energy this was confirmed by the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon who in the middle of the twentysecond naturgas congress  in cartagena explained that the signing of new contracts in the caribbean sea the intensification of onshore exploratory activities and the potential nonconventional reservoirs will be a key element in increasing the gas supply in the coming years bayon indicated that the high exploration and gas development potential in the llanero foothills would contribute between  and  tcf cubic terapie while offshore activity in the colombian caribbean which has been boosted with the signing of new exploration contracts  represents a potential between  and  tcf the president of ecopetrol estimated that the  well located in the tayrona block could enter production in  while gas from the new gasproducing province of the southern caribbean where the kronos purple angel and gorgon it would be estimated for approximately  the potential of the nonconventional reservoirs ync in the basins of the middle magdalena valley cesarrancheria and catatumbo has been estimated between  and  tcf the challenge we have as an industry is to successfully carry out the comprehensive research pilots of ync taking into account the recommendations of the commission of experts and those of the comptroller general of the republic said the manager at the same time bayon invited the sector to join forces to strengthen the mass consumption of natural gas a fuel that is used according to him by  million colombians another announcement he made was that the ecopetrol group has an energy transition process underway that contemplates expanding the portfolio of renewable energies solar biomass hydro from  megawatts to  megawatts in the coming years although he assured that between  and  a total of  colombians have benefited from  agreements signed by ecopetrol to stimulate the use of natural gas he maintained that in the next three years the company seeks to almost fivefold the number of beneficiaries to reach  additional userspresident of ecopetrol trusts in good future results but not in a boom yesterday an opec report generated a stir in oil production accounts globally but especially in south america as venezuelas pumping was close to  barrels per day while colombia is close to  the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon referred to the issue and pointed out to la fm that we have the potential for the industry in general not only ecopetrol to strengthen this is in the benefit of the country but i dont think it is a boom you have to be cautious  with the venezuelan figure the neighboring country moves away from its historical pumping maximums and now the largest producer in south america is surpassed by colombia taking into account that at the end of february latest report from the ministry of mines and energy  local production was  barrels  barrels more than venezuela at the time the minminas reported that this february figure showed an annual growth of  and  compared to january however the sector maintains that the march report would not be less than at least  barrels per day which would confirm a higher production than that of venezuela opec and other noncartel oil producers including russia agreed to cut production by  million bpd starting january  for six months its delegates are expected to meet june  to decide whether to extend the pact the iea said that voluntary limits on production under that agreement and the reduction in pumping from venezuela caused opec production to drop  bpd in march the agency also maintained its forecast for growth in global oil demand for  at  million barrels per day the tension in the oil market  is not just a supply issue in recent months the strength of demand has received less attention said the ieaexploration of the first offshore well will begin in may  luis miguel morelli on the second day of the twentysecond naturgas congress in cartagena the president of the national hydrocarbons agency luis miguel morelli explained that the award of the nine offshore contracts is expected this year which will boost exploration and production of oil and gas morelli stressed that if the schedules are met the exploration of the first well would begin between may and june of next year this is where we will have good potential to discover new reserves and expand the selfsufficiency of the country said the president of the anh assured that there are already five contracts signed and four more are missing if we manage to sign those  contracts it would be investments of more than us   million for everything he explained one of the points on which he emphasized the need to expand colombias reserves which today exceed  cubic therapies morelli stressed that while the colombian caribbean could become the new gas province it is expected to be able to bring new investors to the pacific coast we are definitely neither mexico nor brazil in this matter but colombia has a very important offshore power and is opening up to that new line he saidthese are the companies that increased dividends the most compared to last year this month shareholders of colombian companies began to see the returns on their investments from last year with the first installments of dividends which in general were quite favorable after the end of the ordinary assemblies of the issuing companies a good performance of the approved dividends can be highlighted because of the  companies analyzed by casa de bolsa in its special report dividends turn on the party in   approved the payment of an ordinary dividend  increased the total dividend to be paid to its partners and  had an increase in the profitability of its dividends the companies that increased the total dividend the most compared to that defined the previous year were ecopetrol with  and corficolombiana with  the variation of the oil company was marked by the approval of an ordinary dividend of   per share and an extraordinary dividend of   per share which are supported by a net profit of   billion  higher than that presented in  according to the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon the dividend of   per share is the fourth highest in the history of the company on april  the total payment of ordinary and extraordinary dividends will be made to minority shareholders while the nation will receive the payment in three installments  on that same date and the other two payments in july and september for its part the corficolombiana shareholders meeting approved to pay   per share on may  the financial entitys results are mainly explained by a business with promigas and by the start of construction of three of the four  highway concessions that were awarded to it the top five of the companies that increased their dividends the most are completed by promigas with a variation of  grupo exito with an increase of  and grupo aval which increased its delivery by  on the contrary avianca holdings and terpel decreased their dividends by  and  respectively compared to  while cemex latam holdings conconcreto and etb decided not to distribute dividends regarding the increase in dividend profitability the companies that stood out the most were mineros promigas and ecopetrol which had dividend yields of   and  respectively the contrasts omar suarez variable income manager at casa de bolsa the growth of the colombian economy in  was quite slow while in  there was a gradual recovery in growth and consumption raul moreno mercado equity analyst global securities colcap achieved the second highest dividend yield in the region which will increase investors appetite and interest in colombian stocks the companies with the lowest dividend yield were grupo sura  grupo argos  and grupo exito  when reviewing the companies analyzed according to the proportion of payment  of these increased it the firms that had the highest percentage of profit distribution were cementos argos  promigas  and the colombian stock exchange  in the case of the cement company its profit was   million and it was approved to distribute   million in addition it was decided to use the profits of  and previous years for   million also for the distribution of profits which explains the payout greater than  when reviewing avianca holdings payout ratio it was  however omar suarez casa de bolsas equity manager explained that this was not taken into account in the comparison because the companys profit was very low in  the company had very small profits considering its size so even though they reduced the dividend any payment to shareholders is oversized he said the companies with the lowest payouts were el condor  corficolombiana  and davivienda  the median of the payment proportion of the colcap companies that will pay dividends for this year is  suarez pointed out that these good results are the product of several factors including higher economic growth in  an increase in consumption and a decrease in inflation growth and higher consumption helps sales while the fall in inflation reduces the debts of companies since many of these are tied to the cpi uvr and dtf this translates into lower financial expenses and has a positive effect on profits he said the analyst also mentioned that the tax reform of the government of juan manuel santos influenced the results as the gradual decrease in taxes improved profits it is worth mentioning that the best balance of results was observed in the fourth quarter of  and was a turning point compared to the deterioration recorded in the previous quarters if colcaps dividend yield is measured with those of other comparable indices in the region the colombian is the second with  surpassed only by the brazilian index which achieved  in third place is mexico which obtained  in fourth place chile with  in fifth place peru which reached  and in sixth place argentina with  the performance of the current colcap index is among the highest in the last  years and is well above its average historical level since  which is  ricardo moreno equity analyst at global securities highlighted that with this result colcap is higher than fixed income thus generating greater appetite and interest for investors these returns will motivate greater participation of investors which could generate upward pressure on the price of the shares said the expert analysts expectations point to the economic recovery being maintained and reflected in positive balances for companies a boost that is already being seen so far this year the amount delivered by colcap beats fixed income in profitability the spread between fixed income at one year and the yield of colcap dividend is inclined in favor of shares casa de bolsa analysts point out that for investors whose investment objective is oriented towards cash flow at this time the dividend paid by the shares looks attractive compared to the profitability of shortterm fixed income securities it should be noted that historically the dividend yield has always been lower than the fixed income yieldthe exdividend period for ecopetrol shareholders begins today today begins the exdividend period of ecopetrol so those people who register as owners of shares of the firm on tuesday april   will have the right to receive the payment of the dividend this means that the people who buy their shares in the signature from today will not be able to receive the payment of the dividend approved in the general assembly likewise if you are the owner and sold shares yesterday or before you will no longer have the right to receive the dividend on those titles and it will be received by the person who bought them before holy tuesday because it is who appears

stock market analyst warns that normally the share price sees a correction when it enters the exdividend period so investors should not be scared the analyst explained that the people who wake up today with the dividend will be able to claim the   per share but we must remember on this day the action normally corrects   or   between  and  of the dividend paid from the following days the shares can be sold without any problem  in the last week of april when the dividend payment for common shares is made investors will be able to approach their stock brokers and claim their earnings and it

oil pipeline in colombia after the attacks that took place in the cano limoncovenas pipeline in recent days ecopetrol had more than  workers to carry out the cleaning work of the pozo azul cano cinco and the rivers tibucito and tibu which were contaminated by the oil spills resulting from the incident to attend to emergencies six alternative control points have been assigned that are distributed in cano cinco and the tibucito and tibu rivers with  lines of barriers that seek to contain the hydrocarbon stain one of the points that has received special attention is pozo azul whose waters turned black despite being the main attraction of this place which is characterized by being a tourist emblem of catatumbo according to the information faced with the events that occurred in the area president ivan duque spoke through his twitter account and stressed that crimes against biodiversity must be severely punished by attacking the nations resources we condemn ecocide perpetrated by eln in pozo azul norte de santander crimes against biodiversity threaten strategic resources of the nation which must be severely punished terrorism sacrifices the environment again we advance in cleaning tasks  ivan duque ivanduque april   in turn ecopetrol reinstalled the alternative control points tibucito and samanes with a total of  barriers after tuesdays rains destroyed the containment elements the containment work was attended by the vice minister of the environment roberto esmeral as well as the general director of the regional autonomous corporation of the northeast border corponor gregorio angarita lamk both officials were accompanied by the national army during the evaluation of the environmental impact in the area affected by the oil spills these terrorist actions which left around  inhabitants deprived of access to drinking water are attributed by the government to the guerrillas of the army of national liberation eln for its part ecopetrol called for the end of these violent acts that threaten the integrity of people and seriously damage the natural resources of the region the attacks occurred during the unilateral ceasefire by this group which it would have been proposed on the occasion of holy weekbrent rise supposes an additional   billion in revenue for the national government opecs scheduled cuts shortages in venezuelan exports and geopolitical tensions between the united states and iran are the perfect breeding ground for the price of oil to skyrocket rapidly yesterday with the announcement of donald trump to prohibit a group of countries from importing iranian crude a new record was registered taking brent to us   an increase of us   or   the highest level since november  and an increase of  in its value so far this year related article brent hits annual highs with data from china and a decrease in production in the us for colombia this increase in the price of crude oil translates into good news because the government of ivan duque according to its mediumterm fiscal framework made accounts with a brent at us   a barrel if the current figure of us   per barrel is maintained there would be a difference in favor of us   which means additional income to the national coffers according to the ministry of finance and unions such as acipet each dollar that oil rises represents for the country between   million and   million if the difference between what was stipulated and what is currently happening is us   it would be between an additional   billion and   billion a figure that the government had not contemplated the royalties that the government will obtain will be much higher thanks to the increase in prices these rates are very likely to be sustained taking into account trumps latest decision to extend the trade blockade against iran said pablo medina an analyst at welligence energy despite the results the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon indicated that although prices are favorable caution must be maintained regarding revenues currently the state company generates profits on a barrel in a range of us   to us   different from  when the base of its profitability was over us   we must not claim victory with the price increase in the international market in recent days it is necessary to maintain discipline efficiency and the savings achieved in recent years said felipe bayon president of ecopetrol the increase in annual revenues for every dollar that brent rises is   million for ecopetrol if the same base that the government stipulated us   is taken into account it can be indicated that the company will have additional revenues of   billion in  with the current brent rate the opec cuts and geopolitical tensions have provided support so that crude prices can be encouraged generating the current rates that the market has said carlos alberto leal nino president of acipet the united states dictates the price the us government is the main player in the rise in oil prices although president donald trump has openly criticized opec for its intention to bring prices to us   before the end of the year he has also reduced the supply of heavy crude with his sanctions against iran and venezuela two of the main heavy fuel suppliers in the case of tehran the trump administration wanted to reduce its exports to zero by denying the extension of the permission granted to other countries to continue negotiating with the iranians according to the white house the government chaired by hasan rohani failed to comply with the nuclear pact to which it was committed in the era of barack obama and imposed penalties on all countries that had any commercial relationship with their oil companies and refineries china was the main buyer of iranian crude in march with the acquisition of  barrels per day followed by south korea with  barrels and india with  barrels in total the country sold  million barrels during that period with the decision announced by the white house as of next may  rohani would not have any port to embark its oil which caused an increase in general prices of more than  to avoid the effects on its allies the united states secured commitments from producers such as saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to compensate for the loss of fuel other nations such as india and china indicated that they incorporated new contracts with kuwait abu dhabi and mexico to sustain their consumption venezuela is another of the main victims of the washington sanctions despite the fact that its production struggles to reach one million barrels its importance is capital in the heavy crude market taking into account that it is one of the few extractors that exist alongside the countries of the middle east venezuelan production has been in free fall for a long time however few nations have the capacity to substitute their fuel and those that exist also have conflicts with the united states medina said in addition to the difficulties to produce there are already several companies that do not want to have a relationship with pdvsa and have openly refused to receive payment of the debt that the state company has with barrels of oil opec pounding trump the opec alliance which controls  of global crude production has indicated that its intention is to bring the price of a barrel to us   before the end of  despite the warnings that trump has made to release his reserves to counterbalance the price increase the alliance has indicated that they do not intend to reduce the cuts but rather extend them until july opec members can adjust to the cuts and have the support of other massive extractors like russia it is expected that the reductions will be maintained taking into account that the april meeting to reaffirm the agreement has been canceled in order to give it a longer term added medina until february the members met  their objective which aims to reduce  million barrels per day this placed the production of all members and russia at  million barrels while the united states remained at an average of  million barrelsthis is what the state ecopetrol earns with a brent oil at us   the symptoms of the dutch disease that colombia experienced in recent years due to the fall in oil prices forced the government to find a way to diversify its productive apparatus however in times like these when the brent benchmark recovers to above us   the price of crude oil again becomes an opportunity to cover the gap in the public coffers through the additional contributions that ecopetrol would transfer between dividends royalties and taxes in addition to this the state company also wins with an exchange rate rising by   related article ecopetrols profits reached   billion in  and according to corficolombiana projections with a stable oil at us   and a dollar at   ecopetrols net profit could rise to   for next year trillion which would represent an increase of  compared to the figure registered in  it should be remembered that it is estimated that each additional dollar in the price of oil represents about   million in profits for the company precisely for the profits of   billion last year the oil company announced a dividend distribution of   billion where each shareholder would keep   per share   for ordinary dividend and   for extraordinary the contrasts carlos leal president of acipet the increase in the price of the brent reference will mean income from royalties and oil sales higher than what the national budget had budgeted for with the current variables and  payout it is estimated that the value of the dividends would be   billion this year it was  but with a  extraordinary dividend i assume that they are not going to resort to that again  explained andres duarte perez director of equities at corficolombiana in addition if the oil continues to be stable at us   it is estimated that the total revenue of the state company would reach   billion which would imply an increase of  compared to the sales of   billion registered last year  specifically the analyst projected that exploration and production revenues would be located at   billion the difference in prices between what is projected and what is current will generate a significant increase in income for the nation hopefully these additional resources will be well invested in the matter of royalties said carlos leal president of the board of directors of acipet also the ebitda that in  achieved its best figure in history by reaching   billion would get another record figure for the oil company by reaching   billion that is it would rise another  if we simply take into account this price of oil these better prospects could also help drive your stock price higher although yesterday the paper was quoted at about   it is projected that this value could reach   that is it would grow  despite the strength of the oil price the dollar remains strong this reflects the relative strength of the economies in the world  indicated omar suarez manager of variable income at casa de bolsa to this it is also added that an expensive dollar benefits exporters in this sense ecopetrol also receives good news as it exports  barrels per day of oilthe good news of expensive oil and high dollar the traditional relationship between oil prices and the dollar is due to a kind of scissors graph which is nothing more than always behaving in reverse that is when the barrel of crude rises the dollar opposes and falls  it is precisely this trend that is breaking in the last hours when the wti benchmark rises  and brent  reaching us   per barrel and us   per barrel respectively and the dollar achieves an increase of   compared to the representative market rate which stood at   yesterday the market situation is the best for the exporting companies headed by ecopetrol which is the one that is doing the best in this situation of expensive dollar scarce product the same does not happen with other traditional export products that have a different international market reality such as coffee which incidentally is finishing its first harvest of the year but in a situation of purchase prices well below the traditional ones in short while oil is doing very well for the revalued dollar plus the price of the product on the rise coffee experiences only one side of that good news the good exchange rate that will be added to the good subsidies given by the government the good outlook for oil prices has to do with opecs planned cuts declining venezuelan crude exports and geopolitical tensions held by the united states and iran which have been deepened by the us governments decision to ban venezuela a group of countries importing iranian crude this has led to international prices reaching the highest level since november  and an increase of more than  in their value so far this year colombia is a great beneficiary since according to its medium term fiscal framework it made accounts with a brent at us   a barrel if the current figure of us   per barrel is maintained there would be a difference in favor of us   which means additional income to the national coffers for every dollar that oil rises in international markets the country represents an additional   million to   million which becomes good news if you consider that this translates into royalties the oil market indicates these days that the country would receive   billion and an additional   billion it should be noted that the situation must be managed well and that it is not a new bonanza like those that have occurred in the past and that have not been used in colombia ecopetrol must act as the faithful of the balance since it is necessary to maintain savings efficiency and maximize the level of administration achieved in recent years the increase in annual revenues for every dollar that brent rises is   million for ecopetrol if the same base that the government stipulated us   is taken into account it can be indicated that the company will have additional revenues of   billion in  with the current brent rate the ideal clearly would be that these additional income be saved in a fund to avoid new tax reforms if these new revenues go to spending it would be one of the worst executive decisions and as always the good news for oil companies would go into oblivion without being felt by the economic countrytoday is

the various goals that the oil company already sets is to reach a level of organic production between  to  barrels of oil per day in addition to this it is also betting on a growth in reserves with a replacement rate greater than  and maintaining a robust cash position that helps it leverage the investment grade it projects to achieve these objectives ecopetrol assured that it will invest between us   and us   million in the midst of this frame of reference and the volatility of crude oil prices the company also announced that it will work in the nonconventional fields which according to the projections of the oil company have a potential of between  and  million barrels crude oil reserves the oil companys bid to start fracking pilots in the country ecopetrol already has a clear roadmap to start the first exploration pilots of nonconventional reservoirs ync in the country a few weeks ago the oil company announced that around us   million will be invested for this plan with the aim of starting the development of fracking in magdalena medio although the government has not yet given the green light to implement this production method the company has already identified  wells which are ready for exploitation and productionwe contribute almost  of ecopetrols production maria victoria riano related article at equion energia we understood that great challenges make people happy equions president maria victoria riano commented that her companys contribution to the financial results of ecopetrol which has  of the firm and  of the association contract amounts to  of what they produce and the figures reported of the barrels that they produced which exceed  we contributed more or less  he said regarding equions financial results the company obtained revenues of us   million during  a figure that grew  compared to  in turn ebitda reached us   million with a margin greater than  the company operated around  barrels a day as of  of which  barrels a day are liquid and the rest corresponds to gas when the net is taken out which is equivalent to  of that total the figure of us   million is obtained which shows the net income compared to the first quarter of the year the company obtained net income of us   million in this regard riano commented that this figure in relation to barrels had a similar behavior compared to  when it is obtained at normalized prices for the first quarter companies should look at what they enter the market with and we did it with a very good production when those inputs remain that way and the declines in the fields are controlled the struggle is to keep production stimulated he said riano also spoke about the fluctuation of oil prices which a year ago reached us   a barrel of brent after several years the executive mentioned that it is a matter of cycles because we lasted a long time with those prices and when they fell in  we had to adjust to the conditions and that was the crisis today the lesson learned we have projections and projects that can be done with prices around us   or us    currently the company has its operation located in casanare a region that counts the foothills of the plains as a special area for the companys performance as a result of the development of technology each well that is made there may be costing us   million or us   million in addition to going down more or less to  feet which is equivalent to five kilometers each well can produce up to  barrels a day according to official figures today the company has  wells on said land according to riano while the companys operational results are promising so is its sustainability management as it has worked in favor of protection and value for life see box standing out both in performance and in csr a responsible company among the recognitions that equion has received are the sustainability seal of the esencia plus category which makes it the first hydrocarbon company to receive this certification and the first in colombia in that category in turn the increase in trust and credibility in its management is  according to invamer reputation studiesthe possible sale of isa would leave the government approximately   billion as the government of ivan duque has been stating since his inauguration during his tenure some disposals could take place that would allow the country to obtain the necessary resources to meet fiscal goals and in turn invest them for the benefit of the national economy one of those movements was announced last tuesday through a document from the ministry of finance where it is detailed that it is studying how much the government could earn from the sale of  it has in the service company interconectado electrica sa isa company that according to exercises carried out by investment banks in recent years has a valuation close to   trillion  of gdp equivalent to about us   million said an anif report that estimates that in this way the government could earn about   trillion this value would not take into account the sale that empresas publicas de medellin epm also reactivated yesterday of  of its stake in isa this document is known weeks after the government indicated that it could also activate the sale of the remaining  that it has authorized in the shares of the nation in ecopetrol a process that is slow but that would also be part of the plan with the that the duque administration would raise approximately   billion missing from the budget although there is still no official statement by the government regarding these possible movements sources close to the process indicated that at the moment only an evaluation of the portfolio of assets of the nation is being carried out so this does not mean that has approved a divestiture program as bloomberg said likewise he explained that the news is anticipating a scenario that for now is uncertain now experts also pointed out that it is possible that in the studies where it is expected that the government can raise almost   billion with the sale of certain assets according to anif calculations it is also included in the analysis of the valuation of certain regional electricity companies as well as zenith when it comes to hydrocarbons as can be seen the fiscal planb of the duque administration actually only has the option of privatization in substantive assets such as those of ecopetrol cenit and isa those most likely options could raise resources for around  of gdp if they are fully approved the anif report noted despite the noise generated by these operations analysts say that it could be a good source of investment if properly invested omar suarez highlighted that the sale of isa surely responds to an issue of a fiscal need to be able to meet in the short term those limits required by the  fiscal rule onwards the foregoing taking into account that it is a very striking company with profitability and cash flow margins that in recent years have been interesting  finally the government will also study whether it is more profitable to receive those   trillion direct or whether it is most appropriate for the countrys finances in the medium term to continue receiving close to   million in dividends per year from a longterm point of view it is not the best decision however it is possible that the company will be favored by the sale because it would allow it to seek direct partners added raul moreno an analyst at global securities sale of assets could be well seen if it is invested correctly the sale of various assets that could add up to close to   billion and would include isa part of ecopetrol cenit and local electricity companies by the government is increasingly gaining strength with which analysts are on the lookout and trust that the resources of these operations are well reused what has always been asked of the government is to invest in projects that generate a positive dividend for the countrys economy and not to cover fiscal gaps said juan david ballenecopetrol and cenit the ones that generated the most profits in  within the  largest today the superintendency of companies delivered the document which gathers the information of the  largest companies in the country of the group of  that ecopetrol leads with revenues of   billion and lg electronics closes with   billion those that stand out for having higher profits are again ecopetrol with   billion followed by its subsidiary cenit with   billion the top five are completed by gestora de adminegocios with   billion grupo aval with   billion and bavaria with   billion it is good to note that the superintendency is working on the full report that it will present on wednesday of the other week and for the moment the report presents the unconsolidated statements of the companies which is why for example reficar appears on the list third place above almacenes exito when the consolidated statements indicate that the latter would be the second with   billion in revenue it is important to show that this year in terms of the profits of the  largest grew significantly compared to   going from   billion to   billion this shows the recovery of various sectors such as energy which benefited from higher prices and a reactivation in consumption in at least   trillion must come in to be in the top  largest companies at the end of  lg entered more than   trillion a figure that meant it closed the top  of the largest companies in colombia according to the report presented this thursday by the superintendency of companies with the  most influential names in the national economy  the figure represents an increase of   billion if one takes into account that a year ago dinissan was ranked  on the list with revenues of approximately   billion the document also shows that to aspire to be the company with the highest income in the country at least   billion must be entered which would equal what was registered last year by ecopetrol number one in the ranking however according to the list published by supersociedades the possibility of this happening is remote taking into account what was entered by terpel second on the list and which reached   billionthe bestselling companies in colombia last year by region in the regions of the country bogotacundinamarca antioquia caribbean pacific coast eje cafetero and santander the leading companies within the  largest according to supersociedades were ecopetrol with   billion in operating income cartagena refinery with   billion exito stores with   billion coomeva with   billion audifarma with   billion and share with   billion respectively it is good to point out that the analysis was delivered with the individual results collected by the supersociedades from the other superintendencies so that by consolidating the income of the companies in the caribbean avianca leads with revenues of   billion and reficar moves to position seven of the  largest another of the companies that led in the top  in the bogotacundinamarca area was organizacion terpel sa with   billion comcel with   billion while in antioquia the one that followed exito was epm with   billion and eps sura the region with the most

grupo exito which had revenues of   billion while ecopetrol ranked second with   billion however for this year exito had a drop of  while ecopetrol had a rise of  regarding the performance of the company the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon mentioned that  was an outstanding year in operational and financial terms which made it grow above market expectations the capital discipline and the efficiency plan fundamental pillars of our strategy are generating new and solid dynamics in all the companys processes this is evidenced by the results of the operational and commercial strategies that we undertook throughout the year  he assured it is also important to mention that ecopetrol was the company with the highest profits in  closing the year with profits of   billion a figure that presented considerable growth registering   billion in  with respect to the top five of this year the companies that accompany ecopetrol and grupo exito are terpel with total revenues of   billion empresas publicas de medellin epm with   billion and avianca with   billion faced with the performance of terpel the company maintained the third place in which it was located in  although it registered a growth in sales of  in its final figure since at that time it closed with   billion the same did not happen with its profits which fell  being one of the steepest drops of the year in the top  terpels president sylvia escovar mentioned that many of our growth were leveraged by the results of the business derived from the acquisition of exxonmobils operations in colombia peru and ecuador  the purpose of this initiative as mentioned by the executive is to bring the mobil brand to the regions and to be able to increase our participation by bringing it closer to the one we have in fuels in the country this implies doubling the participation of the terpel lubricants brand  after obtaining control of exxonmobils operations these have generated terpel us   million of ebitda and  million gallons at the end of  according to the companys financial results in the case of epm the company headed by jorge londono de la cuesta closed  with   billion in revenue a figure that registered a  growth compared to  when it had a total of   billion at the same time it maintained the fourth position with which it closed in  the executive highlighted to lr that the gas water transmission and distribution businesses performed better than in  in turn he stressed that they applied a austerity that allowed them to save a little more than   million a figure that helped us to support the higher expenses generated by the ituango hydroelectric contingency last year  among the benefits of remaining leaders in income the executive highlighted that it is our objective since it is synonymous with greater social investment construction of infrastructure projects protection of the environment and generation of employment in short more opportunities for colombians which translates into a better quality of life he added regarding avianca the company closes the top five with sales of   billion a figure that grew  compared to  when it had   billion it should be noted that despite the fact that the company stands out in terms of revenue its profits went from   million to   million with a fall of  which is why the company has reinvented itself and among the

refineria de cartagena reficar with   billion grupo nutresa with   billion cementos argos with   billion and comcel sure with   billion the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol today we are a more efficient and disciplined company with better technical capacity which always strives for the integrity and safety of the operation sylvia escovar president of terpel it was a very good quarter for the company obtaining results that reflect the strategic discipline mainly focused on the client how are the profits in addition to ecopetrol which also leads in this area the  companies that recorded the most profits in  were cenit with   billion isa with   billion bavaria with   billion epm with   billion grupo energia bogota geb with   billion grupo argos with   billion grupo exito with   billion comcelclaro with   billion and carbones del cerrejon with   million how much does the  add up according to the supersociedades data the total revenues of the  companies together totaled   billion it should be noted that this sum is equivalent to about half of what the duque governments national development plan costs for the next four years for its part to be part of the list of the  largest companies it is necessary to have revenues greater than   trillion a figure that grew  compared to  when it was only necessary to have   trillion compared to the  largest companies in the country sales amounted to   billion and profits were   billion in the list of the  largest the service sector is the one with the most presence this sector has  companies of which  are within the first  of the list it is also seen that the most important is epm the second sector was commerce which has  companies and  of them are in the top  hydrocarbons and public services are the leading sectors in the top  the hydrocarbons and public services sectors were the sectors that led the  companies largest of  the first registered five companies ecopetrol terpel reficar cenit and primax while the second had four firms that were epm isa condensa and grupo energia bogota the other sectors were commerce with grupo exito olimpica and colombiana de comercio aviation with avianca industry with grupo argos food with grupo nutresa and finally construction with cementos argosin the first quarter top  companies continue to grow revenue in may the calendar for the delivery of financial results for the first quarter of the main companies in the country began and analysts projected at the time that those that would lead with the best numbers would be those of the oil and services sector according to the results the analysts were right ecopetrol and terpel are still in the top  with not only higher revenues in this period but also increasing sales compared to  this improvement is also compounded by exito which grew  compared to the same last years period ecopetrol took the lead in revenue the company reported that its sales during the first quarter were   billion an increase of  in the first quarter the groups production reached  barrels of oil a day close to the highest range established in the years goal in that sense julio cesar alonso director of the icesi center for research in economics and finance indicated that ecopetrols result can be explained by oil prices and the restructuring process to reduce costs in recent years meanwhile mario rodriguez finance professor at the politecnico grancolombiano said that the results of the companies are largely due to the good performance of the economy this quarter especially in sectors such as hydrocarbons and the rebound in retail trade  this last point boosted grupo exito second on the list which continues to consolidate good results in the first quarter of  the company achieved revenues of   billion a figure that represented a growth of  terpel competes with grupo sura in third place since the two showed revenues of   billion with growth of  and  respectively in addition it is noteworthy that grupo sura reported that in the first quarter that its net income grew    million due to a positive performance in all investments another of the companies that had good results and that is in line with the projections is bancolombia which reported that net interest income reached   billion as explained by the company this growth was evidenced by the annual rise in the loan portfolio on the other hand the income of argos a cement company of grupo argos grew  the company disclosed total revenue of   billion another company with increases was isa which increased its net profit  and operating income amounted to   trillion which represents an increase of  compared to  in this same sector which continues to have earnings this year grupo energia bogota stands out whose income went from   million to   billion with a growth of  entering the group of one billion now one of the companies that always ranks in the top  is avianca however this year it is having difficulties as it consolidates its restructuring although the airline achieved revenues of   billion these fell  finally it is worth highlighting tecnoglass which achieved record revenues of us   million by growing  in the first quarter of this year factors that influence the results according to mario rodriguez poligran expert in the case of the good results obtained by ecopetrol two things may benefit the increase in oil prices and the sanctions against pdvsa by the united states that has made this country a buyer of colombian oil  it should be noted that ecopetrol highlighted in its report that these results were achieved even with a lower price of brent which in the first quarter of  was at us   per barrel and at the end of the first quarter of the year it was at us    the business profits of the largest firms grew  during  last year was a challenging year for companies due to different situations such as the presidential elections the tax reform and other factors that impacted consumer confidence which remained in negative territory with a result of  at the end of the year according to fedesarrollo these events led us to think that  had been a complex year and that it was going to impact business results however according to the results of the superintendency of companies the companies that managed to enter the club of the  largest in the country obtained   billion in profits the contrasts carlos sepulveda dean of economics at u del rosario the fact that there are more service companies in this publication reflects the general dynamism of the economy and the sectors that are driving this growth jorge ivan gonzalez professor of economics at the national university in colombia the industry ended the country currently exports oil and increased imports of different products from the industrial sector  in the top  of the club of the most winners are ecopetrol with   billion in profits cenit with   billion gestora adminegocios with   billion grupo aval actions and securities with   billion and isa with    trillion related article the mining and hydrocarbons sector was the one that grew the most in income in  when stopping for a few seconds in this ranking it is obvious that the companies that are there are not the same ones that had the most operating income in  except ecopetrol in addition it is evident that the first two companies with the highest profits last year belong to the hydrocarbons and services sector which is mainly due to an increase in the price of oil said jorge ivan gonzalez an economist at the university nacional who also pointed out that it is noteworthy that the operation has been maintained completing the list of the  companies that earned the most within the  with the most sales in colombia are bavaria empresas publicas de medellin grupo energia bogota oleoducto central grupo eeb and parex resources with profits of   billion   trillion   trillion   trillion and   trillion respectively it is worth noting that the  largest companies according to their profits focused on four macrosectors of the economy  belong to the service sector  to the commercial sector  to the manufacturing sector and  to the mininghydrocarbon sector based on this it can be affirmed that service companies are not only landmarks of the countrys economy but are also the ones that generate the most profits that service companies are the engine of the economy can be explained by two reasons first because they are intensely massive public services reach practically the entire population and second because for the development of networks both energy and sewage large investments are required so they are very economical and professional resources  said jorge londono de la cuesta general manager of epm carlos sepulveda dean of the faculty of economics at the universidad del rosario added that the relevance of service companies in these results reflects the general dynamism of the economy and the sectors that are driving this growth this is correlated with that structure the engines of the productive structure that we have on the one hand and the dynamics of growth on the other  sepulveda also highlighted that the service sector has been growing in recent periods with satisfactory results that helped the growth of the gross domestic product and also has a large number of leading companies in the country behind the companies that most concentrated profits in  are in four regions of the country bogotacundinamarca with  companies antioquia with  costa pacifica entered seven costa atlantica has eight eje cafetero one and santander one industrial and manufacturing sector begins a recovery in its results these results show that the firms belonging to the manufacturing sector do not have so much prominence in colombia the industry was finished colombia increased imports and this means that the colombian industry cannot recover according to gonzalez however sepulveda said that based on these statistics it is not possible to speak that the industry is stagnant but in recovery because this reflects the contribution of the sectors according to the size of the companiesthe mining and hydrocarbons sector was the one that grew the most in revenue in  the contrasts angela montoya president of acolgen last year was very good due to the energy transition process that the

strives for the integrity and safety of the operation he said the executive also added that the results of the operational and commercial strategies that they undertook throughout the year show the

is beginning to recover with the ebitda generated by lubricants in colombia which for  was   million while the profits of ecuador and peru amounted to   million without the acquisition the net profit would have been   million the report added the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol the capital discipline and the efficiency plan are generating new and solid dynamics in all the companys processes as evidenced by the results sylvia escovar president of terpel our results were recognized by the bvc by the risk rating agencies and by those who are the soul of our strategy which are the end consumers those that grew the most in the top  of the largest companies in colombia in terms of revenue there were several variations between  and  in both positive and negative matters the most prominent was kopps comercial while the most affected was quala in the first case revenues grew  and closed  with a total of   billion regarding the second the drop was  and total sales were   billion at the end of the year one of the main reasons for qualas downfall last year is related to the sale of the entire grooming home and personal care portfolio with brands such as ego and savital which became unilever in addition the company was divided internally an operation that led to the creation of quala nova an innovation center dedicated to generating ideas and projects with the potential to reach an international level in addition to kopps comercial which ranked  out of  companies the five companies that grew the most in revenue during  were gestora adminegocios y cia  on the list with  coosalud in position  with  verano energy in box  with  and medimas owner of position  with  precisely one of the curious data on this list has to do with the second largest eps in the country which today has  million members according to the former president of medimas nestor orlando arenas the eps have  years to meet their financial qualification indicators we have been in operation for a year and a half so we have eight and a half years to meet our indicators added the entity which has a total revenue of   billion it must be taken into account that medimas faces a ruling from the administrative court of cundinamarca that would demand the national superintendency of health supersalud to transfer patients from the entity to other companies in a period of no less than six months however this decision is not yet final since the eps has already filed an appeal where it is noted that the supersalud incurs procedural errors where evidence of improvement in services compared to cafesalud was not validated the absorption of the operation of said company cost medimas around   million according to supersociedades figures medimas is the third eps with the highest income in the country only behind nueva eps and coomeva which had sales of   billion and   billion respectively other cases to analyze for  grupo argos came out of the top five of companies with the most income by registering a decrease of  compared to  however the company only fell one square and ranked sixth with   billion  see graph its president jorge mario velasquez commented that they view the  operation with optimism given the behavior that is evident in the economies in which we are present including the united states panama and colombia the concentration of efforts on operational efficiency and capital structure optimization stood outbeyond the figures of the  companies more than a hypothesis of scientific work in the field of social sciences it is an assumption worth checking thanks to the roles and functions of the private sector in colombia that is entrepreneurs and the thousands of people who set up businesses they generate jobs and pay taxes the country has not fallen prey to the populism that has led countries like venezuela and nicaragua to be considered as nonviable or failed states  moreover colombia unlike other neighboring countries of the same degree of development has strong local business groups that compete headtohead with leading multinationals around the world local entrepreneurs win in sectors such as food beverages banking and cement among other highly competitive businesses and in which a competitiveness that is difficult to overcome and imitate has developed this reality is more surprising if we consider that of the economically active population of some  million people  million have formal and informal jobs of these  million are state officials therefore almost  million are employed by the private sector of which  million have a formal job with all social benefits this means that the role of entrepreneurs is fundamental for the wellbeing of the bulk of colombian households the figures are more eloquent if one looks at the millionaire contribution for the payment of taxes derived from business management such is the importance of the national private sector that there must be a social crusade in defense of that management that today is attacked by senseless populisms that want to destroy or discredit the work of doing business a very difficult task in colombia but one that is rewarded by vigorous consumption and a human resource that innovates and works tirelessly with high levels of competence these comments are derived from the results of the almost  wellestablished companies that report their figures to the superintendency of companies each year and from which good results emerge the revenue of the  largest companies during  was   trillion which is  of a gdp close to   trillion profits totaled   trillion which represents  of gdp in   of companies grew sales compared to  that is  companies improved compared to  and some  had drops or remained unchanged compared to  ecopetrol recovered the leadership of the ranking with revenues of   billion and surpassed the second success by a difference of   billion the reason was the high oil prices and the efficiencies in the operation with savings of   billion to enter the  largest you need   trillion and that group represents  of the total income of the  primax entered the select group of the  largest and conconcreto left it is worrying that in this group he did not classify any agriculture or construction they are glimpses of business activity that must be seen beyond the figures of a management and valued as a social group that carries the country on its back no sale or profit is sufficient to assess the role of entrepreneurs in the formation of the country and in their protective role of the economic model that allows us to walk slowly but decisively towards developmentcompanies in the capital represent almost  of total  revenues related article the caribbean region has  of the  companies with the highest income in the country the group of  companies in bogota and cundinamarca generated revenues of   last year  trillion this figure represents almost  of the sales generated by the list of  companies in  in this list the stateowned ecopetrol once again led and dethroned exito which is not only the largest in bogota but in the entire country in the midst of an increase in international oil prices this company recorded revenues of   billion a figure  higher than that reported in the same period of the previous year the company led by felipe bayon also registered a net profit of   billion the highest in recent years which allowed the distribution of   between ordinary and extraordinary dividends per share likewise its assets reached   billion which represented an increase of  compared to the previous year and its equity to   billion  more than in  in second place although quite far from the terpel was the leader which last year had sales of   billion which implied an increase of  compared to the results of  the leader in fuel distribution in the country led by sylvia escobar had a net profit of   million in  that is it fell  compared to the same period of the previous year for its part claro completed the top  of the ranking by reporting revenues of   billion   and bavaria was in fourth place with   billion  also nueva eps ranked in fifth place by adding revenues of   billion which represented an increase of  it should be noted that only among these first five they add up to about   billion that is  of the total income generated by the region and  of the income of the  companies in addition its sales represent around  of the departmental gdp which according to danes records reached   billion in  behind these five largest there are other companies domiciled in bogota such as drummond primax and colombiana de comercio alkosto that last year they obtained   billion   billion and   billion respectively for its part movistar registered sales of   billion carbones del cerrejon of cop  billion and enelcodensa of cop  billion by sectors most of bogotas companies are dedicated to commerce services and manufacturing however those that lead are those in the miningenergy sector and to a lesser extent construction for example in the commerce sector the already named terpel primax and alkosto lead in revenue in services the first on the list are claro nueva eps and codensa and in manufacturing bavaria general motors colmotores and quala stand out for its part in the hydrocarbon mining sector the leader ecopetrol appears followed by drummond and carbones del cerrejon and in the construction area amarilo stands out of the  companies in bogota that enter the   increased their revenues and only  of them fell ecopetrol was the company with the highest profit in  the companies domiciled in bogota and cundinamarca jointly registered a net profit of   billion the one with the highest profit was also the state ecopetrol with   billion however the one that increased its profits the most compared to the previous year was total health growing  followed by gran tierra energy  sanofi aventis de colombia  koba colombia   adminegocios  and vitol colombia ci three sectors contributed more than half of the growth of  last year was one that analysts classify as an economic recovery since the gdp went from  to  this translated into improvements for businesses who saw consumer confidence continue to rebound driving sales and according to the dane figures there were three sectors that were specifically benefited public sector services and commerce which contributed  points to the  growth related article ecopetrol and exito continue to lead the  largest companies in the country within the real sector which added  million jobs ecopetrol with   billion success with   billion terpel with   billion epm with   billion and avianca with   billion ranked as those with the highest revenues eduardo sarmiento director of the economic studies center of the school of engineers pointed out that the growth that this sector had also has its origin in the importance that the orange economy has gained these results do not mean that this sector has the conditions to boost the economy since the activity that has the power to do this is industry as long as it is encouraged but it does show progress in its growth according to the dane the rest of the branches that contributed to boost economic performance excluding financial establishments were education and health with growth of  wholesale and retail trade transport accommodation and food services with  and information and communications with a rise of  the good moment of the latter can be seen in that the firms in the sector reported   billion in revenue the industry grew  and contributed   trillion to gdp the manufacturing industries segment was the third that contributed the most to the  gross domestic product with   trillion this sector went from negative variations in   to an improvement of  in the total for the year other sectors that presented recoveries were mining and quarrying  and construction  both activities improved their figures compared to the results of  when they obtained  and  respectively the state has a stake in  companies worth   billion the  companies in which the nation currently has a stake and that together add up to   billion will undergo an exhaustive review to define which of them can be sold at the moment the goal for this year is to divest assets of   trillion a value that represents around  of gdp and represents  of the value of possible total disposals and it is that as the financing law that was approved last december only managed to cover about   billion of the missing for this  of   billion the government has begun to put together its puzzle to see where it can generate new income and prioritize spending now existing related article colombia prepares process for the sale of participation in isa this means that apart from the already mentioned possible disposals of  of ecopetrol or  of isa the government also has the possibility of privatizing from the development finance company nacional  to finagro  telecaribe  or corabastos  among others we are going to review all state companies some like isa need a valuation because it is a multinational with investments in other countries for example ecopetrol makes its own evaluations and passes them on to us colombians have made investments in assets that generate little maintenance of their value and in some cases even produce costs meanwhile only about   million are invested on average for tertiary roads said the vice minister of finance luis alberto rodriguez for companies in which the nation has a minority stake and that does not exceed  of the shareholding of the company the sale will be made by the state asset collector which is the central de inversiones cisa in the national development plan this entity which is attached to the ministry of finance was given the power to increase its sales cap for state companies which was previously  the contrasts luis alberto rodriguez technical vice minister of finance we are going to review all the assets that the nation has some of these investments are even generating a cost for colombians  there are national participations but municipalities or departments also own some companies what we want is to help them to mobilize these resources so that they can be used in infrastructure health education   assured hernan botero pardo president of cisa in total  of these shares are minority that is in them the nation cannot exercise any type of control as it is just another shareholder in these nonstrategic areas regional companies such as transport terminals villavicencio sogamoso cartagena ibague port companies buenaventura or barranquilla or public televisions telecafe teleantioquia or telepacifico stand out above all in addition there is also a presence in the ituango hydroelectric  the cartagena de indias hotel company  or electricaribe  for its part among the  firms in which the nation has a majority stake the one in charge of selling the assets would be the economic portfolio itself in this group are some such as artesanias  electrohuila  electrocaqueta  or tv andina  these  companies operate in different sectors of the economy but there are some portfolios that are in charge of more than the rest such as the ministry of transportation which has  stateowned companies followed by the ministry of finance  and agriculture  and ict  on the other hand in minas y salud there are four in commerce and interior three in housing two and in labor and the national planning department they have onethe hydrocarbons sector had revenues of   billion and  companies classified the hydrocarbons and fuels sector had a good year in  with  companies among the  best sellers in the country revenues of   billion the companies that showed the best financial results in the sector were ecopetrol and terpel the first one with revenues of   billion the highest in the last five years while the second achieved   billion in third place in the sector was the cartagena refinery reficar with revenues of   billion followed by primax colombia with   billion and ci trafigura petroleum colombia with   billion in the  count exxon mobil and cenit ranked fourth and fifth the reactivation of some fields and the increase in pumping in others would have explained the good moment of the oil companies according to the study ep investment trends in colombia  and perspectives  prepared by the colombian petroleum association acp for the second consecutive year investment in exploration and production increased  compared to  reaching the us   million likewise investment in production increased  which is largely explained by the recovery in international oil prices this allowed that in the second semester the decline in the fields could be compensated and production increased slightly compared to  since it reached  barrels per day the last company that ranked in the sector was talisman with   million which put it in the  club only one company decreased its income of the  firms classified within the  largest only one company decreased its income shell commercialization which fell  from there to arrive all increased at least  and  their sales this being the case of ecodiesel and oleoducto central the ones that increased the most in terms of income are verano energy with an increase of  to   billion emerald  goam  and with  parex resources that sold   billionmore efficiency and better conditions drove  the positivism of businessmen in  rose in line with the rebound in the national economy with growth of  between january and december compared to a  that was quite challenging when the economic apparatus it only expanded  although it was not the desired growth above  all the companies that make up the economic macrosectors improved their revenues and profits as a whole in the case of income the miningenergy sector once again stood out which due to the fall in commodity prices between  and  had had strong effects and was the black point in past reports on the contrary in  this sector grew  in revenues and  in profits in accordance with the best prices of raw materials and contributing the greatest increase in the two indicators but not only this point was fundamental to improve their income with that fall the oil and mining companies accustomed to large budgets and expenses realized that it was time to tighten their belts and reinvent themselves so when the prices rose again commodity prices earnings multiplied the best example is ecopetrol a company that not only recovered the first place among the most sold with   billion surpassing grupo exito by more than   billion which took second place but also learned to be prepared for these situations  this is how it went from needing us   per barrel of brent to make a profit five years ago to requiring only us   now this benefit as the faces behind each company have highlighted is not only one that reaches the shareholders or owners of the companies but one that is distributed in the regions as explained by the manager of epm jorge londono de la cuesta is growth that is synonymous with greater social investment consolidation of new infrastructure projects money for environmental protection and job creation in the regions and it is precisely on this point that this special wants to focus in which the weight of the companies in the regions where they operate is evident and where they not only invest to grow their operations but where they pay taxes which generate greater opportunities for entrepreneurs despite being a year that was still full of challenges due to the uncertainty created by the presidential elections the decline in household consumption and a new financing law it served to consolidate new projects that will begin to generate benefits in what is expected to be a better forum oil and gas what is colombia at stake the reality of the unconventional last week the ministry of mines and energy reported that colombia went from having  years of selfsufficiency in gas to  years for its part oil reserves reached  million barrels after adding  million barrels this figure represents that the country is currently selfsufficient for  years the national panorama is not encouraging which is why the debate on energy security and unconventionals takes more and more relevance the first approach that this government made was the report of the commission of experts on oil and fracking whose conclusions propose the creation of a superintendency of energy affairs faced with this panorama it is necessary to open a space in which the different actors in the sector can confront ideas and discuss measures or decisions in the short medium and long term that must be implemented for the benefit of the country this is why the newspaper la republica will hold on may  starting at  am at the hotel grand hyatt bogota the forum oil and gas what is colombia at stake the opening and installation conference will be given by the minister of mines and energy maria fernanda suarez and will be about the future of oil in the country immediately afterwards felipe bayon president of ecopetrol will speak about energy security and unconventionals it should be noted that the oil company was the one with the highest operating income during  according to the list published by the superintendency of companies another participant is carlos felipe cordoba comptroller general who will give the conference the rules of the game for fracking as a result of the studies and findings that the control body has and that are the fundamental part for the regulation of unconventional practices extraction and exploration known as fracking precisely this will be the central theme of the first panel of the day in which fernando sarria president of exxonmobil exploration colombia carlos vargas member of the commission of experts for the exploration of unconventional deposits and juan felipe neira researcher department of miningenergy law of the externado de colombia university will try to give an answer to is colombia ready to do fracking francisco jose lloreda mera acp president will speak about the legacy of the unconventional oilfields for colombia the day will conclude with the panel demystifying fracking which will have as panelists brigitte baptiste director of the alexander von humboldt biological resources research institute leonardo donado member of the commission of experts for the exploration of unconventional deposits alberto garcia vice president of the hydrocarbons and mineral exploration division of drummond ltd juan pablo ruiz environmental economist member of the commission of experts for the exploration of unconventional deposits fracking is particularly relevant at this time due to the countrys low gas reserves and the importance of having higher oil yields the discussion of whether it should be allowed has to take place in spaces of confrontation of positions in favor of benefiting colombiaif we imported the capacity of reficar and barranca it would be necessary to allocate us   million a year the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon in the forolr oil and gas what is colombia at stake began his presentation by reflecting on the role of the first  years of the industry which serve to have a look at the possibilities that exist to build forward since it is a sector that contributes a lot to the country and not only monetary way but in poverty reduction in the last four years alone the company has delivered   billion to the government in royalties taxes etc which served to close the gaps  it is because of these contributions that from ecopetrol bayon indicated that it has a very clear growth strategy to continue contributing this is based on three lines protection of the cash be efficient in reducing costs that each dollar has a return to shareholders and growth of reserves and production on the first points he summarized that with the transformation program they have saved more than   billion and in  with a price of us   which is  less than in  of more than us   we generated the largest ebitda in history revenues of   billion and a profit of   billion which is more than the last four years  already on the point of reserves and selfsufficiency he first recalled that in  more than  was replaced where the price helped but in  they replaced more than  without taking the price into account moving forward the idea is to replace at least  of the reserves each year since at present the crude oil reserves are  years and the gas reserves are  years and it is necessary to analyze two effects one that is not we have new commercial discoveries and that in the case of gas consumption has risen and unlike oil in addition to requiring technicalcommercial development sales contracts are required which makes it more difficult explained bayon at this point and remembering that the energy matrix in colombia depends on  crude oil and  gas with  barrels a day it is what do we have to do to remain selfsufficient and he added that the question is important so as not to go back to the  or  when it was time to import oil since if today we had to import the cargo from cartagena and barranca we would have to allocate us   million every year and where do we get those   billion here he explained that a good answer is the unconventional ones where not only the production would be helped but the environment itself at this point he gave the example of the reduction of emissions of almost  in the united states between  and  being the country that lowered  the most in that period and largely due to the unconventional revolution since it replaced coal with gas in colombia in  years we have produced  of what the country has consumed close to  billion barrels and we believe that we can reach  and  much using technologies such as injection of gas water or polymers  to get more out of the fields we have added bayon with this he has accounts where after  years of gas reserves with unconventionals between four or  more years can be added it is a wide range but we have to look at what is commercial and what is worth taking out however the figure serves to look at the magnitude of the potential because current reserves can be multiplied by up to  and here we have identified areas such as cesar rancheria catatumbo which would have  or  of those that exist today and the middle magdalena valley  regarding oil he added that these fields also have a very important potential and the nearly  million barrels that we have could be multiplied by four finally on the fracking pilots which would shed light on the appropriate methods and where us   million will be invested bayon added that it is time to look at how to benefit the communities so that they have participation this would be in addition to royalties and taxes perhaps development costs should be considered a contribution he also pointed out that a quality system should be allowed to do permanent monitoring and it should be based on technology so that information is always available as a third point that there be constant technical tables since it is a subject that requires a lot of education and pedagogy here he stressed that it is important to remind people that we are not going to compete with the drinking water sources of the communities since we can use industrial water and we are testing itwithout reserves a year   billion would be spent on imports felipe bayon the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon pointed out in his presentation at the lr forum that it is necessary to analyze the benefits for the country and the need for oil consumption in colombia and the world even in  years to take the necessary decisions to expand the countrys reserves and not have in the future to import oil to meet the needs which today reach about  barrels of crude per day if the country loses selfsufficiency as happened between  and  crude would have to be imported again incurring costs of about   billion per year this without counting the resources that would stop entering the government which in the last years of ecopetrol have been   billion in royalties taxes dividends etc the idea of the company is to replace at least  of the reserves every year since currently the crude oil reserves are  years and the gas reserves are  years however bayon added that to boost these numbers a primary source would be offshore and unconventional this is fundamental because the energy matrix in colombia depends on  of petroleum derivatives and  of natural gas and the situation will not change according to a study by bp energy in  renewables worldwide will only supply   of consumption and oil and gas will continue to mean  said bayon at this point from the use of fracking he also highlighted the benefits for the environment and used the example of the reduction of emissions of almost  in the united states between  and  being the country that reduced  the most in that period and largely because of the fracking revolution as it replaced coal with natural gas in colombia in  years we have produced  of what the country has consumed almost  billion barrels and we believe that we can reach  or  using technologies such as injection of gas water or polymers to get more out of the fields we have  added the president of ecopetrol with this the company has an account where after  years of gas reserves with unconventionals between four or  more years can be added it is a wide range but it is necessary to look at what is commercial and what is worth taking out but the figure serves to look at the magnitude of the potential where current reserves can be multiplied by up to six and here we have identified areas such as cesarrancheria catatumbo which would have  or  of what exists today and the middle magdalena valley  in oil he added that these fields have the potential to quadruple current reserves this is how ecopetrols pilot projects progress in unconventionals regarding the fracking pilots where they will invest us   million bayon said that it is time to look at how to benefit the communities this would be in addition to royalties and taxes perhaps it is time to include a contribution in the development costs we are analyzing that  he also said that a quality system should be allowed to do permanent monitoring and as a third point the inclusion of technical tables since it is an issue that requires pedagogythe general comptrollers office recovered   million for fiscal damage caused to ecopetrol the office of the comptroller general of the republic reported that as a result of a fiscal damage generated by the company equion energia limited to ecopetrol the control entity recovered   million after a ruling that was finalized by the head of the entity the comptroller carlos felipe cordoba  the ruling for fiscal responsibility was ratified after after the special investigations unit against corruption obtained full compensation for an unjustified payment that the state oil company had made to equion energia limited for drilling services in the piedemonte oil project according to the control body for the exploitation of the florena well the operator of the association contract signed with ecopetrol contracted the use of a drill which it left on standby for seven months without any justification causing costs for the availability of the same  situation that led to the ruling in the first instance likewise the comptrollers office assured that ecopetrol had to pay administration expenses that were already included in the contract rates and for which it had no obligation finally cordoba confirmed this ruling in the second instance and the company compensated the damages caused to the state by this contract the comptrollers office confirmed that the payment was made on may  equion energia limited returned   million to ecopetrol due to a tax ruling thanks to the ratification of a tax ruling by the comptroller general of the republic the state oil company ecopetrol recovered   million from an unjustified payment to equion energia limited a company with which it had contracted the use of a drilling rig in the piedemonte oil project  casanare the control body found that for the exploration of the florena well equion operator of the association contract signed with ecopetrol although it did comply with the obligation to contract the drill left it inactive for seven months without any justification which generated costs for its availability to the company likewise the comptrollers office assured that ecopetrol had to pay administration expenses that were already included in the contract rates and in relation to which it had no obligation whatsoever which would have generated financial damage to the company and therefore for the state based on these facts the comptroller general carlos felipe cordoba confirmed in second instance the ruling with fiscal responsibility for these facts after which the special investigations unit against corruption of the entity proceeded to obtain payment for ecopetrol the which became effective on may   juliana ramirez bermeo intersectoral delegate comptroller of said unit explained that the payment of equion was made on behalf of the national treasury and that since the association contract that that company entered into with ecopetrol it is still in force and one of the consequences of the declaration is the inclusion of those responsible in the fiscal responsibility bulletin  if the payment had not been made they would be unable to contract for its part equion also ruled and assured that the payment referred by the comptroller corresponds to a parking fee for the drill a practice that according to the company in addition to being widely used allows to reduce or redistribute the risks associated with the execution of hydrocarbon exploration and production projects whose uncertainties are usually high  finally equion assured that although it does not agree with the concept of the comptroller the company has complied with the law and for this reason made the payment however it remained firm in that it is not subject to fiscal responsibilityqualifier fitch ratings changed ecopetrols outlook from stable to negative after moodys raised colombias outlook and fitch ratings downgraded it last week ecopetrol reported through the financial superintendency that the rating agency fitch changed ecopetrols outlook from stable to negative as a result of the change from the perspective of the republic of colombia  through this channel ecopetrol also assured that fitch ratings affirmed ecopetrols credit rating at bbb with investment grade in fact he assured that all these adjustments were in line with the qualifications of the national government last week risk rating agency moodys affirmed colombias  rating but changed the outlook from negative to stable according to them the recovery of economic activity and fiscal consolidation efforts by the public administration were taken into account in contrast to this good news minutes after this release fitch affirmed colombias longterm foreign

agency fitch ratings announced yesterday that it changed the outlook of the state oil company ecopetrol from stable to negative this as a result of the change to the perspective of colombia as detailed by the company through the financial superintendency superfinanciera the company led by felipe bayon also commented that fitch ratings affirmed ecopetrols credit rating at bbb with investment grade in turn he commented that all these adjustments were made in line with the national governments ratings despite this the oil company was the company that recorded the most income and profits during  closing with a total of   billion and   billion respectively when looking at the rating agencys report on colombia it should be noted that the outlook changed from stable to negative which caused ecopetrol to drop as a domino effect was generated after the change in the economys note last week in its analysis of the countrys performance the rating agency detailed aspects such as risks in fiscal consolidation and the trajectory of government debt as well as the weakening of the credibility of fiscal policy and the increase in risks due to external imbalances the contrasts juan david ballen director of analysis and statistics of the brokerage firm it is common for this to happen because there cannot be assets less risky than the country itself probably some financial ones will follow but it is something natural  fitch also noted that it expects that the start of the reduction in government tax revenues in  coupled with other factors will make a necessary shortterm fiscal adjustment to stabilize and scale debt against gdp the company also referred to aspects such as the financing law approved at the end of last year and argued in its report that it will weaken the governments income in addition he explained that many key points were removed which led to half of the revenue that was originally envisioned being collected however other credit ratings such as moodys gave positive outlook for the country last week at which point they affirmed colombias  rating but changed the outlook from negative to stable as they commented when giving the verdict factors such as the recovery of economic activity and fiscal consolidation efforts by the public administration were taken into account after the results disclosed by fitch ratings and moodys the minister of

for the exploration and production of oil and gas in the country the national hydrocarbons agency anh already has a strategy ready to reactivate the sector this is the new permanent area allocation process ppaa which will open its offers next week june  with the aim that as of july  the first contracts will begin to be signed the  continental blocks that will go on the market will be the starting point for the reactivation of the oil industry this new round will have  areas in the eastern plains five in the magdalena valley and two in the caribbean sea although each of these blocks have a different vocation be it gas or oil the companies that enter to compete in the process will have the opportunity to propose for various areas luis miguel morelli president of the national hydrocarbons agency explained that with the offers that materialize in the  areas a minimum investment of us   million is expected which would be added to the us   million that are already committed if the nine offshore contracts that are pending  morelli explained that in these  blocks there are estimated to be  billion barrels this scenario would suit the country very well because today the gas

exploratory projects and optimization of transport routes among other initiatives the company said in a statement for this the company also indicated that the digital transformation will be a key piece since ecopetrol already has  robots and  initiatives of artificial intelligence blockchain and big data to increase productivity in this sense the company led by felipe bayon announced that it defined a digital agenda with more than  initiatives that will be developed in the next five years and that are based on the use of artificial intelligence blockchain and big data among others

felipe bayon president of ecopetrol digital transformation has become one of the most important elements for generating savings thanks to it we have identified greater efficiencies  specifically the differentiating element of ecopetrols transformation is based on the digital part for which an agenda has already been defined with more than  initiatives that will be developed in the next five years based on the use of artificial intelligence the blockchain and big data all of them within the socalled fourth industrial revolution at the moment the company already has more than  robots working six products developed in agile methodologies in its own digital factory and  datamarts that will accelerate data analysis anything that is introducing technology to optimize processes and gain effectiveness will be beneficial for the company the fourth revolution allows operations to be made more efficient to reduce times and this is reflected in costs said julio cesar vera former president of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet in addition another novelty that this new transformation program brings is the generation of environments to stimulate creativity innovation and identification of structural efficiencies by teams of group workers likewise the company indicated that it will focus on commercial and marketing transformation in order to be more competitive in

that it is the first time that it has entered the  companies with the greatest capacity to attract and retain talent during the  years of validity of the merco list it is also important to note that of the seven companies that entered the top  this year two are universities this trend is repeated in the general list as companies in the education sector reach  in total ranking as the niche with the most players in the ranking along with food which has the same number one of the factors that stand out the most from the list is that approximately  of the companies included are of colombian origin in this regard the general director of merco manuel sevillano highlighted that colombian companies not only have a very good reputation for different interest groups but also make colombia the nation that incorporates the most companies into the ranking of the  where the business monitor makes presence in turn the executive added that colombia has the peculiarity that it has a highly reputed university system a factor that is not seen in other countries in the same way another important point to highlight is the evolution of the companies in the last year since as well as there were important increases there were also pronounced falls in the first case ibm moved up  positions from  to  while in the second bayer fell  squares going from  to  moving to the top  of the list the

us   million will be made here so it is a good sign of the oil reactivation that is being seen in the industry explained luis miguel morelli president of the anh who clarified of this total eight blocks have a vocation for oil and only two for gas  although initially there were  blocks up for auction morelli explained that for now  will be signed while the counter offer from frontera is analyzed who presented a proposal for the valle inferior del magdalena  area which is in the bid with geopark the remaining nine said the official will go to the next auction in october this with the

the  million that would be added with the production of the new blocks todays session marks a good start to the permanent process for the assignment of areas the most important thing is that parallel

registered an average daily production of  barrels with a water cut of less than  the final depth reached was  feet this finding is part of ecopetrols strategy to increase reserves which includes as one of its focuses exploring areas near production fields in this case the boranda wells are located in the producing strip of the pavascachira fields to the northeast and aullador and cristalina to the southwest explained alberto consuegra executive vice president of ecopetrol in this block parex resources has a  stake while ecopetrol owns the other ecopetrol and parex reported the discovery of

issued by the agency the  st well has been closed to carry out the analysis of the pressure buildup the operator expects to resume production at the end of july he reported this is how the reactivation of the industry is going the new discoveries of the oil companies add to the strategy of the national hydrocarbons agency in which it aims to sign around  oil contracts this year for the exploration and production of new fields after signing five offshore contracts in the first half the oil authority will launch new areas in the eastern plains and the middle magdalena valley with this it is expected that crude oil reserves will increase by up to  million in the next four or five yearsfor the disposal process colombia analyzes its participation in  companies colombia began a gradual process to sell its stake in  companies and obtain at least   trillion us   million each year that it will seek to invest in more profitable assets said a senior official from the ministry of finance these are companies in the energy telecommunications transportation and financial sectors in which the state has minority stakes that is they do not exceed  of the share ownership the director of public credit of the ministry of finance cesar arias told reuters that the states participation in the more than  public and private companies has an estimated value of   billion in market value and that last year they generated a return of around of  million dollars which he described as very low the idea of these resources is not that they finance current spending of the nation but rather that it be replaced by investment that is more profitable arias said in an interview on tuesday afternoon it is a strategy that seeks to provide some resources that are necessary to keep public investment at optimal levels he explained although colombia faces budget difficulties to cover its needs the public credit director said that the resources obtained from the privatizations which can reach  of the gross domestic product annually will not be used to cover expenses but rather they will invest in more profitable sectors such as infrastructure and clean energy the finance ministry published a draft decree in early july to receive comments on the sale plan while sending congress a list of the companies in which it has a stake that could be privatized clear road the sale of companies with low profitability has already been approved by congress as part of president ivan duques national development plan which establishes the main economic and social goals for the next four years the government has share control over oil company ecopetrol and energy transportation telecommunications and infrastructure conglomerate isa which for now are not included in the sale plans according to the draft decree however the eventual sale of share packages in companies such as ecopetrol and isa may face resistance in congress where the government does not have a majority because many legislators and the market consider them to be companies that generate good profitability and are leaders in their sectors on the other hand arias said that he is attentive to the financial needs of  by remembering that  is covered after the country successfully placed a   billion bond in january the government must present its  spending budget to congress and legislators must debate and approve it the budget approved by congress for  was  billion pesos  million dollars recently the ministry of finance set a goal of issuing domestic debt securities for next year for  trillion pesos and issuance of external bonds for  billion dollars our number one priority and challenge will once again be to contribute to the financing of that budget in  and continue to improve our debt profile maintain the confidence of local and foreign investors in our market said ariasfrontera energy won the last of the  contracts for the first oil assignment starting today the national hydrocarbons agency anh will initiate the signing of the first contracts of the permanent process of allocation of areas ppaa after knowing that frontera energy managed to win the bid for the lower magdalena valley vim  before geopark the entity indicated that this week and the next the  blocks of the first auction will be finalized in order to accelerate the reactivation of the sector the award to frontera energy of the area located in magdalena medio was due to the fact that according to the entity geopark did not present a reply to improve the counter offer this was confirmed by luis miguel morelli president of the anh who assured that today four contracts will be signed with hocol and the temporary union between hocol and geopark these  contracts from the first auction are in addition to the five offshore that were signed at the beginning of the year with this  contracts in total would be reached  the president of the agency also highlighted that in the middle of this process  solutions for incorporating areas were received after debugging the anh reported that  blocks are already ready which will come out in the next auction this is expected to be in september depending on the schedule that is defined in total there will be  blocks that we will offer in september these are in addition to the  we offered at the beginning of the year by the end of  we will offer  blocks to investors of which we expect to sign at least  contracts said the official diego mesa vice minister of energy stressed that this will allow greater investment in the industry in fact he confirmed that all the measures are in accordance with what was proposed by the government which is committed to four fundamental axes one is the reactivation of the continental areas two we have the offshore issue three a plan to improve the enhanced recovery and finally we have the issue of unconventional deposits which as the country knows has been worked on in a very prudent manner  he said these new continental areas are expected to add around  billion barrels of crude to the countrys reserves these would be added to the  million that currently exist a situation that would allow the country in a horizon of four or five years to reach almost  million barrels in selfsufficiency the announcement of the signing of these contracts took place within the framework of the oil  gas congress held in bogota in this event beyond talking about the reactivation several requests were also made one of them was from naturgas who asked that natural gas also need to be taken into account in the next sitp tender gas technology has a benefit very similar to electric mobility the request we are making to the bogota mayors office is that natural gas be included in the next tender that will open the sitp bus district said orlando cabrales president of naturgasla anla stopped fracking pilot environmental license the national authority for environmental licenses anla suspended the process for the environmental license necessary to carry out the first fracking pilot in the country designed to take place between puerto wilches and barrancabermeja in santander this procedure had been carried out by ecopetrol la anla determined the suspension through a letter sent to the president of the company felipe bayon based on the fact that the council of state issued a decision last november that provisionally suspends norms for fracking according to the environmental authority communicated to the oil company the decision will remain until the current technical regulation applicable to unconventional fields allows continuity of the referred request for environmental licensing evaluation within the framework of the principle of sustainable development la anla also indicated through the letter that although the standards that regulate environmental licensing in colombia are main independent and autonomous they could not be applied asynchronously from those that authorize regulate establish or frame minimum technical procedures  as is the case with fracking regulations previously anla had also suspended other licenses related to hydraulic fracturing because in march of this year it requested that the procedures for the environmental licenses of two fracking projects of conocophillips and canacol energy both located in the south of the cesar department be filedin the

explorations are some of the cards that the oil companies in the region have played to reach a point of efficiency that allows them to succeed one more year amid the volatility of oil prices the global economy in the last year has shown signs of weakness which clearly translate into a slowdown in investment including that of oil companies one of the most recent examples is the announcements of pemex the mexican state company that in the first quarter of this year presented losses of us   million to counter this blow one of the strategies was to carry out the merger of pemex exploracion y produccion pep with drilling and services pps and of pemex transformacion industrial tri with ethylene its brazilian competitor petrobras which reported revenues of us   million has also moved its chips to optimize the operation one of them is that it chose to sell  of its stake in its chain of gasoline stations with which it hopes to obtain us   billion in addition to this it reported the sale of four of its refineries including landulpho alves rlam president getulio vargas repar and alberto pasqualini refap to the north of the region petroleos de venezuela pdvsa reached extreme measures such as the closure of certain fields that are not so profitable this is in addition to other problems such as facing electrical failures in the largest refining complex amuay and cardon part of the paraguana refining center which already operates below its installed capacity and at the other extreme financial problems and judicial investigations against the argentine oil company ypf filed by petersen energia inversora have also been an obstacle for the sector to have a broad economic advance julian cardenas senior protection analyst explained that economic weakness is a threat but on the one hand we see that central banks can act to contain the slowdown and avoid a collapse in commodity prices a response from a central bank like the federal reserve of the united states could eventually translate into dollar weakness which in turn nominally would have a favorable effect on prices for example crude oil the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol ecopetrol is a solid company that emerged strengthened from the low price crisis thanks to a successful transformation process that led us to rethink the way we do things julian cardenas senior protection analyst due to the specific situation that ecopetrol experienced during the collapse of the oil price in  it had to stop investment which has been reactivated in recent years unlike the others felipe bayon president of ecopetrol stated that this is a company that emerged strengthened from the low price crisis thanks to a successful transformation process that led us to rethink the way we do things between  when the company began its transformation program and the first quarter of  structural efficiencies equivalent to   billion were achieved  strategies such as the signing of two exploration and production contracts in the colombian caribbean the exploratory success in the  delimiting well and interest in offshore made the colombian company report revenues of us   billion in the first quarter of this yearcolombia remains afloat in the region despite the struggles of the big oil companies according to an article published by the economist newspaper colombia would stay afloat fighting to maintain its position in oil production in the region according to the newspaper the country would stand out in an important point in the region and is due to the state company ecopetrol the changes obtained in the alvaro uribe government and the adjustments in selfsufficiency in some ways the regions brightest spot has been colombia alvaro uribe president from  to  undertook the restructuring of ecopetrol his changes included the creation of an independent regulator and the inclusion of  of the shares of ecopetrol who provided an infusion of capital that helped the company recruit better managers quoted the london newspaper likewise it refers to how felipe bayon pardo former senior executive of bp a british oil giant was hired in  who became chief in  after the slowdown in oil prices at the end of  ecopetrol reduced expenses when prices rose expenses increased although more slowly than in mexico the report said however reference is made to the fact that ecopetrols reserves would be decreasing to empower them it is partnering with big international oil companies and investing   million in fracking success is not assured not in colombia or anywhere else the international energy agency an intergovernmental forecaster predicted that brazilian production would boom last year but production declined because new oil fields were slow to start production and mature ones fell the newspaper highlights despite their different corporate forms most of latin americas oil giants the report highlights share a big problem in common and it has been the mismanagement of cash in the good old days that included pouring too much money into the government coffers and too little in investment for future growth in this sense it refers to the fact that in  when the international price of oil reached us   per barrel the mexican pemex transferred approximately half of its resources to the government of mexico or that despite the increase in crude prices petrobras saw how the price of its shares fell because it was burdened with debt and invested in marginal projects the report also indicates that another common problem is that some politicians and executives used companies as personal piggy banks because of this the scandals shook petrobras petroecuador and pemex as well as pdvsadrummond conocophillips and exxon will discuss fracking different investigations have shown the potential of the department of cesar to produce alternative energies which is why it is necessary to promote projects that further promote and exploit the potential of the area this is one of the tasks that companies and entities in the sector such as drummond ecopetrol conocophillips exxon naturgas the ministry of mines and energy and the national hydrocarbons agency among others have set themselves who seek opportunities in nonoil fields conventional to promote more investment in the country a debate on the future of national energy will take place today in valledupar at the forum energy development of cesar how does it contribute to national energy security  carried out by the lr in order to discuss the future of the sector in the discussion the experts will discuss topics such as fracking as well as the selfsupply of natural gas taking into account the reduction in reserves and national energy securitythe ecopetrol company shows its face in regional oil production a recent investigation by the economist newspaper revealed that colombia would stay afloat against other countries to maintain oil production in the region according to the newspaper the consolidation that the stateowned ecopetrol has achieved and the governments selfsufficiency adjustments would allow the colombian hydrocarbons sector to pull off the entire south american industry the economist explains in its report that all this occurs due to the bad corporate management that has been seen in several oil companies such as pemex mexico pdvsa venezuela petrobras brazil and perupetro peru in fact colombia would remain afloat before all these countries because since the government of alvaro uribe from  to  the restructuring of ecopetrol was undertaken in which the sale of  of the shares and the organizational culture that has made it possible to recruit better managers this is the case of felipe bayon pardo who since he took office has chosen to boost savings optimize investments and diversify his portfolio all this is evident in the more than us   million that the company plans to invest in its expansion plan until  in which it also has us   million for the research and development of nonconventional reservoirs ync through hydraulic fracturing or frackingat the end of the semester the number of drills in operation rose  the chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol reported that in june the number of drilling rigs in operation experienced an expansion of seven rigs to reach  this figure generated an annual growth of  in the rigs operating if compared to june of last year when there were  the increase for this month was explained by the update in the information of a company that had not reported for about two years and by two new contracts the chamber also announced that there was an advance in the contracted drills since in june  they were at  and now they are at  these statistics reflect that the percentage of the drills operating based on the contracted ones is at a level of   one percentage point above what was registered last year at the same time regarding the function of the drills of the  equipment in existence consolidated for june  were used for drilling work of which  were reported as contracted and  in operation the operating  total equipment ratio for drills with this function in this month of the year was  explained the campetrol report on the side of drills destined for workover functions in june  were destined for this activity here there are  registered as contracted and  are in operation finally the report recorded the international operation where it is seen that the drilling rigs that were reported active throughout the world reached authorize the transfer of  of the saturno block in brazil to ecopetrol ecopetrol reported that the brazilian ministry of mines and energy authorized the transfer of  of the saturno block located in the santos basin to the subordinate ecopetrol oleo e gas brasil the authorization was published in the official gazette of brazil yesterday july  according to the state oil company as reported in a statement dated december  last year ecopetrol signed an agreement with the aforementioned oil companies to obtain a  stake in the block it is due to this situation that in the last hours the ministry of mines and energy finalized said authorization the saturno block was assigned to shell and chevron on september  in the fifth presalt round carried out by the national petroleum natural gas and biofuels agency of brazil anp in this new composition ecopetrol remains with  of the blocks interests while shell operator and chevron each retain  of the total this block is added to the participation that ecopetrol has in another presal block called paubrasil in which it has  and is a partner of the companies china national offshore oil corporation cnooc and bp with these two blocks ecopetrol consolidates its presence in five blocks in brazil in the santos foz de amazonas potiguar and ceara basinsthe brazilian ministry of energy authorized the transfer of  of the saturno block to ecopetrol related article the company ecopetrol shows its face in regional oil production the brazilian ministry of mines and energy authorized the transfer of  of the saturno block located in the santos basin some  kilometers southeast of sao paulo to the subsidiary of ecopetrol in that country ecopetrol oleo e gas brasil owners of this percentage were the companies shell brasil petroleo ltda and chevron brasil oleo e gas ltda they were assigned on september  in the fifth presalt round carried out by the national petroleum natural gas and biofuels agency of brazil anp however as reported last december the state oil company signed an agreement with them to obtain a stake in the block now in the new composition the company led by felipe bayon will retain  of the blocks interests while shell operator and chevron will each keep  of the total with this block the local oil company consolidates its presence in brazil where it already has a  stake in another presal block called paubrasil likewise it is also a partner of the companies china national offshore oil corporation cnooc and bpecopetrol operates  out of every  barrels of oil produced in the country the oil industry has managed to recover in  proof of this is that production is already approaching  barrels per day a figure that has not reached since may  this has been supported in part by the average price of a barrel which it has remained between us   and us   a situation that especially favors ecopetrol which accounts for a brent at us   and reported profits of   billion in the first quarter according to the latest figures from the national hydrocarbons agency anh which classifies oil fields according to their operator of the  average barrels per day bpdc that were produced in may ecopetrol contributed  equivalent to  of the production this means that for every  barrels that the fields in colombia generate the company is responsible for almost  it should be clarified that this is by operation since there are also fields of the company that other companies operate so by property the contribution to the national production that ecopetrol makes reaches  of the total frontera energy a canadian company for the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas is the second in the colombian market since it contributes nine out of every  barrels produced per month and in may it reached  bpdc currently other major players in the national oil scene are geopark which in may contributed  of national production after generating  bpdc in the fields it operates occidental de colombia which with  barrels appears as the fourth national producer with  of the total and equion energia limited which represents  of production and according to the anh generated  bpdc in may other companies that are currently setting the standard are gran tierra energy whose operation generated  barrels in may  mansarovar which with  bpdc contributes  and hocol which generated  barrels representing   alfonso navarro executive director of the colombian association of petroleum engineers acipet assures that within the industry reactivation plan having new exploration areas the possibility of expanding its assets in the country and remaining with its investments and new business rules motivates the operating companies to carry out the drilling task in exploratory blocks  the market five years ago although the main entry in the colombian oil industry is ecopetrol the productive participation of the company five years ago only represented  of the total because of the  barrels that were produced in may  the oil company it only generated  bpdc this means that since  the company not only increased its market share by  points but also increased its production by  felipe bayon president of ecopetrol highlighted that the companys production has been increasing despite the attacks on the infrastructure in the first quarter of the year the company produced  barrels per day equivalent a result that according to bayon reflects the positive response of the fields with primary and secondary recovery the development of gas markets and the effective execution of the investment plan  the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol in the first quarter of   development wells were completed and an average of  drills were in operation  more than those used in the first quarter of  alfonso navarro executive director of acipet the high quality standards knowledge of the areas and having facilities set up give space for greater openness for foreign operators one of the most relevant changes in the top five is that of second place this is because on the map five years ago meta petroleum a pacific subsidiary today frontera energy weighed  of production however the loss of rubiales an emblematic field and other losses have meant a decrease of   in production so that despite following second its participation is only  at the end of the first semester there were  drills operating according to campetrol according to the most recent report on drills published by the colombian chamber of petroleum goods and services campetrol at the end of the first half of the year there were  drills in operation which it meant an increase of seven units compared to the  that were reported in may as of june ecopetrol had  drills in operation on the other hand frontera energys number of active drills is currently eight while equion limited has only one rig as of may geopark reported four drills two drills and two for completion the projection is that they continue to riseecopetrol signs a contract to search for gas en bloc in la guajira and will

contemplated in the development plan ecopetrols total payment is equivalent to us   million in a competitive transaction compared to comparable operations carried out in the market in recent years the company explained in a statement related article unconventional projects would create  jobs the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon stressed that this is a milestone for ecopetrol because we entered the major leagues of nonconventional reservoirs we will increase our reserves and production and we will strengthen our knowledge of this technology together with a toplevel partner it is a fundamental step to advance on the path of sustainability and profitable growth that we have traced for more than two years with the aim of generating more resources for our shareholders and all colombians  the immediate consequences of the alliance is that once the transaction is completed ecopetrol will be able to add  million barrels of oil equivalent mbpe to its proven reserves with which if the transaction concludes at the end of this year as planned  the oil company would see a  increase in its reserves compared to the figure with which it closed  in terms of production  the alliance is expected to add  barrels a day to ecopetrol over the next decade reaching a peak of  barrels a day in  in addition the company highlighted that it allows increasing the participation of light crude close to  degrees api in average to balance the ecopetrol groups production matrix now concentrated in heavy crude oil  in addition to this ecopetrol indicated that this alliance will allow it to learn more about the exploitation of unconventional deposits and highlighted it contemplates a strong component of knowledge and technology transfer since company personnel will participate directly in activities in the country where the most has developed such technology successfully  finally ecopetrol indicated that in order to make the operation viable the company overturned its subsidiaries in the united states since it created ecopetrol permian llc and constituted ecopetrol usa inc the company in charge of the consolidation of ecopetrol permian llc and the subsidiary ecopetrol america

with occidental in the united states ecopetrol continues to diversify its investment portfolio and will now bet on the unconventional reservoirs ync in the united states yesterday the colombian oil company announced a strategic alliance with occidental petroleum corp with the aim of executing a joint development plan for ync in the permian basin located in the state of texas this is the largest acquisition in its history that will allow it to reach a net production of up to  barrels per day kboed in the future and incorporate proven reserves of  million barrels the union of ecopetrol and occidental will allow the companies to strengthen their knowledge in the evaluation development and exploitation of ync for this association which marks a new milestone in the relationship of more than  years between the two companies occidental will have a  stake while the colombian company will have  of the alliance occidentals experience in the production of crude oil through hydraulic fracturing or fracking added to the more than  barrels of oil it reached in the first half of this year with this technique will allow ecopetrol to strengthen its experience in these technologies and boost their investments in that country this was confirmed by felipe bayon president of ecopetrol who assured that he is pleased to announce an alliance that is aligned with the strategy of the oil company this is a milestone for ecopetrol because we entered the major leagues of the ync we will increase our reserves and production and we will consolidate our knowledge in this technology together with a first level partner it is a fundamental step to advance on the path of sustainability and profitable growth that we have traced for more than two years  explained the manager ecopetrols involvement in this union has an initial payment of  at the closing of the transaction and another  in carry in other words investment deferred over time in activities contemplated in the development plan according to the company this remuneration is equivalent to us   million in a competitive transaction compared to comparable operations carried out in the market in recent years beyond the contribution knowledge and experience that occidental will provide in ync to ecopetrol the company also estimates that at the close of the transaction projected for before the end of  proven reserves of around  million barrels of crude could be incorporated a figure that would represent an approximate increase of  compared to the reserves it presented in  which closed at  million according to its financial report last year to these contributions it would also be added that this alliance would give ecopetrol the possibility to increase production progressively until  to the point of reaching a net production for the state company in the alliance that is estimated at about  barrels per day it is very productive for the company that it can make these alliances first because it allows you to go hand in hand with a very large partner such as occidental second it is one of the basins with the highest productivity and prospectivity in terms of unconventional reservoirs in the united states and thirdly it allows them to acquire an experience curve to bring it to colombia  explained julio cesar vera expert consultant and former president of acipet to make the operation viable ecopetrol also reported that it created ecopetrol permian llc in turn it established ecopetrol usa inc which will be in charge of the consolidation of ecopetrol permian llc the new company focused on ync and the subsidiary ecopetrol america llc which will continue to manage the operations of the gulf of mexico the united states where the colombian oil company already produces more than  kboed the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol this is a milestone for ecopetrol because we entered the major leagues of nonconventional reservoirs and we will increase our reserves and production julio cesar vera former president of acipet these alliances not only allow the company to increase the portfolio of projects but also give it the possibility of increasing new reserves however it is important to note that the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals in the united states likewise for the management of this business the colombian oil company received technical advice from degolyer and macnaughton financial advice from credit suisse securities usa llc and legal advice from shearman  sterling with this commitment of the company ecopetrol continues to strengthen its presence in the american continent according to the company this transaction is aligned with the strategic priorities of the  business plan which are focused under an investment ranging from us   million to us   million in the growth of reserves and production in greater exploration in offshore areas in recovery improvement and in ync argos continues to have the largest investment by a colombian company in the united states the signing of this strategic alliance with occidental petroleum corp oxy does not represent the largest purchase of a colombian company in the united states this is currently held by the cement industry company cementos argos which is the largest local investor in the united states having the martinsburg cement plant in west virginia and other acquisitions in companies such as rmcc southern star lafarge and vulcan among others and that exceed us   million these movements were made in different yearswith fracking in the united states ecopetrols reserves would be a minimum of seven years in  the strategic alliance of ecopetrol and occidental petroleum corp to execute a joint plan for the development of unconventional reservoirs ync in the permian basin in the state of texas the united states will allow the state oil company to raise its crude reserves to a minimum of seven years in  this was confirmed by the president of the company felipe bayon who assured that the  million barrels that fracking will bring in permian they will help to grow reserves from  years to more than seven years  years are the current reserves and with this  years can be incorporated if we replace all of this years production it allows in one year to increase  of the production in one year a year we produce  million barrels this allows us to incorporate  million barrels  he said he assured that the us   million will be paid with ecopetrols cash in fact he stressed that they are ready to start the first research pilots in colombia but that they are awaiting the decision of the council of state this transaction is aligned with the strategic priorities of the  business plan which is focused on the growth of reserves and production under strict capital discipline for the period    a box of up to us   million could be generated which allows paying for new investments with the box he said occidentals strategic alliance with ecopetrol will also allow it to progressively increase production until  when a net production of about  equivalent barrels per day kboed would be reached on average production would increase by about  kboed over the next  yearswe must advance in the approval of fracking it is an open secret in the oil industry that the dark geopolitical interests in latin america of countries like russia have managed to make fracturing or hydraulic stimulation  known as fracking  demonized in the region by deliberately leaving aside or ignoring that a good part of the oil and gas sold on the world market is being extracted from the ground with these newest techniques in the american continent alone fuels have been extracted from more than  wells in light of figures from the international energy agency which at the same time qualifies fracking as a revolution that is changing the world energy landscape in the short term according to the iea the united states has already risen to the top of world production thanks to the fact that the elite of the oil multinationals accessed its rich reserves to extract oil and gas through hydraulic stimulation it should be remembered that until a very few years ago the engine of the world economy was a net oil importer and that thanks to fracking it already surpassed russia the second largest producer in the world and surpassed saudi arabia in the race for the supply of crude to the world the above statements or conclusions are set out in the oil  report a document in which it is explained that the demand for crude oil continues to grow steadily at an annual average of  million barrels per day last year the demand record of  million barrels a day was reached a situation that explains with ample reasons ecopetrols decision to invest us   million in the united states a move that is not only historical and makes it a global player  but it allows it to enter the major leagues all from the hand of felipe bayon its president who has not only brought the company out of the crisis but was also able to take it to another level of development now ecopetrol enters the fracking business through the front door and curiously it does not do so in the country but in the united states with all the guarantees and legal security of the case it is great news for the economic country that ecopetrol continues to diversify its investment portfolio with the entry into the unconventional fields in the united states that is why the strategic alliance with occidental petroleum corp oxy to extract crude oil in the permian basin in texas is by far the news of the year for the joint venture the acquisition will allow it to achieve net production of up to  barrels per day in the future and incorporate proven reserves of  million barrels oxy will have a  stake while the colombian company will have  but the most important thing is the experience that will be acquired in hydraulic fracturing or fracking it is worth remembering that ecopetrol leads the hydraulic fracturing pilot tests that are to be carried out in the national territory the paradox of the matter is that while ecopetrol can become bigger in the united states with all the guarantees to do fracking here the legal power and the environmental forces continue to torpedo national development with unproven arguments about damage to nature ecopetrol once again rewrites the economic history of the countryecopetrol is ready to carry out exploration pilots in colombia the strategic alliance between ecopetrol and occidental petroleum corp for the exploitation and production of nonconventional reservoirs ync in the united states is just the beginning for the development of this type of technique by the company despite the fact that for the moment it will start with fracking in the north american country with the aim of gaining more experience and achieving better synergies the oil company reported that it has everything ready in colombia to start the first ync research pilots this was confirmed by the president of ecopetrol felipe bayon who assured that the implementation of this technology in the country will depend on the decision made by the council of state which is currently studying whether or not to regulate the development of nonconventional after suspending the regulations at the end of last year it is important to tell people that we are ready to do exploration pilots in colombia they are not exclusive they somehow complement each other the idea is not to do it quickly it is to do it well  we are taking advantage of this alliance with oxy to continue preparing ourselves said bayon one of the points on which the manager emphasized was the benefits that this alliance will bring to the country with the startup of fracking in permian united states the state oil company will be able to quickly add nearly  million barrels to its reserves in  this will allow it from the outset to increase its  oil selfsufficiency at least seven years as this would be added to the rest of the companys operation  years are the current reserves and  years can be incorporated if we replace all of this years production it allows a  increase in production in one year  explained the president the total payment of the us   million for this entire operation with occidental will be paid with the companys cash bayon confirmed that the oil company has reached significant financial strength which is why it is expected that the  business plan will generate up to us   million the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol it is important to tell people that we are ready to do exploration pilots in colombia they are not exclusive in some way they complement each other  ecopetrol has managed to maintain good cash stability working under a margin of us   per barrel its investment plan is key for the development of the country because it will bring greater income and profits to the nation and its shareholders in the medium term explained julio cesar vera expert and former president of acipet although ecopetrol has not yet confirmed how much the income could be from the exploration and production of unconventionals in the united states it did warn that these resources will benefit the country because it will allow the company to generate greater transfers so that the government can invest in education health or infrastructure  concluded bayon with all this commitment of the company in the united states and the synergies it plans to achieve with occidental for now it is estimated that the ecopetrol group will increase production progressively until  according to calculations in the medium term it would be able to produce net up to  barrels per daythe sebastopol refinery will begin construction in  and will be ready before the end of  with a capacity to process up to  barrels per day the colombian sebastopol refinery will begin construction no later than the first quarter of  after determining the viability of the resources with vip group international a private investment fund based in the united states it is expected that the project will have a development period of up to three years so according to its investors it could come into operation no later than  the new one industrial complex will have an area of  hectares and will be located in the municipality of puerto berrio near the magdalena river it will enter the system with the aim of being a complement to the cartagena refinery since it will be able to process from diesel to gasoline gasoline and jet fuel this was confirmed to lr german casas president of the sebastopol refinery who added that us   million will be invested for the entire project it will be us   million for the refinery us   million for the power plant and around us   million for the other units of the project  according to casas the new refinery will have five functional business units the fuel processing complex a  megawatt power plant a river port on the magdalena river an industrial park to complement transportation and a plant for the transfer of fuel finished products this is a project that once completed has a cash box in dollars of about us   million a day ecopetrol produces us   million a day but as we are smaller but we will have a generation plant port and refining we have a box that will allow us to pay debt explained the manager as they are located on the magdalena river from where refined products leave for the interior of the country oleoductos colombia and ocensa will be able according to casas to supply crude to the new refinery that is why the worleyparsons firm was hired for the design of the project which throughout this year will complete the designs and set the schedule for construction sebastopols entry into operation would mean that internally we could produce petroleum derivatives that we are importing today it is located in a strategic area that will be able to supply the consumption centers in the center of the country it will be a very good complement for the barrancabermeja and cartagena refineries explained carlos leal president of the acipet board of directors the startup of this project will generate up to  jobs in its construction phase it is believed by  it will already be in operation so it will offer between  to  job vacancies in the sectorecopetrol will present its financial

expensive dollar on tuesday the colombian peso recovered some of its losses against the dollar after the currency reached its historical price of   on monday the currency closed at an average price of   which despite representing a fall of   still maintains the dollar at its highest price if the impact of these increases on colombian companies is reviewed there are mixed conditions that cause both winners and losers the colombian stock exchange bvc is the ideal setting to evaluate these shocks in the main companies in the country in which colombians can invest their resources there on the side of those benefiting from the exchange rate ecopetrol cemargos and canacol stand out while among those that feel a negative impact are avianca cemex latam holdings nutresa among others according to the experts consulted the reaction of colombian stocks is usually downward when there are such significant increases in the dollar as these days alexandra cely equity analyst for equities and securities commented that this is due to the correlation that colcap has both with the currency and with oil so that in the last  days the index has lost close to  of its value up to  points regarding this it must be taken into account that despite the fact that oil has traded with slight falls an optimal level for the market is still maintained with a price close to us   per barrel in the case of brent a key figure for companies that make up the main stock index of the stock market now while in broad strokes the impact could be reviewed by sectors such as that the oil and gas sector would see gains for being exporters or the textile manufacturer losses due to the increase in the price of its imported inputs the experts preferred not to give a last word since that each company has different exposures to currency the contrasts carlos rodriguez manager of variable income at ultraserfinco the global rise in the dollar makes the main index of the local stock market fall due to a measure of risk which comes in part from the correlation of the market with the currency and the price of oil andres moreno stock market analyst the avianca issue is worrying because their correlation with the dollar and the price of their tickets is very high in addition to the fact that oil has not fallen so much and it represents an expense those who earn with a high dollar ecopetrol leads the companies on the stock market that benefit from the rise in the dollar at a time when the barrel of oil has not seen sharp falls that last and the dollar to which it is sold is high according to the companys first quarter report it produces  barrels per day which with oil at us   per barrel represents a daily production worth us   million this production with the dollar at the beginning of the year was equivalent to   million while with the current price of the dollar it rises   million as the oil revenues are in dollars when that money is brought in the margin will be much higher highlighted the stock market analyst andres moreno another that would experience a similar effect would be canacol because according to a casa de bolsa report a higher level of gas production is expected in annual terms and thus if it is effectively sold the flow of dollars to the company would support its cash in colombian pesos from the side of the cement companies there are two faces and the good one is cementos argos because according to carlos rodriguez ultraserfincos equity manager about  of the income of this company comes from the united states that in exchange for the peso represents a greater volume of earnings the companies that lose the negative side of the effects of the dollar in the cement sector is held by cemex latam holdings this according to cely due to the great exposure they have in other markets precisely rodriguez explained that the effects that the company would see are explained by the fact that half of its operation is in colombia while its reports are in dollars to this is added that  of its costs and expenses are dollarized  in a challenging environment in panama costa rica and other markets of the firms that make up colcap avianca could be the most affected as the rise in the dollar adds pressure to its difficult financial situation the airline has an international debt in bonds for us   million maturing in  an amount that was equivalent to   billion at the beginning of the year but which today rises to   billion in addition oil remains at a high value that the company must pay in dollars to supply its planes with the necessary fuel on the part of his sales rodriguez highlighted that the high dollar affects the prices of tickets reducing demand at the same time that it impacts operating costs in order to clean up its finances avianca is carrying out a plan to reprofile its debt and plans to expand these bonds until  giving extra guarantees in the case of nutresa the medellinbased food processor omar suarez casa de bolsas equity analyst highlighted that the devaluation of the colombian peso against the dollar creates pressure on the companys costs since the materials the premiums it uses are dollarized and according to utraserfinco about half of its costs are in dollars fabricato and coltejer would see the same type of impact due to the higher cost of imported textile inputs what stocks do experts recommend investing in for the

good results for ecopetrol after reaching important milestones such as the alliance with occidental to do fracking in the united states and reach  barrels of oil per day  more than  the oil company reported total profits of   billion as of june a figure that not only did it translate into  growth but it also represented the highest earnings since  for a first half the financial strength of the

good results in the first six months of the year according to its financial report total sales of the oil company reached   billion which represented an increase of  compared to   billion last year these results show the financial and operational strength of the company which faced a challenging market environment during the second quarter due to the fall in international prices of brent gasoline and gasoline  likewise the  devaluation of the exchange rate compared to the first half of  favored our results explained felipe bayon president of ecopetrol despite the fact that the price of brent oil fell  in the first semester and there were some operational limitations in certain fields and refineries the company managed to continue with its strategy of efficiencies and optimize investments related article ecopetrol will add  million barrels to the reserves with occidental in the united states in the first semester of the year   million of efficiencies were incorporated mainly concentrated in optimizing investments in drilling and construction of facilities said bayon who added  continuing the efficiencies strategy the new phase planned for the years  was launched with a goal of   billion one of the figures that stood out the most was the total production of the ecopetrol group in its financial report the company reported that  barrels of oil equivalent per day were reached in the semester which according to bayon is in line with the goal established for the end of  for german cristancho research director of davivienda corredores the growth in income and profits is in line with the increase in production levels that the company has presented the good operational dynamics and the exchange rate have influenced the company to enter new businesses and strengthen some lines of business such as refineries  the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol in the first semester of the year   million of efficiencies were incorporated mainly concentrated on optimizing investments german cristancho research director at davivienda corredores the growth in income and profits is in line with the increase in production levels good operational dynamics and the exchange rate had an influence  in terms of exports and exploration ecopetrol also made good progress the company highlighted that volumes sold abroad grew  reaching  barrels per day according to its financial report this indicator was mainly driven by higher exports of crude oil and products from the cartagena refinery on the exploratory front for its part the ecopetrol group continued to expand its presence in the colombian territory not only with the award of five blocks one for ecopetrol and four for hocol in the permanent process of allocation of areas of the national agency de hidrocarburos anh but also because it reported that hydrocarbons were found in three of the  exploratory wells drilled during the first semester of  the ecopetrol group executed us   million which represents an increase of  compared to the first semester of  with a concentration of  in the exploration and production segment said bayon this is how it was in the first quarteronly in the second quarter of the year ecopetrol reported that its revenues reached   billion a figure that represented a  growth in this item compared to   billion which were reported in the second quarter of  according to ecopetrol the increase in the average exchange rate in the second quarter positively impacted total revenues by more than   trillion despite the fact that colombia represented  of the oil companys sales compared to  of international revenues the company indicated in turn that total profits in this period alone were   billion for julio cesar vera former president of acipet the results of the second quarter are due to an adequate strategy of incorporating reserves a capital discipline and its diversification of the portfolio the entrance to the permian to do fracking in the united states is one of the most important events of this period that gives investors greater confidence we will invest up to us   million in  development wells this year geopark since geoparks arrival in colombia in  the company has focused its work on the llanos basin and has contemplated an investment of between us   and us   million to drill between  and  development wells and one exploratory well as explained by marcela vaca director for geopark colombia in addition vaca recalled that when they arrived in the country they had a production of zero barrels per day but with the passage of time they have managed to reach an operation of  barrels per day so they want to continue investing and hope to deliver more news in the third quarter of the year year about new projects how much have you invested in colombia this year and how much do you expect to invest in the coming years for this year we are planning an investment of us   to us   million to drill between  and  development wells and one exploratory well which we expect to hear from during the third quarter at this moment we are building the investment proposal for  in which fields is this investment and will it be focused we will continue working on conventional continental reservoirs until today the bet is concentrated in the llanos basin where we have deepened our knowledge but we will continue looking for opportunities in other basins that allow us to develop projects of this type how many barrels do they extract on average per month our average daily production so far this year is  barrels per day operating costs for each barrel are us   how is the process that you applied to explore and produce in  of the  anh blocks going in the recent permanent area allocation process led by the anh we allied ourselves with hocol a subsidiary of ecopetrol and we were awarded three blocks located in the departments of meta and casanare llanos  llanos  and llanos  there we hope to invest jointly between us   and us   million in the next three years for the acquisition of   of  seismic and the drilling of six exploratory wells why do you want to increase your presence in the country colombia is the most important country in geoparks portfolio in latin america we are interested in having a stake insofar as we consider that there is a stable regulatory framework that provides us stability in longterm projects the workforce is highly competent and of course there are opportunities to develop underground in addition to the deposits with hocol could you bet on exploration in other areas of the country with the assignment of the areas to the association that we make up with hocol in the framework of the ppaa  we will start the seismic acquisition campaign in the llanos  and  blocks in the coming years and we will continue evaluating opportunities to consolidate our presence which we will may lead to new deposits how has the sector performed this year and what are the expectations its been a good year we are excited about the reactivation of the area allocation processes that began with the ppaa and will culminate with the anh allocation of free areas scheduled for the end of the year we hope next year there will continue to be a favorable environment to continue working on the development of hydrocarbon projects social initiatives carried out by geopark in the regions why did you decide to hand over the  hectares since geopark arrived in colombia in complying with environmental obligations it has identified an opportunity to build a sustainable legacy in the regions where it operates the civil society natural reserve of  hectares that we donated at the beginning of august to the municipality of paz de ariporo is part of the fulfillment of the investment of  of the la cuerva block and becomes part of the environmental heritage of the casanarenos as it is a conservation area in perpetuity for its unique characteristics of flora and fauna how many people will benefit it is a benefit for the entire casanare the fact that municipalities have more protected areas dedicated to conservation is an opportunity to preserve unique habitats in the country and in the world and even to promote sustainable businesses such as ecotourism that is already taking place in other colombian reserves  what is the objective of this initiative we work to maximize the opportunities we have from the fulfillment of the environmental obligations contemplated in the licenses granted by anla for the benefit of the environment and the sustainability of the territories where we operate in this way we are building a legacy that we are sure will positively transcend in the municipalities where we carry out hydrocarbon exploration and production activities do you plan to replicate this initiative in other sectors it is our strategy since november of last year to date we have donated  hectares to the chingaza national natural park as part of the fulfillment of the environmental obligations of the  block located in the jurisdiction of the meta department in that case together with the directorate of natural parks we have worked for years to identify properties of the highest environmental value in the vicinity of the park to acquire and donate them and thus conserve the important environmental services that this ecosystem provides to the capital of colombia and the foothills of the plainsesenttia is studying expanding the capacity of the plant that operates in cartagena related article ecopetrol achieved the highest profit since  reaching   billion in june in an environment that demands more sustainable industries esenttia sa a company of the ecopetrol business group dedicated to producing and marketing raw materials for the plastic industry is also is adapting juan diego mejia president of the company commented on some of the projects they are working on some imports are integrated into their costs how much does the high dollar affect them the fluctuation of the dollar affects all industries we are a company with an export vocation we are a little shielded from the situation we export  of the production it really tends more to favor us than to harm us the contrasts oscar andres mendez founder of conceptos plasticos according to ellen macarthur foundation a pioneer in the circular economy issue  of plastic products are singleuse and  of packaging loses its value after use how many countries export to more or less  countries the main ones in latin america although we also export to europe mexico and the us how did you do last year and what is the goal for  we sell more or less us   million a year and we hope this year to be at that same level we are working on a project to continue growing but as long as we stay at this size we are optimizing how we approach the market what is this project about expansions to the plant in cartagena a  growth that is still in a phase prior to approval by the board what was the us   million investment in  focused on innovation is super important for companies and we are convinced that it works of course we innovate in product we focus on having a portfolio that differs those products will have to be more recyclable and environmentally friendly but we also innovate in processes and social issues how much does it affect you that many countries are banning the use of plastics all that avalanche of laws and regulations has the potential to affect the industry in general but singleuse plastics which are the ones that feel the most attacked are actually less than  despite the media issue growth projections in the coming years are above world gdp  or  because plastic is not only bags or disposables it is in everything containers and packaging are  of the industry there is still no technology that can replace itecopetrol affirmed that it will promote exploration in the caribbean with underwater drones ecopetrol informed that it will use unmanned submarine glider technology that will navigate a large area of the colombian caribbean to acquire information related to physicochemical variables of the ocean these are four teams known as the sea explorer a kind of submarine drones of french origin that will be in charge of doing oceanographic and geochemical exploration at sea to collect information to support the search for hydrocarbons and the generation of knowledge of the marine environment the oil company informed that the operation of the equipment will be in charge of the french firm alseamar designer and provider of these specialized services likewise the submarine gliders will be put into operation between august and december ecopetrol will have four gliders two in operation and two as relief which will navigate an area of  square kilometers  in a water column up to  meters deep the company reported with this technology the company continues to consolidate its business in the colombian caribbean more now that it works in offshore exploration with six exploration and production blocks in the colombian caribbean fuerte sur purple angel tayrona   and some ecopetrol shareholders believed that what they had was a cdt every week the commissioning firm global securities gathers ecopetrol investors in a special room at its headquarters to teach them about financial education alvaro jose aparicio president of the entity highlighted the need for this dynamic since many of its shareholders do not know what the securities they bought are about in an interview with lr the manager referred to this and other issues of the capital market mission and the current state of the stock market one of the comments about the regulation by activities and not by licenses proposed by the mission is that it would make competition stronger for independent firms what do you think there is a risk in the licenses that the government must measure quite well because the objective of the banking entities is not the stock market issue and we have seen that in all markets independent firms are important to specialize in niches we have natural persons which is the essence of the stock market and those measures that could be taken based on the mission could affect this type of stock broker and therefore the market could this lead to the independents having to merge to become stronger today there are only  stock brokers left and a few years ago we had been  the market has been reducing in number of players and has not increased in its net essence which is the stock market which is quite poor we must open the market to more actors with less demands for example from the equity point of view of the commission agents i understand what the market risk is because it makes no sense to place large equity figures on the commission agents to make a intermediation process whose risk is market risk and not own position another point is what the tax reform did to place double taxation on the market and we are feeling it the effect is zero in terms of state finances and it does affect the growth of the stock market which it hit very hard i think the government did not measure that effect these requirements ultimately impact costs how can we reduce them related article there is still room for costs to be reduced in the market cost is a determining factor for the natural person to join the market it is necessary to look at how other actors assume them but not the client it should be reviewed how they decrease with the provision of effective services such as implementing the digital theme highly liquid stocks do not exceed  and that is worrying for the market which also makes it tighter and more expensive every day measures must be taken by the government to reduce these effects reducing the cost chain and ensuring that all market players are acting on equal terms speaking of natural persons how to get them to enter the market we have a lot of experience precisely regarding ecopetrol investors and we have tried that these investors do not sell their participation in the market but on the contrary increase it with a view to other service strategies you have to educate people and we have been working on this with universities and unions weekly we have financial education processes in the company focused on telling them what the stock market is because it is a worrying thing that for example some of the clients with shares in ecopetrol were convinced that what they had was a cdt something absurd thus we have stopped the stampede the contrasts roberto rigobon director of the capital market mission the task of the government and the private sector is to educate financially so that people trust the industry more because the bad image it has comes from ignoring its work which other of the missions recommendations is it limited to or which do you think should be reviewed bond or share issuance processes should be streamlined while in the market the companies that want to issue bonds have a very long process they can pick up the phone call the bank and it gives them the money then the bank issues bonds with the calm of the case and that same money is delivered to investors so they are more dependent on the banking sector than on the stock market this is decisive for the investor to stop depending on the banks with higher costs due to reciprocity issues the commissioning firm is one of those with the most shareholders of the oil company global securities it is the third largest independent commission agent after ultraserfinco and actions  valores much of its proposal is in the management of resources of natural investors in ecopetrol since it has  of them according to a model of this group of investors made by the firm  of them are over  years old and  are in rural areas which makes contact difficultcommissioning firms and main issuers are the protagonists of the book of the stock market on april  the  years of the stock market in colombia were celebrated and two weeks ago the government received the results of the capital market mission that proposed a roadmap to professionalize the sector and get more companies to join this the perfect setting to continue the debate on the future of the capital market from the perspective of the private sector based on this the newspaper la republica launches tomorrow the book la bolsa en colombia

place within the framework of the forum the future of the capital market which will be held tomorrow tuesday august  at the externado university of colombia auditorium block a and will have the participation of jorge castano financial superintendent of colombia  jaime humberto lopez president of asobolsa and maria lorena gutierrez president of corficolombiana among other guests who will analyze the stock market as a means of business financing this will be a debate exercise that will present the success stories of companies such as grupo argos and corficolombiana and in addition it will be the stage to advance on the issues that the capital market mission put on the tablethe democratization of ecopetrol shares has been on the colombian stock exchange for  years related article some ecopetrol shareholders believed that what they had was a cdt thanks to its successful democratization process in the last decade ecopetrol has provided the nation with resources for more than   billion in dividends taxes and royalties and to date it is the issuer with the highest market capitalization on the colombian stock exchange the history of its shareholding democratization has its starting point in that at the time there was consensus for the company to be sustainable for this reason it was through law  of  that it was established that the best way to achieve this was to capitalize it in a percentage that would allow its conversion into a mixed economy company and the oil company was authorized to make a capitalization via the issuance of shares until  of its property in which citizens and the solidarity sector could participate on august   the first share offering began and subsequently in july  the second capitalization was made where colombians were able to become partners in the company currently  of the shares are held by the nation and the rest is in the hands of pension funds individuals foreign funds and companies legal entities among others

individuals from  departments participated after completing the award process  colombians became shareholders  of the placement remained in the hands of natural persons company shares broke records

in suspense due to social conflicts extensive procedures and public order  the study carried out by the colombian petroleum association acp revealed that this high number of suspended projects represent investments of up to us   million according to the union this figure is frozen by external variables that affect the business environment when the duque government began we had more than  contracts suspended for different reasons  contracts have already been reactivated and  are on the table hence the importance of continuing to work to reactivate them  explained francisco lloreda

a milestone in the energy transition process carried out by the company in which it is expected to increase from  megawatts to more than  megawatts in the power generation from renewable sources in the coming years in this sense the manager stressed that this is the beginning of the path so that renewable energies are definitely used in the companys operations this megapark that supplies energy to our castilla field in meta is the best demonstration of the energy transition colombia is experiencing said bayon the new solar plant has an area of approximately  hectares and will generate part of the energy consumed by campo castilla the second largest in the country with a production close to  barrels of oil per day when this government began we had  megabytes of installed capacity throughout colombia and we can say that in one year and two months the energy transformation began in the country and today ecopetrol becomes in just seven months the company with the largest selfgeneration with energy nonconventional renewables that was something unthinkable a few years ago today it is a reality there are  megabytes installed only in the castile project  highlighted the president of the republic ivan duque who attended the event the chief executive stated that a year ago the installed capacity of nonconventional renewable energies in the country was  of the energies in our matrix we will reach  in  and we have made an additional commitment reach  in  that is a sample of what the great energy ambition in our country is  finally president duque highlighted the commitment that the oil company has acquired with its investments ecopetrol only in its own consumption is committed to developing  megabytes of nonconventional renewable energy by  this means that only ecopetrol is going to contribute five times the installed capacity that colombia had in august of last year added the president the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol this megapark that supplies energy to our castilla field is the best demonstration of the energy transition in the country and demonstrates ecopetrols commitment to renewable energytomorrow  companies will

university of los andes it is important to bear in mind that with this new auction the governments plans are focused on expanding the national energy matrix  the analyst recalled that with this bid it is expected to reach  megawatts of renewable capacity this would mean investments of about us   million similarly german corredor director of the renewable energy association ser colombia commented that so far and one day before the auction begins everything has passed normally there is great expectation there are things that have last but they have not been informed as that the firms that are going to offer the generators should have put their guarantee of seriousness that is if in case it is awarded they will sign the contract but it is not yet known how many did that data is not public

production contract two off shore areas in the santos basin of brazil within the socalled presalt one of the areas with the largest hydrocarbon potential in the world with this agreement it is estimated that ecopetrol will be able to incorporate around  million barrels of crude oil in contingent resources as of next year with which production would reach close to  barrels per day in  once the agreement is finalized the participation shell will go from  to  although it will continue as operator the remaining  will continue to be in charge of the french company total as ecopetrol announced in addition to the oil companies the brazilian government also participates in the shared production contract through presal petroleo sa ppsa the entry into this discovery in the brazilian

production could reach approximately  barrels per day in  it is worth noting that the agreement would include two areas that correspond to the  concession contract and the south of shared production contract gato do mato two off shore areas in the santos basin of brazil within the socalled presalt one of the areas with the greatest hydrocarbon potential in the world in these two blocks three wells have been drilled that discovered light hydrocarbons in this sense the consortium will continue executing activities and operations aimed at starting production in the coming years this

first regulatory approvals in the united states with which it will be able to formalize the joint venture with the us oil company occidental oxy thanks to this it will be able to proceed with the use of technologies for unconventional exploitation such as fracking as described by the colombian company the extraction of hydrocarbons will take place in the permian basin located between the states of texas and new mexico which is considered one of the best and most prosperous for world production only from there more than four million barrels of oil are extracted per day it must be taken into account that the business agreement to be carried out has to do with oxy being the owner of  of the new company and the remaining  will be ecopetrol as it had been recently clarified this implies an important effort by the colombian state company since participation in this project and the startup of operations requires investments of more than us   million more than   billion at yesterdays exchange rate  the transaction is aligned with the strategic priorities of the  business plan focused on the growth of reserves and production under strict capital discipline supported by exploration recovery unconventional deposits and internationalization they explained in a statement finally it is important to note that in colombia the company is making progress in the comprehensive pilot research projects ppii in order to demonstrate the effects that the application of fracking would have on the local soil on these points it is now expected that next year will start with these pilots

billion and us   billion which would represent an increase of between  and  compared to the estimated number of organic investments for  the plan which was approved by the companys board of directors and that prioritizes opportunities under strict capital discipline according to the firm in a statement is aimed at maintaining the dynamics of growth and consolidation of the company materializing efficiencies that ensure profitability with a sustainability approach in energy environmental and social matters  related article ecopetrol would end this year with investments of up to us   billion the plan was built with an expectation of brent price in a range of us   to us   per barrel in this range the plan aims to ensure an average return on capital employed above  which would maintain ecopetrol as one of the companies with the highest value generation among its peers and with which efficiencies of   are expected  trillion which would be added to the more than   trillion reached in the last five years the plan contemplates an equilibrium price at which a positive net profit would be generated in  of around us   per barrel which shows the companys resilience to fluctuations in the price of oil they add in the document in exploration the company plans to drill  exploratory wells located in the basins of greater materiality with emphasis on colombia for a total of  within the national territoryecopetrol will produce up to  barrels of crude per day in  according to its projections increasing exploration and production advancing the energy transition and guaranteeing the operation of the barrancabermeja and cartagena refineries will be three of the main investment axes that ecopetrol will have in  the oil company which plans to invest up to us   billion next year seeks to continue consolidating the good management of its finances at the same time that it is committed to a production of up to  barrels of oil per day the new investment plan will be aimed at maintaining the growth path that ecopetrol has achieved in recent years with an expectation of a brent in the range of us   to us   per barrel the company will divide its action plan into three fronts  for exploration and production  for refining and transportation and the remainder in energy transition  socioenvironmental investment and digital transformation this plan includes a significant increase in our investments to continue the path of profitable and sustainable growth furthermore it outlines the route for the group to make an orderly energy transition in line with our commitment to contribute to the countrys energy security and to produce more and more clean energy  explained felipe bayon president of ecopetrol one of the reasons that will allow the company to continue growing is the projection it makes in order to make a profit according to the oil company this plan includes an equilibrium price of us   per barrel a figure with which according to the firm it would continue to generate profits in the exploration and production segment a large part of these investments  will be allocated to projects in colombia while the remainder will be invested in the positioning and development of the groups operations in the united states mexico and brazil thus it is estimated that in  there will be the drilling of  exploratory wells of which  will be located in the country and two internationally the contrasts felipe bayon president of ecopetrol this plan includes an increase in our investments to continue the path of profitable and sustainable growth in addition it traces the route to make an energy transition  in addition to these expectations according to the company they already have us   million on the table to advance in the evaluation and development of the companys offshore blocks in terms of unconventional reservoirs on the contrary the initiatives to develop pilot projects in the middle magdalena valley basin and the scaling up of development activities in the permian basin in texas united states will continue the other investments that the company will make will be focused on transportation  and refining  on this last front in fact progress continues in the interconnection project of the original crude unit of the cartagena refinery with the new refinery according to ecopetrol investments of us   million are contemplated for this initiative next year in transportation for its part  million barrels per day are expected to be transported all this while investing us   million for the energy transition of the company which has the goal of reducing  million tons of  by  this investment plan shows that the company is interested in growth sustainable in the face of the production and exploration challenges they face today  concluded carlos leal president of the board of directors of acipethocol bought  of the operation of the chuchupa and ballena fields in la guajira when analyzing the history of natural gas in colombia the prominence of the ballena and chuchupa fields in la guajira stands out for the consolidation of the sector after being found in the  by texaco today chevron they became the starting point for governments to begin regulating this segment related article ecopetrol will produce up to  barrels of crude per day in  according to its projectionsfor example in  the first regulations on the management of prices and quotas for the distribution of deposits were promoted in  the program gas for the change and so on each government together with private companies and ecopetrol gave shape to this sector and it is precisely this consolidation that has attracted the attention of various companies in the sector one example of this is that hocol signed an agreement with chevron petroleum company to acquire its stake in the chuchupa and ballena fields located in the department of la guajira with this move after more than  years chevron will stop operating these fields in la guajira according to hocol these fields are operated by chevron through the guajira association contract  ecopetrol and  chevron under the terms of the agreement hocol will acquire the participation of chevron  and will take the position of operator  regarding this transaction which is still subject to approval by the superintendency of industry and commerce sic rafael guzman president and ceo of hocol said that they are committed to continue generating value to the country and the environments where we operate as well as to contribute to the supply of gas for the colombian north coast  the signing of the agreement took place on november ecopetrol will invest up to us   million for the fracking pilots ecopetrol will invest up to us   million for the evaluation and development of research pilots for nonconventional reservoirs ync in the country after revealing its investment plan this week which includes between us   billion and us   billion for  the oil company continues to work on the baselines although they are still waiting for the protocols defined by the ministry of mines and energy the us   million that are planned for the unconventionals would go to the preparatory research and exploration phase this was confirmed by felipe bayon president of ecopetrol who explained that today there are between us   million and us   million for this activity we said we had a bigger budget but time will determine what the investments will look like we will do the pilots with the industry and in a transparent way  the manager assured that at this moment the company is working in the preparatory phase not only with professionals in the country but also with collaborators who are gaining experience and knowledge in permian united states the most prolific unconventional basin in the world and in which occidental petroleum corp already works in fact according to bayon this exercise will allow the company to include up to  million barrels in ecopetrols reserves this year although we are still waiting for the regulation that the government will take out following the recommendations of the expert commission the oil company already has an analysis of the areas with the greatest potential for unconventional gas and oil reserves in this list for example we find the middle valley of magdalena cesarrancheria catatumbo and valle inferior del magdalena it is expected that the environmental impact studies of the anla will be completed and also the delivery of the protocols which are expected to be ready in the first quarter of next year the companies continue forward and it is expected that by the end of next year the initial execution of the pilots can take place however this should be a technical discussion and not a political one explained carlos leal president of the acipet board of directors while the government advances these preparations it should be noted that at this moment there are nine contracts in suspense due to the suspensions of the national hydrocarbons agency and the restrictions of the state council these are projects located in cesar santander antioquia and la guajira which belong to ecopetrol drummond parex and conocophillips in fact the latter company also announced that it is awaiting regulation as it has up to us   million ready to invest in pilots the benefits although the pilots would only be for research studies by the oil unions detail that the country has a high potential to develop commercial fracking according to these calculations the estimated contribution of the ync in the next  years would total up to us   million that is more than   billion in the long termecopetrol calls an extraordinary shareholders meeting for december  at the request of the ministry of finance and public credit ecopetrol called an extraordinary shareholders meeting for next monday december  in which the proposal to release the occasional reserve that was constituted in the past ordinary shareholders meeting will be submitted for consideration march  the amount of this occasional reserve amounts to   trillion and was established with net profits generated in   and  the ministry highlighted that it proposes that these resources be released so that before the end of the year they be distributed as dividends for all shareholders in the case of the dividends that correspond to the government their purpose will be to finance public investment necessary to boost the growth of the economy he says in the statement from minhacienda from this portfolio it was also indicated that the release of this reserve in  does not affect the future sustainability of the oil company or compromise its short and mediumterm investment plan it was also clarified that it is not an advance of dividends for next year nor does it modify the policy that the company has approved on this aspect if the proposal is approved the nation which is ecopetrols majority shareholder would receive close to   billion while minority shareholders would obtain around   billioncommercial gas production has grown  more than the same period in  between january and october  commercial gas production reached

ecopetrol felipe bayon assured today at the colombian energy summit held at the bogota chamber of commerce that by the end of next year the drilling of the fracking research pilots would be made although bayon assured that the company is already working on the baselines of this technique he warned that everything will happen if the government defines the necessary protocols to take the next step it is noteworthy that the oil company is already producing  barrels per day with fracking in the united states according to the manager after four months of the alliance with oxy the first fracturing and drilling are already taking place what are the protocols the minister of mines and energy maria fernanda suarez also confirmed that in the first semester of  the protocols that would define how these first research pilots will be carried out will come out although he did not give an exact date he confirmed that six issues are being worked on to define regulation seismicity water and biodiversity health transparency law technical regulations and social aspects it is estimated that with this regulation companies will be clear about the next step and how the development of this technique will be among the most potential areas to start the first pilots are the middle magdalena valley cesar  rancheria and catatumbocorporate governance must be seen as the main business asset in colombia companies have been traditionally measured for years that is by operating income profits ebitda margin and other financial variables however today one of the most important assets for companies is corporate governance this is a thesis shared by almost all the presidents and board members of major companies corporate governance seen as the strategy or plans of good administrative practices that each company designs is the roadmap of the real sector in colombia and in the world due to its impact on investment decisionmaking related article the roles that the members of the boards of directors should have according to experts corporate governance is perhaps one of the main assets of a company concluded rafael herz president of the board of directors of grupo energia bogota during his participation in the forum corporate governance a business asset for the manager the message is not to discuss whether the ownership of a company is public or private but rather that in its corporate governance it respects the values and interests of minority shareholders that it generates value for shareholders and interest groups  he assured during his speech for herz who is an independent member of the board of directors today grupo energia bogota is a multilatina with operations in guatemala brazil peru and colombia but the most important thing that happened in corporate governance was the sale of geb shares in the colombian stock exchange at that time the structural situation was the indicated one despite the fact that in general there was not a very good atmosphere he said the contrasts monica jimenez gonzalez general secretary of ecopetrol people now say i want to work at ecopetrol because corporate governance is robust and it is an issue that matters it is not only about investment issues  sandra patricia perea delegate for issuers and other agents of the superfinancial there is a direct relationship between the application of good governance practices and the operational performance of companies hence its importance in the sector this for the manager was the most important transaction in colombia in the last four years and the milestones at that time indicated to protect shareholders from such interference from the political ups and downs that may occur the second was the balance between the rights of the majority shareholder and the minority shareholders and that was established in the statutes that were made the idea is to generate value for all shareholders he said another aspect that he highlighted in the geb case is that today those who judge companies do not only do so on financial matters but also on social and sustainability issues the group proposed three things first the protection of the interests of minority shareholders second the recognition of the condition of the capital district as the majority shareholder and third the respect and incorporation of the interests of the other shareholders of the company this thesis was shared by sandra patricia perea diaz delegate for issuers and other agents of the financial superintendence of colombia who said during her speech that without a doubt the corporate governance is decisive when making decisions there is a direct relationship between the application of good governance practices and its operational performance the boards of directors that contribute to strategic business decisions are increasingly important  for experts before there was talk of generating value for shareholders today there is talk of generating value for stakeholders but what is ultimately sought is a strengthening of decisionmaking that each person who is interested in investing in a company knows its information according to monica jimenez general secretary of ecopetrol investment and labor decisions take into account corporate governance the strategy must be tied to the kind of company you have and its size updating the corporate governance is essential because it allows the results to be measured  what did the geb do as explained by the chairman of the geb board of directors the corporate governance plan focused on robust practices to protect the company from political interference and generate value for all shareholders of the company the changes in the groups shareholding structure after the issuance of shares were as follows although the district continues with the highest number of shares it went from  to  for their part pension funds increased their position from  to  as for natural investors their participation doubled from  to  corporate governance and good practices are an issue that has been on the table with more emphasis since colombia began its process to be part of the oecd countries in the strict evaluation made by this organization one of the aspects taken into account was that of good business practices where colombian companies committed to having international standards of good corporate management in this context the geb also had to adjust its strategies to respond to these needs according to herz the group has complied with  of the oecds recommendations on corporate governance with  measures adopted in  finally another aspect highlighted by the chairman of the board of directors was the participation of the independent in this organization relevant decisions require a quorum and a special majority six favorable votes from seven independent members present as a challenge it was proposed to ensure the continuity of the process since it is normal that there are political changes as now with the new mayor but it is necessary to guarantee that this continuity is maintainedthe anh will end this year with  oil and gas blocks awarded in line with the objective of the government and the ministry of mines and energy to reactivate the oil sector the national hydrocarbons agency continues in the task of attracting investment from the sector to the country and to this end yesterday it held the hearing of counter offers for this second round that it advances to deliver oil blocks in which the companies had the opportunity to make counterproposals to the initial offers as a result  new contracts were awarded in this second cycle of the permanent area allocation process ppaa luis miguel morelli president of the anh affirmed that of  areas that we offered in   were awarded that is a success rate higher than the world average which is  here we had a higher than   in the day of counter offers in this second auction the entity assured that only one block received a counter offer number six called llanos  located in the llano basin the contrasts nicolas mejia vice president of promotion and allocation of areas of the anh we want to have defined the modifications to the regulations to agreement  to have clear and definitive rules of the game for  and for the industry to show us their observations luis miguel morelli president of the national hydrocarbons agency we are going to have two cycles next year for the award because we have to make two cuts in the year while the companies show their proposals for this it was known that parex made double the offer that the temporary union of geopark and hocol had made which initially was us   million in the first two exploration phases given this news morelli added that there is still a replica the counter offer next thursday that can be made by hocol and geopark and can go up a little more if they want to keep the block in this way as it is the only block that remains in the bid the counter offer will be validated by an independent auditing firm and on december  the anh will publish its acceptance or not and later on december  the temporary union among the companies that did not counteroffer yesterday that is geopark and hocol they will be able to make a better proposal at the us   million that parex put in and that same day the winner of the last block in dispute will be known out of  contracts awarded were in the hands of these companies llanos  de hocol llanos  of frontera energy llanos  for ecopetrol plains  for the temporary union between parex and ecopetrol llanos  was in charge of the temporary union between geopark and hocol putumayo  and  for gran tierra energy colombia lower magdalena valley  for canacol also for the same company valle medio del magdalena  and  and valle medio del magdalena  for parex of the  blocks with which eight companies were left the only one that did not receive a counter proposal was block number six sinu  for which the temporary union lunacaptiva and hocol had bid in the last auction morelli concluded that the  remaining areas to be awarded of the  areas that were offered in  are available for the next semester to be able to go out and offer them by new investors since according to the manager this contributes to gdp in a significant percentage  proposal to the board of directors of the anh to reform the regulations the president of the national hydrocarbons agency also said that they are proposing to the board of directors of the entity that a reform of the regulations be made which allows the entry of new investors to the country according to the manager what they want to propose is that the entry protocols be made more flexible as long as the requirements are reduced since they range from requiring that companies that are going to invest have more than us   million of equity until they produce at least  barrels of crude per daysummary of the year january the sale of  of ecopetrol would fall well the possible sale of  of ecopetrol shares was one of the letters that was discussed that the national government would put on the table to guarantee the fiscal stability of the country this decision which should go to ministerial consideration and presidential approval could not only be very popular with the nation but also with the market selling this share percentage would add to another of the oil companys milestones in the possible scenario that this is achieved ecopetrol would continue with an  shareholding since among other things the nation today has a participation of  after two share disposal processes were carried out  and  where it offered  of its titles although voices are heard for and against this decision is within the regulatory framework this is indicated by law  of  which authorized the oil company to issue shares to be placed on the market under a single condition the nation must keep at least  of the titles that are in circulation one way to mitigate this impact is by generating additional resources through the recomposition of the governments business or investment portfolio in this context the operation that the ministry announces with a percentage of ecopetrol shares for which there is already authorization from congress is a very good idea  explained jorge humberto botero president of fasecolda and who put this on the table discussion last year the sale of this  would be comparable to the process that was carried out  years ago  at this time the company opened the first sale round and offered  million shares a figure that represented the sale of  of the companys stake the sales of years ago meant that today a group of shares of the oil company is in charge of private parties and retailers in fact although ecopetrol retains the majority share  is in charge of private companies jp morgan chase porvenir proteccion among others and retailers for the president of the association of stock brokers jaime humberto lopez this movement would have gone down very well in the market not only because of the increase in liquidity but also because of the number of new investors that would enter what would be the steps to bid according to the project that was known the law establishes that the government must design a disposal program according to the regulations this will have to have the corresponding technical studies at the end of this process the project will be submitted to the council of ministers for consideration which after a favorable opinion will forward it to the president for approval subsequently this concept must be passed for the knowledge of the congress of the republic when analyzing how much income the sale of that  of the shares to the government would represent we would be talking about

on drummonds operation puts us   billion a year in suspense the contempt for the order to halt the exploration and exploitation of unconventional deposits by drummond led the council of state to suspend the companys operation in  wells located at its mine in cesar for the experts this decision puts several projects that seek to develop in the country and that would have investments of us   billion annually once they reach the production stage the company which has positioned itself as one of the main producers of thermal coal with colombia has  remaining unexploited wells however they indicated that the first  had a prior permit to be exploited since horizontal fracturing was not considered what which is known as fracking but vertical fracturing a technique that has been used for years in the country however the council of state clarified that since it is gas associated with coal the effects of the suspension would be extended as it is an unconventional deposit and pointed out that only research in pilot projects was allowed at this stage the contrasts carlos leal president of the board of directors of acipet in technical terms these wells have a vertical fracturing so they are not within the fracking condition although they are ync because they are made of coal beds regarding the decision carlos leal president of the acipet board of directors affirmed that it affects the country because by not developing the pilots drummond headed one of the four that are being advanced the potential of unconventional deposits is being wasted  ync in colombia which is  cubic

future of the technique in the country and that hits a source very important that could be harnessed for gas development hydrocarbon that this is called to be the energy of transition  regarding the future of the project vera explained that surely now there will be an appeal by drummond and some intervening agents around this measure but the final point will be reached when the council makes a
